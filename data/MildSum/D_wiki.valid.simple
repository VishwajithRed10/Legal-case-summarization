The Supreme Court observed that appointment to the heirs of the employees on their retirement/ superannuation is violative of Articles 14 and 15 of Constitution of India If such an appointment is permitted, in that case, outsiders shall never get an appointment and only the heirs of the employees on their superannuation and/or retirement shall get an appointment and those who are the outsiders shall never get an opportunity to get an appointment though they may be more meritorious and/or well educated and/or more qualified, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed In this case, an Industrial Court directed the Ahmednagar Mahanagar Palika to give appointment to the heirs of the employees on their retirement and/or superannuation. The direction was based on a settlement award between the Employees Union and the Mahanagar Palika in which one of the demand by the Union was that legal heirs of the employees must be employed on retirement. The Gujarat High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Mahanagar Palika challenging this order. Before the Apex Court, Advocate Suhas Kadam, who appeared for the appellant - Mahanagar Palika , contended that such a direction to give appointment to the heirs of the employees on their retirement/superannuation shall be hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India and against the object of providing appointment on compassionate grounds. On the other hand, Advocate Iyer Shruti Gopal for the respondents contended that the appointment to the heirs of the employees on their superannuation and/or retirement cannot be said to be an appointment on compassionate grounds but it is called varas hakka and therefore any decision of this Court on compassionate appointment shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. The court noted that the employees of the Mahanagar Palika/Municipal Corporation are governed by the scheme of the State Government at par with the government employees, which does not provide for appointment on compassionate grounds to the heirs of the employees on their retirement and/or superannuation.  While allowing the appeal, the bench observed: "Even otherwise, such an appointment to the heirs of the employees on their retirement and/or superannuation shall be contrary to the object and purpose of appointment on compassionate grounds and is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. As observed and held by this Court in a catena of decisions, compassionate appointment shall always be treated as an exception to the normal method of recruitment. The appointment on compassionate grounds is provided upon the death of an employee in harness without any kind of security whatsoever. The appointment on compassionate grounds is not automatic and shall be subject to the strict scrutiny of various parameters including the financial position of the family, the economic dependence of the family upon the deceased employee and the avocation of the other members of the family. No one can claim to have a vested right for appointment on compassionate grounds. Therefore, appointment on compassionate grounds cannot be extended to the heirs of the employees on their superannuation and/or retirement. If such an appointment is permitted, in that case, outsiders shall never get an appointment and only the heirs of the employees on their superannuation and/or retirement shall get an appointment and those who are the outsiders shall never get an opportunity to get an appointment though they may be more meritorious and/or well educated and/or more qualified. Therefore, the submission on behalf of the respondent that the appointment is not on compassionate grounds but the same be called as varas hakka cannot be accepted. Even if the same be called as varas hakka the same is not supported by any scheme and even the same also can be said to be violative of Article 14 as well as Article 15 of the Constitution of India"  Case details Ahmednagar Mahanagar Palika vs Ahmednagar Mahanagar Palika Kamgar Union |  (SC) 739 | CA 5944 OF 2022 | 5 September 2022 | Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna  Headnotes Constitution of India, 1950 ; Articles 14,15 - Appointment to the heirs of the employees on their retirement and/or superannuation shall be contrary to the object and purpose of appointment on compassionate grounds and is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India - Appointment on compassionate grounds cannot be extended to the heirs of the employees on their superannuation and/or retirement - Appointment on compassionate grounds cannot be extended to the heirs of the employees on their superannuation and/or retirement.

Dealing with an estranged couple's case related to the custody of their children, the Madras High Court in a recent order said marriage is not for "mere satisfying the carnal pleasure" but mainly for the purpose of progeneration.

Dealing with an estranged couple's case related to the custody of their children, the Madras High Court in a recent order said marriage is not for "mere satisfying the carnal pleasure" but mainly for the purpose of progeneration.   "...this Court would like to stress and impress upon the persons, who have tied the marital knot that the concept of marriage is not for mere satisfying the carnal pleasure, but it is mainly for the purpose of progeneration, which leads to the extension of the familial chain. The child born out of the said wedlock is the connecting link between the two individuals, who have been united over a sacred oath, taken by both," said the court, while parting with the order.  Justice Krishnan Ramasamy was dealing with a petition filed by a woman, lawyer by profession, for interim custody of her two minor sons from her husband, who is also a lawyer.   Stating that though courts are mindful of the interest of the child, Justice Ramasamy said it is "to be lamented" that the law leaves the child "with only one hand, rather than two". The court also said child "brought into this vicious world through the act of the two individuals for their pleasure" is made to suffer for no fault of his. "Law can satisfy the ego, but it can never the satisfy the requirements of the child, as the framers of the law were only conscious of the welfare of the child and not on the mental turmoil that would be faced by a child in such a calamitous situation," said the bench.  Describing children as the greatest gift to humanity, the court further said: "Parents regain peace and happiness in the company of the children. Parents are the best judge on the mental turmoil that their child faces and when they become the perpetrator of the said holocaust, the 'home' a heavenly abode, turns into a 'house', which is just built with brick and mortar, whereas a 'home' is build with love and affection of all the persons who reside in the said heavenly abode."  The court also said that to turn a child against a parent is to turn the child against himself and termed "parental alienation" as inhuman. It said: "A parent indulging in parental alienation, means, he/she is polluting the tender mind of the innocent child by potraying the mother/father as a villian, which would have a considerable impact on him/her throughout his/her life and he/she develops ill feelings towards the parent and started hating his own father/mother."  The applicant, mother, had sought interim custody of the two children by contending that the respondent husband had failed to comply with the court orders granting her visitation rights. The respondent father was thus "tormenting the tender children to their detriment".   The respondent father, on the other hand submitted that the applicant never bothered about her children since their birth and that it was he who looked after both the kids. The respondent also submitted that the children themselves did not want to spend time with their mother. He also submitted that the applicant, for her own professional growth, had completely neglected the children.  The court, after going through the materials on record, was convinced that the respondent father had "poisoned the minds of the minor children against their mother" and had acted against the welfare of the children. He had not taken any effort to teach the children about the importance of the mother and had not allowed them to get her love and affection, said the court.  Further, the court also observed that the father had failed to comply with its previous orders, even after having knowledge about the court orders and the consequences of failure to comply with the same, thus giving scant regard to the orders of the Court and indulging in parental alienation.  Thus, the court held that he was not competent to continue having the custody of the minor children and gave custody to the mother.

The Delhi High Court has observed that the officers of Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trade Mark must practice due application of mind while rendering decisions and that template or “cut-paste” orders must be discouraged and cannot sustain. While pulling up an Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs for passing a “mechanical order” while refusing an application for grant of patent, Justice Sanjeev Narula observed: “Reasoning through a speaking order is a vital aspect of the principles of natural justice and is of utmost importance, which needs to be underscored. If the patent office’s orders lack proper reasoning, it may be difficult for the applicant to identify the grounds for appeal. The legal proposition that an order of such kind should be supported by reasons, needs no reiteration.” The court was hearing a plea moved by Blackberry Limited challenging the order passed by Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs refusing its application filed in 2008 for registration of patent for “Text Selection Using a Touch Sensitive Screen of a Handheld Mobile Communication Device.” The impugned order was passed on June 23, 2020.  Setting aside the impugned order, the court observed that the reasons for dismissing Blackberry’s argument were merely a “word-for-word replication” of its claims, adding that no reasoning was discernible from the same.  “Simply remarking that subject invention is not patentable being a mathematical or business method, a computer programme per se, or an algorithm is not sufficient,” the court said.  It added: “Not only does this benefit the applicant, whose rights are likely to be affected, but also assists the Court in ascertaining how the concerned officer applied their minds and reached the impugned conclusion, while exercising judicial review.” The court also noted that a co-ordinate bench recently passed a similar order wherein it was observed that the officers of the Controller of Patents and Designs office must bear in mind that the question of grant and rejection of a patent is a serious matter.  “Indeed, these words must resonate with the authorities, and it must be ensured that Patent Controller’s officers practice due application of mind while rendering decisions. Well-articulated reasons in such orders would demonstrate that the decision has been made with proper consideration and allows for more effective judicial review, if necessary,” Justice Narula said.  The court remanded the matter back to the office of Controller of Patents for re- consideration.  “Prior to deciding the matter afresh, Appellant shall be granted a hearing. Application for subject invention shall not be decided by the Officer who passed the impugned order,” it said.  Title: BLACKBERRY LIMITED v. ASSISTANT CONTROLLER OF PATENTS AND DESIGNS

The Supreme Court observed that the failure of a builder to obtain occupation certificate is a deficiency in service under Consumer Protection Act 1986. The flat purchasers are well within their rights as 'consumers' to pray for compensation as a recompense for the consequent liability such as payment of higher taxes and water charges by the owners arising from the lack of an occupancy certificate, the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna observed. In this case, the complaint was filed by  Samruddhi Co-operative Housing Society Ltd for refund of the excess taxes and charges paid to the municipal authorities, due to the alleged deficiency of service of the builder- Mumbai Mahalaxmi Construction Pvt. Ltd. The complainant contended that due to the failure of the builder to obtain the occupancy certificate, its members have had to pay a 25% higher amount on account of the property tax and an additional 50% towards the water charges. he National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was barred by limitation and that it was not maintainable since it was in the nature of a recovery proceeding and not a consumer dispute. According to NCDRC, the Housing society is not a 'consumer' under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act as they have claimed the recovery of higher charges paid to the municipal authorities from the builder. In appeal, the bench noted that Sections 3 and 6 of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) imposes an obligation on builder to provide the occupancy certificate to the flat owners. Apart from this, the promoter must make payments of outgoings such as ground rent, municipal taxes, water charges and electricity charges till the time the property is transferred to the flat-owners. Where the promoter fails to pay such charges, the promoter is liable even after the transfer of property. The court thus observed: "It is evident that there was an obligation on the respondent to provide the occupancy certificate and pay for the relevant charges till the certificate has been provided. The respondent has time and again failed to provide the occupancy certificate to the appellant society. For this reason, a complaint was instituted in 1998 by the appellant against the respondent. The NCDRC on 20 August 2014 directed the respondent to obtain the certificate within a period of four months. Further, the NCDRC also imposed a penalty for any the delay in obtaining the occupancy certificate beyond these 4 months. Since 2014 till date, the respondent has failed to provide the occupancy certificate. Owing to the failure of the respondent to obtain the certificate, there has been a direct impact on the members of the appellant in terms of the payment of higher taxes and water charges to the municipal authority. This continuous failure to obtain an occupancy certificate is a breach of the obligations imposed on the respondent under the MOFA and amounts to a continuing wrong. The appellants therefore, are entitled to damages arising out of this continuing wrong and their complaint is not barred by limitation." The court observed that rejection of the complaint as being barred by limitation, when the demand for higher taxes is made repeatedly due to the lack of an occupancy certificate, is a narrow view which is not consonance with the welfare objective of the Consumer Protection Act 1986. While holding that the complaint was maintainable, the bench observed: Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act defines a 'consumer' as a person that avails of any service for a consideration. A 'deficiency' is defined under Section 2(1)(g) as the shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality of service PART D 17 that is required to be maintained by law. "In the present case, the respondent was responsible for transferring the title to the flats to the society along with the occupancy certificate. The failure of the respondent to obtain the occupation certificate is a deficiency in service for which the respondent is liable. Thus, the members of the appellant society are well within their rights as 'consumers' to pray for compensation as a recompense for the consequent liability (such as payment of higher taxes and water charges by the owners) arising from the lack of an occupancy certificate" In this regard, the bench referred to the following decisions viz. Wing Commander Arifur Rahman Khan & Others v. DLF Southern Homes Private Limited & Others (2020) 16 SCC 512 and Pioneer Urban Land Infrastructure Limited v.

While hearing a reference from a single judge, a Division Bench of Jharkhand High Court has held that in petition filed jointly by several persons, one single court fee is justified where there is a common interest.

While hearing a reference from a single judge, a Division Bench of Jharkhand High Court has held that in petition filed jointly by several persons, one single court fee is justified where there is a common interest. However, when the interests are merely similar but not common, separate court fee has to be filed.  Emphasizing the difference between the two, Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad noted, "if the interests among the petitioners are common or joint when they claim an interest as class or group, in that case only one set of court fee would be payable but when the interest is not common but similar in the sense that each of the petitioners has suffered individual injury as a result of the impugned order, then in that case though the interest is similar it cannot be termed as common interest and in such type of cases separate court fee is required to be paid." In the instant case, pertaining to absorption as permanent employees, the Court noted, "It is not the case that in case of relief is granted to one of the writ petitioners; then all the writ petitioners would be benefited automatically. Separate orders of authority would be required to be passed for their absorption considering the individual case. Thus, in our considered opinion, in the present case, separate sets of Court fee is required to be filed by the writ petitioners." The petitioners working as Para Teachers had filed a case for a direction to the respondents to take steps to absorb their services as a permanent regular teachers as done by other State Governments.  The issue for determination was as to whether all the petitioners would have to file a separate set of court fee or only one court fee is sufficient. The Registrar General had overruled the objection raised by the office for filing a separate court fee based on an order dated 20.09.2018 passed by a Division Bench in an earlier writ petition, holding that, "Registry is not justified in directing the petitioner to pay separate set of court-fee as the petitioners have filed only one writ petition. If the writ petitions would have been filed separately, then there would have been justification in asking for separate sets of court-fee." However, in the instant case the Single Judge referred to decisions of the Patna High Court in Promod Kumar Akela & ors. vs. The Director, BIT, Sindri, Dhanbad and ors. (( LPA No. 100 of 1999(R)) where it was noted in a batch of 23 petitioners each of them had the independent cause of action arising out of termination of their respective services and thus must pay separate court fees. Therefore, the matter was referred before the Division Bench in light of the two conflicting decisions. The Court rejected the 2018 decision (where it was held that since only one writ petition has been filed, a separate set of court fees was not required) for the reason that the aforesaid decision has been rendered without considering the earlier judicial pronouncements and, therefore, that would not have binding precedent. Concurring with the Patna High Court judgment, the Bench emphasized that when the interest is not common but similar in the sense that each of the petitioners has suffered individual injury, separate set of court fees must be filed. In the case at hand, the Court noted, the petitioners were claiming their rights, and there is no jural relationship between the writ petitioners. It noted,  "Their cases can be of a similar interest but is not of common interest. As mandamus has been sought for their individual absorption in service, it cannot be held that they pursue a common and joint interest or a class as a whole rather, they are pursuing their interest. Therefore, it has to be understood that ten they are pursuing their relief, although they may have similar interest." The Court noted that the petition should be deemed to have been presented separately on behalf of each of the petitioners. It observed that if each of the petitioners has similar interests, they may be allowed to present a joint petition, but they would be required to pay a separate court fee for payment of the court fee. It remarked,  It also reiterated based on judicial precedents that the Stamp Reporters would be duty-bound to make scrutiny when several writ petitioners file a writ petition as to whether separate court fee would be required or a single Court fee would be sufficient and as per the law declared.

"Since 75th Independence Day Celebrations, Government has marked Azadi-ka-Amrit Mahotsav terming it to be 'Amrit Kaal' with prospective vision in the welfare of citizens of the country, however, Police Administration feels more comfortable to remain with colonial structure," the Allahabad High Court observed recently while taking exception to a counter affidavit filed by the state in an anticipatory bail plea stating that the applicant is of criminal intent. The bench of Justice Manju Rani Chauhan also took to task the deponent of the counter affidavit (Deputy Superintendent of Police/ Circle Officer, Sahawar, District Kasganj) by observing that the officer believed himself to be empowered with sanction to author a certificate of the propensity of a person without any cogent material. "A bare reading of the averments in counter affidavit whereby the applicant is said to be of criminal intent appears to be on the basis of skewed information. No such officer is allowed to enjoy impunity on the pretext of discharging official functioning nor can be set free to form an audacious remark without any basis," the bench observed. The Court also found faults with Government Counsel I.P.S. Rajpoot, AGA-I who drafted the affidavit as he did not hesitate in proving the applicant to be of criminal mind without adducing any substance in support thereof. Consequently, the Court sought a personal affidavit of the deponent of the counter affidavit (Shailendra Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police/ Circle Officer, Sahawar, District Kasganj), within ten days, as to what was in his possession for making the statement in question and to remain present before the Court on the said date along with the record of the case.   The Court also directed the AGA to remain present before this Court on the next date fixed to explain his conduct of dictating counter affidavit in such an irresponsible manner. Essentially, the Court was dealing with an anticipatory bail plea filed by one Chantara in connection with offences under Sections 498A, 304-B, 201 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act. On September 9, 2020, she was granted interim protection allowing two weeks' time for the State to file a counter affidavit. Now, when the counter affidavit filed by the state was perused by the Court, it noted that the same was filed in a cavalier manner and the same was also bereft of any cogent or coherent factual and legal foundation. The basis of the Court's observation was primarily paragraph 10 of the counter affidavit wherein it was stated that 'लेकिन प्रार्थनी आपराधिक प्रवृति की महिला है' (But the applicant is a woman of criminal nature). The Court noted that the said statement was made without annexing any document. "Remaining reply in the entire counter affidavit rests on denial to each fact mentioned in the anticipatory bail application. Contents of counter affidavit reflects the impetuousness of Government Counsel as well as the deponent where each fact is negated sans due care constricting the role of the applicant as per their whims. This Court cannot turn a blind eye to such imprecise conduct of the deponent as well as learned Government Counsel brought in the counter affidavit," the Court added as it took serious note of the conduct of the AGA as well as the deponent. The Court further observed that the reply appeared to be a transcription of parawise narratives sent by the concerned department, wherein, though most of the paragraphs were sworn to be verified on the basis of the record, however, nothing was brought on record in support thereof. In this regard, the Court made the following strong observation "Since 75th Independence Day Celebrations, Government has marked Azadi-ka-Amrit Mahotsav terming it to be 'Amrit Kaal' with prospective vision in welfare of citizens of the country, however, Police Administration feels more comfortable to remain with colonial structure. Such attitude of functionaries who are instrumental to safeguard the public at large diminishes the ingrained belief over the System and plays a role in impeding the goal set out to ascend to new heights of prosperity." Further noting that the averments in the counter affidavit were made on the basis of skewed information, the Court stressed that it is the prime duty of the A.G.A. also who drafts counter affidavit to acquire the material relying on which the averments being made in the counter affidavit. Consequently, issuing directions to the AGA as well as the deponent, the Court posted the matter for further hearing on February 21, 2023. Advocate Ajay Kumar Vashistha appeared for the applicant. Case title - Chantara vs. State of U.P.    
The court said the disciplinary authority like the medical council has to act with due seriousness and read between the lines before registering a complaint against the doctor.The Karnataka High Court has said the Karnataka Medical Council (KMC) or complainants including the hospitals cannot use provisions of law pertaining to the doctors' professional misconduct as a machinery for recovery of money from them in the guise of disciplinary proceedings. A single judge bench of Justice Krishna S Dixit said, "The provisions of law, Chapter VII of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 read with Section 15 of the Karnataka Medical Registration Act, 1961, cannot be used either by the complainant or by the disciplinary authority i.e., KMC as the machinery for recovery of the money, in the guise of disciplinary proceedings."  The bench made the observation while allowing a petition filed by one Dr Nagesh. The court quashed a complaint filed by Nova Medical Centre Pvt Ltd that accused the doctor of professional misconduct. The bench stressed that in matters of professional misconduct of a doctor, the disciplinary authority like KMC has to act with due seriousness and read between the lines before registering a complaint. It cannot act as a post office which transmits the mail to the addressee, said the court.  It added:  "Setting in motion the disciplinary proceedings against the professionals and more particularly, the doctors, is a more serious matter than setting the criminal law in motion. Onset of such proceedings has deleterious effect on public interest since that would drive the delinquent doctor to 'defensive medicine' to the prejudice of the patient. Therefore, such proceedings cannot be initiated just for an askance. A preliminary enquiry is eminently warranted in cases like this." Case Details: Dr Nagesh in the year 2011 was a visiting doctor with Nova Medical Centre. A patient namely, Jayaprakash, the husband of Soumay P, underwent a serious surgical treatment at the hospital.  Due to some medical complications having arisen, the patient was shifted to Apollo Hospital on 29.03.2011, wherein better medical facilities were available. It is alleged that some ruckus was created by Soumay & her father Puttegowda along with others, leading Dr Nagesh to lodge an FIR on 02.10.2011 with the Kengeri Police, Bengaluru. The patient's wife also filed a police complaint against the doctor for offences punishable u/s 506 (criminal intimidation) & u/s 338 (causing grievous hurt) - the police subsequently filed a cancellation report in the case against Dr Nagesh. Aa per the petition, on 19.10.2011, Soumay accompanied by media persons visited the premises of Nova Medical Centre and coerced the hospital for payment of Rs.40 Lakh towards reimbursement of Apollo Hospital Medical bills. Nova Medical Centre claiming to have paid the same later sent a legal notice asking Dr Nagesh and another doctor to reimburse the same. Dr Nagesh in response denied the claim. Aggravating the matter further, Nova Medical Centre filed a complaint before KMC, alleging professional misconduct against Dr Nagesh. The authority issued a notice to the medico, leading to filing of a case before the High Court Findings: Firstly the court noted that the complaint is not from the side of the aggrieved patient nor on his behalf. There is no explanation whatsoever for the patient's side for not making the complaint, even though they could have lodged an FIR with the Police, it said. It further added, "At least some explanation ought to have been offered by the 2nd Respondent-Hospital in its complaint itself. It is not that such a complaint is not maintainable in law, the definition of misconduct having been widened by the successive amendment to the Rules. Thus, the issue is not as to the maintainability of the complaint but its prima facie consideration-worthiness." Taking into consideration that the police have filed a B report on the complaint lodged by the patient's wife against Dr Nagesh, the bench said the filing of the cancellation report was preceded by a considered expert opinion obtained from Victoria Hospital, Bengaluru regarding the alleged professional deficiency in medical service. The report gave a clean chit to Dr Nagesh saying there was no medical negligence on his part. Taking note of the contents of the legal notice issued to Dr Nagesh by the hospital, the bench said: "The contents of this Notice when construed in the light of other attending material, generates a reasonable impression that the 2nd Respondent – Hospital desired to recover from the Petitioner & 3rd Respondent-Surgeon, a sum of Rs.40 Lakh, contending that on the request of the patient's wife, her father & other family members, this amount was paid towards Apollo Hospital bills of the patient." The court also said the incident in question happened more than a decade ago and that it is not the case of the Medical Council that post incident any objections have been received about the professional conduct of the petitioner.  "The enquiry has been interdicted by a Coordinate Bench of this Court by the interim order, all through. Years have rolled and much water has flowed under the bridges; cause of justice would be served more by the quashing of impugned proceedings than by their continuance in the given circumstances," added the court. While allowing the petition, the court granted liberty to Nova Medical Centre and the patient's wife to pursue civil remedies in accordance with law, if they so choose. Case Title: DR. NAGESH v.

It is high time for all stakeholders who are dealing with motor accident cases to review their mentality in considering the plight of injured victims sympathetically and awarding them compensation, despite violation of Traffic Laws by them, observed the Madras High Court recently. While dealing with the case of a bus driver, who was held liable by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal... It is high time for all stakeholders who are dealing with motor accident cases to review their mentality in considering the plight of injured victims sympathetically and awarding them compensation, despite violation of Traffic Laws by them, observed the Madras High Court recently.  While dealing with the case of a bus driver, who was held liable by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal for accident with a two-wheeler vehicle carrying four persons, a Single Bench of Justice K. Murali Shankar observed,  "It is high time for all stakeholders to review our mind-set that in cases of road accidents involving big and small vehicles, fixing the driver of the big vehicle as tort-feasor, as in majority of cases FIRs came to be registered against the driver of the big vehicle and investigations are being carried out in such a way to make that driver is responsible for the accident.   It is also high time for all who are dealing with motor accident claims to review our mentality in considering the plight of the injured victim or the legal heirs of the deceased victim sympathetically and awarding of compensation in the accidents occurred by violating the Laws and Rules."  Arguments  The Appellant-bus driver in the case at hand had submitted that the two-wheeler carrying four persons was trying to overtake a lorry ahead of them, without noticing his Bus coming in the opposite direction.   He argued that the four boys, one of whom died in the accident, themselves invited the accident due to their own negligence.  He further submitted that after seeing the two-wheeler with four persons coming in the opposite direction in a rash and negligent manner, he stopped the Bus at a distance of 15 feet. However, the two-wheeler rider was unable to control the vehicle and that the accident occurred for the reason that four persons had travelled in the two-wheeler  The Respondent-claimants on the other hand relied on the case of Mohammed Siddique & Anr. v. National Insurance Company Limited & Ors., 2020(1) TN MAC 161 (SC), whereby the Supreme Court had held that the fact that a person was a pillion rider on a motorcycle along with driver and one more person on pillion, may be a violation of the law, but such violation by itself, without anything more, cannot lead to a finding of Contributory Negligence, unless it is established that his very act of riding along with two others, contributed either to the accident or to the impact of the accident upon the victim.  Thus, it was claimed that merely because four boys were riding a motor-cycle will not by itself prove that they were responsible for/ contributed to the accident.  Findings  In his order, the Single Judge expressed his reservations as to the submissions made by the Respondent-claimants. He was of the opinion that two-wheeler vehicles are designed and are meant for travelling of two persons only.   He observed that one aspect of carrying more than 2 persons on a two-wheeler is clear violation of Section 128 of the Motor Vehicles Act.   Another aspect however, the Judge noted, is that carrying more than 2 persons on a two-wheeler inadvertently affects the driving style/ balance of the rider.  The Bench elucidated,  "Suppose if a two wheeler rider takes two grown-up persons or weighty and bulky persons or three grown-up persons in the pillion which is only meant for one person, what would be the effect or impact?   Firstly, rider has to necessarily move forward towards petrol tank so as to give some place to those pillion riders which forces him to sit and ride in an unusual position and posture.   Secondly if 2 or 3 persons are seated in the pillion, then they have to necessarily sit in a cramped or jam-packed position along with rider and the rider will definitely feel or suffer pressure behind, which in turn, will definitely affect or disturb his rhythm of driving and consequently balancing of the vehicle.   Thirdly, if any one of 2 or 3 pillion riders makes any movement usual or unusual, that would make the rider to loose his control over the vehicle. In the above scenario, the movement of rider's legs and hands would get restricted and consequently he can't have full control over the vehicle."  The Bench added,  "Two wheeler is only meant to take a rider and a pillion rider and not more than two at any cost. If the rider takes 2 or 3 persons in his vehicle, then he has to give more acceleration to increase the pulling capacity so as to take more weight. The efforts required from the rider to maintain the acceleration level would affect or divert his attention and concentration."  In this backdrop, the Court has made it clear that if a rider takes 2 persons as pillion riders, that itself would not amount to negligence. For example, if a rider takes his wife and a child or if he takes 2 small boys or lean persons, that by itself would not amount to negligence.   However, if the rider takes 2 or 3 grown-up persons or obese persons, that by itself would amount to negligent driving since the rider can lose his control of the vehicle at any point of time.  "In the case on hand, since four grown-up students had travelled in the two wheeler, I have no hesitation to hold that the rider and all the pillion riders are guilty of negligent riding / travelling," the Single Bench held.  The Bench added that the accident occurred because the rider could not calculate the time required to overtake the lorry, since the natural acceleration of the vehicle must have changed by the weight of four grown-up riders.  It said,  "Since the two wheeler was proceeding on the right side of the lorry and was overtaking the lorry, as alleged by the claimants, two wheeler rider should have seen the Bus coming from the opposite direction. Even after seeing the Bus, he decided to proceed further and in that decision, we can easily infer that he miscalculated the speed of the vehicles, the space and the time taken to cross that space between the two wheeler and the Bus, as he was carrying more weight than the prescribed. Considering the above, this court is of the clear view that not only the two wheeler rider but all the pillion riders are also liable for contributory negligence."  Before parting, the Court expressed that every road user owes a duty of care and caution and is duty bound to drive their vehicles in such a way not to endanger themselves and more importantly not to endanger the pedestrians, cyclists, two wheelers and other vehicle users.  Case Title: Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation v. Marimuthu & Ors.    Read Order   
The Karnataka High Court has said that death of the convict does not discharge his liability from paying fine and compensation imposed by court. It can be recovered from the property which goes to his legal heirs after his death and they are legally liable for payment of fine.  A single judge bench of Justice Shivashankar Amarannavar made the observation while dismissing an appeal filed by one Thotlegowda challenging the order by which he was convicted for the offence punishable under Section 135 and 138 of Indian Electricity Act, 2003 and directed to pay a fine amount of Rs 29,204.  During the pendency of the appeal the accused expired, following which the counsel filed a memo reporting the same.  The court referring to Section 394 of Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with abatement of appeals, said, “An appeal from a sentence of fine will not abate on the death of the appellant.” It added, “In the present case appellant has been sentenced to pay fine only and therefore on the death of the appellant the appeal will not abate.”  Then the court recorded the submission of the counsel for the accused that the legal heirs of the appellant are not interested in making any such application for continuation of appeal.  Thus the bench held “In view of the death of the appellant, the appeal is dismissed. The trial Court is directed to initiate proceedings to recover the fine amount imposed on the accused from his estate which is inherited by the legal heirs of the appellant on his death.”  Case Title: Thotlegowda v. State of Karnataka   Case No: CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 165 OF 2012  Date of order: 13TH DAY OF JANUARY, 2023   Appearance: Advocate Girish B Baladare for petitioner.

The Gujarat High Court Bench comprising Justice Ashutosh Shastri recently dismissed an application seeking cancellation of bail while noting that there was no violation of any bail conditions or misuse of liberty could be made out against the accused persons.  There were 20 FIRs registered against the Accused persons for offences punishable under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471, 114, 34 and 120(B) of the IPC. The main accused person in these FIRs being the Vice-Chairman of the Shree Vikas Cooperative Bank Limited ('Applicant Bank') was accused of having sanctioned different loans for his relatives without proper security even as the relatives failed to repay the loan with interest in due time.  Subsequently, out of 15 Accused persons, 4 persons expired while the remaining Accused were granted anticipatory bail. The Applicant-Bank averred that the main Accused person was bound by the undertaking to deposit an amount of INR 1 lac per month while the other Accused persons were obligated to deposit an amount of INR 25,000 per month during the course of anticipatory bail. The Court while granting bail had stated that the breach of such undertaking would result in the cancellation of bail. Yet, the Accused persons had stopped making any payment to the bank. This compelled the Applicant to file an application at the District Court and before the Co-ordinate Bench of the High Court. However, this application was rejected vide a common order which was being challenged before the instant bench of the Gujarat High Court.  Justice Shastri noted particularly that "without much resistance", the Applicant had "candidly submitted" that under almost similar circumstances, with respect to this offence, the Coordinate Bench of the High Court while examining the case of the other Accused persons had dismissed all applications for cancellation of bail. Per the Co-ordinate Bench, there was no misuse of liberty or breach of bail conditions such that it would invite cancellation of bail.   Further, one of the main Accused persons had repaid the entire amount for which the offence was registered which was not a disputed fact by either party. Hence, there was no reason to cancel his bail. While dismissing the applications, the Bench placed reliance on Myakala Dharmarajam & Ors., v. State of Telangana & Anr (2020) 2 SCC 743 and other cases to discuss the law on the issue of cancellation of bail. It was observed:  "…this Court held that bail can be cancelled where (i) the accused misuses his liberty by indulging in similar criminal activity, (ii) interferes with the course of investigation, (iii) attempts to tamper with evidence or witnesses, (iv) threatens witnesses or indulges in similar activities which would hamper smooth investigation, (v) there is likelihood of his fleeing to another country, (vi) attempts to make himself scarce by going underground or becoming unavailable to the investigating agency, (vii) attempts to place himself beyond the reach of his surety, etc. The above grounds are illustrative and not exhaustive."  Justice Shastri also noted the decision of the Apex Court in X vs State of Telangana and Anr:  "Very cogent and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an order directing the cancellation of the bail, already granted."  Emphasising the absence of grounds for cancellation of bail, the High Court did not interfere with the order of the Co-ordinate Bench of the High Court and dismissed the applications.

The Supreme Court has observed that although order 41 Rule 33 of CPC clothes appellate courts with extraordinary power, it is to be exercised only in exceptional cases. Order 41 Rule 33 of CPC deals with the power of the Court of Appeal to pass an appropriate order in a case regardless of the fact that the appeal is only with respect to a part of the decree or that the appeal is filed... The Supreme Court has observed that although order 41 Rule 33 of CPC clothes appellate courts with extraordinary power, it is to be exercised only in exceptional cases.  Order 41 Rule 33 of CPC deals with the power of the Court of Appeal to pass an appropriate order in a case regardless of the fact that the appeal is only with respect to a part of the decree or that the appeal is filed only by some of the parties. In other words, the Appellate Court can pass an order as it deems it fit regardless of the scope of the appeal. The provision reads as follows :  "The Appellate Court shall have power to pass any decree and make any order which ought to have been passed or made and to pass or make such further or other decree or order as the case may require, and this power may be exercised by the Court notwithstanding that the appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although such respondents or parties may not have filed any appeal or objection and may, where there have been decrees in cross-suits or where two or more decrees are passed in one suit, be exercised in respect of all or any of the decrees, although an appeal may not have been filed against such decrees: Provided that the Appellate Court shall not make any order under section 35A, in pursuance of any objection on which the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has omitted or refused to make such order."   The bench of Justices KM Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy rendered this observation while considering an SLP assailing High Court's order by which the High Court had stayed the final order of dismissal of an employee till the disposal of the criminal case. Although the order of dismissal was not specifically before challenge before the division bench of the High Court, it stayed the dismissal order invoking powers under Order 41 Rule 33. Disapproving this approach, the Supreme Court said :,  "Order 41 Rule 33 no doubt clothes the appellate court with an extraordinary power, which however is a rare jurisdiction. It is to reach justice in the special facts of a case. It is not an ordinary rule to be applied across the board in all the appeals. In fact, the principle is interalia no doubt that even if there is no appeal by any of the parties in the proceedings, an order can be passed in his favour in the appeal carried by the other side. Any order which ought to have been passed can be passed. In this case, there is no order against the appellant(s) by the learned Single Judge. The order of dismissal was not specifically the subject matter of challenge as noticed. We do not think in the facts of this case, that it is a fit case where the High Court could have supported the directions with reference to Order 41 Rule 33." In this case, Eastern Coalfields Limited & Ors v Rabindra Kumar Bhart, the respondent ("Rabindra Kumar Bharti") who was employed as a clerk with Eastern Coalfields Limited & Ors was arrested by CBI on August 31, 2015 on the basis of a criminal complaint lodged for demanding bribe to clear retirement formalities.  A case was lodged against the respondent under Section 7 (12) & (13), sub-section 2 read with Section 13(i)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The appellant also passed an order of suspension against the respondent on 3rd August, 2015 which was revoked on 15th September, 2015. On March 20, 2017, the appellant served notice of departmental enquiry which prompted the respondent to move a writ petition.  The High Court on June 29, 2017 granted the appellant liberty to proceed with the departmental enquiry but restrained them from passing any final order without the leave of the Court.  Since the departmental enquiry ended, the appellant approached the High Court seeking leave to pass final orders which resulted in an order being passed by Single Judge on February 10, 2021.  The Single Bench permitted the disciplinary proceedings to attain finality at the hands of the disciplinary authority which resulted in the authority passing an order of dismissing the respondent from service.  Aggrieved, the respondent approached the Division Bench and the Division Bench in the impugned Judgement proceeded to direct for staying the final order of dismissal till the disposal of the criminal case. It was further ordered that the order of the dismissal against the respondent would become operative on the criminal proceeding culminating in an order of conviction. The Division Bench said that it was exercising power of the Court of Appeal provided in Order 41 Rule 33 which deals with Power of Court of Appeal.  Submission Of Counsel  Appearing for the appellant, Advocate Parijat Kishore for Eastern Coalfields contended that Division Bench of the High Court erred in not noticing that principally it was not desirable to delay the departmental proceeding on account of pendency of a criminal case.   Counsel had further argued that the respondent participated in the enquiry and thereafter on the culmination of the enquiry in keeping with the order passed on 29.06.2017 after the judgment of the Single Judge dated 10.02.2021 the order of dismissal came to be passed. The counsel further argued that the order of dismissal was not the subject matter of appeal and that dismissal of the respondent was not challenged before the Division Bench.  It was also contended that a verdict of acquittal in the trial which may occur in the future would not affect the disciplinary proceedings as these proceedings have purport different from the disciplinary proceedings.  Appearing for the respondent, Advocate Mahesh Prasad pointed out that the impugned order does not call for any interference and that the disciplinary proceedings were not conducted in a proper manner.  Reliance was placed by the counsel on Capt. M. Paul Anthony Versus Bharat Gold Mines Limited & Another (1999) 3 SCC 679 to contend that the charges, the witnesses and evidence in the Criminal case and also in the departmental proceedings were the same.  Supreme Court's Analysis  The bench in the judgement authored by Justice KM Joseph to adjudicate on the issue relied on the precedents in State of Rajasthan v. B.K.Meena and Ors (1996) 6 SCC 417, Pandiyan Roadways Corpn. Ltd. v. N. Balakrishnan (2007) 9 SCC 755 and Karnataka Power Transmission Corpn. Ltd. v. C. Nagaraju and Another (2019) 10 SCC 367.   Referring to the judgements and considering that despite of being a criminal case against the respondent, the appellant had also initiated disciplinary proceedings, the bench said,  "It is undoubtedly true that this Court has taken the view that when the charges are identical and gives rise to complicated issues of the fact and law and evidence is the same, it may not be appropriate to proceed simultaneously in disciplinary proceedings, along with the criminal case. The rationale behind the principle largely is that the employee who is facing the disciplinary proceeding would necessarily have to take a stand. This in turn would amount to revealing his defense and therefore prejudice the employee in the criminal proceedings. No doubt, this Court has laid down that it is not an absolute embargo and the principle is one to be applied based on the facts of each case."  The bench while setting aside the High Court's order said,  "we think that High Court may not have been justified in passing the impugned order the result of which is that though the appellant(s) conducted the disciplinary proceeding as permitted by the learned Single Judge and the respondent allegedly participated in it and all that remained was passing of an order by the disciplinary authority and what is more during the pendency of the appeal no doubt the order of the dismissal has been passed, the appellant is forced to retain the respondent and the order is to remain in suspended animation to attain finality only if the criminal case is decided in the future and it ends in the conviction of the respondent. We do not think that the High Court was justified in passing such an order in the facts of this case."  Case Title: Eastern Coalfields Limited & Ors v Rabindra Kumar Bharti | CIVIL APPEAL NO.2794 OF 2022  Coram: Justices KM Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy     
In a recent decision, the Telangana High Court upheld the conviction of a husband under section 498A of Indian Penal Code despite there being contradictions in the dying declarations as there were consistent statements about abuse and cruelty committed on the wife in all the dying declarations. "Both these statements are consistent with regard to the quarrel ensued between the deceased and A1 and that he came in drunken condition, abused her and came upon to beat her. Unable to bear the same, she poured kerosene oil from the stove on her body and set herself ablaze, which is sufficient to attract the ingredients of Section 498-A IPC. Even after removing the exaggerations, the statement of the deceased in Exs.P4 and P11 is consistent with regard to the harassment and cruelty met by her in the hands of A1 which drove her to commit suicide. As such, this Court does not find any illegality or impropriety in the judgment of the trial court in coming to the conclusion about the guilt of the Accused No.1 for the offence under Section 498-A IPC." The appellant herein is accused for burning his wife to death by pouring kerosene on her. The accused was held guilty of cruelty against his wife under Section 498A by the Metropolitan Sessions Judge, Secunderabad and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 1 year and fine of rupees 1000. The appeal was filed against the decision of the trial court.  The wife of the accused/appellant was admitted to the hospital with fatal burn injuries. She had sustained 40% burn injuries. While undergoing treatment, the wife died and the autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was "shock due to burns". Before her death, the wife had given four dying declarations stating the cause of her death.  The appellant contended that the trial court had not considered the conflicting nature of the four dying declarations given by the deceased, each one was an improvement over the other and as consequence the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused.   The deceased had claimed in the first two dying declarations that she poured kerosene on herself and lit fire due to abusive, vulgar and harsh comments used by the accused. But in the later dying declarations, the deceased stated that the accused had poured kerosene and lit fire to her and used to harass her for dowry.  Issue : Whether the conviction of accused for the offence under Section 498A IPC can be set aside due to inconsistencies in dying declarations?  Ruling of the court  Upon analysis of evidence on record, Dr. Justice G. Radha Rani observed that though the subsequent declarations were improvements of each other, one statement was consistent that the accused used to beat the victim after drinking and constantly demand dowry using vulgar and abusive language. Thus, the offence of Section 498A of IPC would be attracted due to consistent statement about harassment and cruelty by husband driving the deceased to commit suicide.  "The presence of A1 was mentioned in the earlier statements made by the declarant and though there were developments in the subsequent statements, the deceased was specific in both Exs.P4 and P11 that A1 tried to beat her and used most vulgar language against her and the conduct of A1 in abusing the deceased would attract the provisions of Section 498-A IPC which would amount to cruelty defined in the Section driving the deceased to commit suicide" The High Court did not find any irregularity in the trial court's findings and the criminal appeal was dismissed.  Case Title: K.RAJKUMAR v. THE STATE OF A.P.    
The Uttarakhand High Court recently ordered a man to pay ₹50K to his pay after finding that he obtained an ex-parte divorce decree by misleading her. The Court further ordered him to deposit ₹50K with the State Legal Services Authority within four weeks. Essentially, the Husband (while living with his wife and keeping her in dark), managed to get an 'ex-parte divorce decree' after obtaining the wife's signature by misrepresenting to her that her signatures are required in relation to some cases. This was done to show before the Court that his wife had been served with divorce proceedings and she 'agreed to them'.  Taking note of the facts of the case, the Bench of Chief Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe opined that the husband, by his conduct, gravely undermined the institution of marriage which is sacrosanct amongst the Hindus. The Court also observed that if he had to obtain a divorce, he should have fairly and squarely separated from his wife before filing the divorce petition, and he should not have been living with her. "However, he continued to live with her as her husband even after filing the divorce petition and obtaining the ex-parte divorce. The only conclusion that we can draw is that the appellant misled his wife into, and contrived to obtain her signatures on the summons and get the Process Server's report to show that she had been served in the divorce proceedings, while she continued to live with the appellant as his wife in complete ignorance of the said developments," the Court further remarked as he imposed 1 total of ₹1 Lakh cost upon him. The case in brief The husband moved the High Court with the instant appeal under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act challenging an order of the Family Court, Kotdwar, Pauri Garhwal passed in August 2022, whereby the Family Court allowed the application filed by the respondent-wife under Section 5 of the Limitation Act as well as a second application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the CPC, setting aside the ex-parte divorce decree. The respondent claimed that when she got to know about her husband's relationship with another woman, she confronted him and that is when he told her that he had already obtained a decree of divorce against her. It is only thereafter, that she moved to the family court seeking to set aside the ex-parte divorce decree. The wife contended that she had not signed the summons (issued by the Court in connection with divorce proceedings) and that her signatures on the summons had been forged by the appellant.  However, the Family Court set aside the ex-parte divorce decree while noting that the signature of the respondent-wife had been obtained by the appellant/husband by misrepresenting to her that her signatures are required in relation to some cases.  Court's observations The Court observed that when the hudband moved the divorce petition on the ground of cruelty/wife's matrimonial misconduct, he was living with the respondent as her husband and he continued to live with her even after filing of the petition.  In view of this, the Court noted that there would have been condonation of the alleged matrimonial misconduct of the respondent, as the parties continued to reside under the same roof as husband and wife, even after the filing of the divorce petition and even after obtaining the ex-parte divorce. Regrding the signature obtained on the summons, the Court observed that the Husband can not get away with his fraudulent conduct by arguing that she herself signed the summons, as the Court noted that even if she did actually sign the summons, he continued to cohabit with his wife by treating his wife all through - before filing the divorce petition; after filing the divorce petition, and; even after obtaining the ex-parte divorce decree. "The only conclusion that we can draw is that the appellant misled his wife into, and contrived to obtain her signatures on the summons and get the Process Server's report to show that she had been served in the divorce proceedings, while she continued to live with the appellant as his wife in complete ignorance of the said developments," the Court further remarked as it dismissed husband's appeal. Case title - Mahendra Prasad Dwivedi v. Lajji Devi [APPEAL FROM ORDER NO. 331 OF 2022]   
Citing technical reasons, the Kerala High Court on Friday quashed the trial court proceedings against Transport Minister of Kerala, Antony Raju in connection with the evidence tampering case against the Minister pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nedumangad, in Thiruvananthapuram.  However, the single bench of Justice Ziyad Rahman clarified that this would not preclude the competent authority or the court concerned from taking up the matter and pursuing the prosecution in compliance with the procedure contemplated under Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure:  “Though, this court interfered in the proceedings for technical reasons, it cannot be ignored that the allegations raised are serious in nature. The materials placed before this Court reveal allegations which are of such nature and gravity that interfere with the judicial functions and thereby polluting the mechanism of administration of justice. Such acts are required to be dealt with strictly with all vigour, and this court expects a positive and effective follow-up action on this from the authorities concerned to ensure that a fair trial in accordance with the law takes place and the culprits are punished adequately.” the court said in its order.   Taking note of the fact that the offences were allegedly committed in 1990, and further delay would defeat the purpose of the proceedings, the court also directed the registry to take appropriate action in this regard under the relevant provisions of the CrPC. Senior Advocate P Vijaya Bhanu, appeared for Antony Raju, the 2nd accused, assisted by Advocates Deepu Thankan, Ummul Fida, Lakshmi Sreedhar, R.Rajanandini Menon, Shahnas K.P and Nikita J. Mendez. Advocate S Rajeev appeared for the the 1st accused in the crime. Advocate B.G.Harindranath appeared for the defacto complainant and Public Prosecutor Vipin Narayan appeared for the state.  The court had previously stayed all further proceedings against Raju in the evidence tampering case on the prima facie finding that the procedure stipulated under Sections 195 and 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been complied with in respect of an offence under Section 193 (Punishment for False Evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. The court had observed that under Section 195(1) CrPC any proceedings related to Section 193 IPC and the conspiracy to conduct the same could only be conducted on the basis of a complaint of the concerned court or the officer authorized by court or a subordinate court. In Raju's case, the court found that this mandatory procedure had not been complied with.   The prosecution case is that Raju while practicing as an advocate conspired in tampering evidence in a case involving an Australian citizen, Andrew Salvatore who was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Salvatore was found in possession of charas which he had concealed in the pocket of his underwear. In the trial against the Australian National, the undergarment was treated as a crucial piece of evidence. Even though Salvatore was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment by the lower court, he was later acquitted by the High Court after the underwear presented as evidence in the trial court was found to be smaller and could not have been worn by the accused at the time of his arrest.  The 1st accused in the case was the court clerk who secured the personal belongings of the accused and the 2nd accused was Raju, who was practicing as a lawyer in Thiruvananthapuram at the time. It is alleged that the 1st and 2nd accused conspired together to secure the release of Salvatore from the High Court by tampering with the crucial piece of evidence.  Even though Salvatore was acquitted by the High Court, the court indicated the possibility of evidence tampering based on which the Vigilance Officer of the court conducted an investigation and submitted his report. An office memorandum was issued to request the Thiruvananthapuram District Court to direct the Sheristadar to give a first information report to the police in this regard. Subsequently, a crime was registered by the police and a final report was submitted. Raju's plea to quash the proceedings against him was allowed on the technical ground that the cognizance taken on the police report was not legally tenable as it was in violation of the procedure mandated in Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with an appeal filed by the widow claiming right over the suit property on the basis of natural succession, held that appellant's husband was not the owner of the suit land on the date of his death, therefore, the question of inheritance of the estate does not arise. It has been held that late Sh. Baldev Singh was not the owner of the suit... Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with an appeal filed by the widow claiming right over the suit property on the basis of natural succession, held that appellant's husband was not the owner of the suit land on the date of his death, therefore, the question of inheritance of the estate does not arise. It has been held that late Sh. Baldev Singh was not the owner of the suit land on the date of his death. Hence, the question of inheritance of the estate does not arise. The bench comprising Justice Anil Kshetarpal was dealing with the case where the original plaintiff filed the instant appeal, assailing the correctness of the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. The plaintiff claimed the suit property based on natural succession, claiming that her late husband owned and possessed the same. She filed a suit against 4 of her sons and subsequent purchasers from her 4 sons. The Court considered the written statement by the defendants which claimed that the husband of the appellant in the Civil Court acknowledged the 4 sons to be the owners in possession of the property resulting in a judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court in their favor. 
The Supreme, recently, observed that once a written statement is filed by the accused under Section 313(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Trial Court marks it as exhibit, such statement must be treated as part of the statement of the accused under Section 313(1) read with Section 313(4) Cr.P.C. "The written statement(under Section 313(5)) has to be considered in the light of the evidence led by the prosecution to appreciate the truthfulness or otherwise of such case and the contents of such statement weighed with the probabilities of the case either in favour of the accused or against him", the Court added.  While dealing with Section 313 Cr.P.C. on the power to examine the accused, a Bench comprising Justice S. Ravindra Bhat and Justice Dipankar Datta noted -  “Indeed, it is optional for the accused to explain the circumstances put to him under section 313, but the safeguard provided by it and the valuable right that it envisions, if availed of or exercised, could prove decisive and have an effect on the final outcome, which would in effect promote utility of the exercise rather than its futility.”  Factual Background In a murder case, the mother of the deceased lodged a report leading to the registration of an F.I.R. under Section 302 and 307 IPC. Subsequently, the accused was arrested. The Trial Court found that the accused had murdered the deceased using a knife and he also attempted to commit murder of three other prosecution witnesses. It held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt; convicted the accused; and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The appeal before the Bombay High Court, Nagur Bench was also dismissed.   Analysis by the Supreme Court Referring to the written statement filed by the accused before the Trial Court in his defence under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the Supreme Court noted that the accused used to go to Katol every 2-3 months to collect rent. During one of his visits to Katol he was threatened by the victim and attacked by the three prosecution witnesses. It appears that he went to lodge a complaint at the police station, which was not received. Citing a catena of judgments on Section 313 Cr.P.C., the Court briefly summarised the settled principles as under -   “a. section 313, Cr. P.C. [clause (b) of sub-section 1] is a valuable safeguard in the trial process for the accused to establish his innocence; b. section 313, which is intended to ensure a direct dialogue between the court and the accused, casts a mandatory duty on the court to question the accused generally on the case for the purpose of enabling him to personally explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him; c. when questioned, the accused may not admit his involvement at all and choose to flatly deny or outrightly repudiate whatever is put to him by the court; d. the accused may even admit or own incriminating circumstances adduced against him to adopt legally recognized defences; e. an accused can make a statement without fear of being cross-examined by the prosecution or the latter having any right to cross-examine him; f. the explanations that an accused may furnish cannot be considered in isolation but has to be considered in conjunction with the evidence adduced by the prosecution and, therefore, no conviction can be premised solely on the basis of the section 313 statement(s); g. statements of the accused in course of examination under section 313, since not on oath, do not constitute evidence under section 3 of the Evidence Act, yet, the answers given are relevant for finding the truth and examining the veracity of the prosecution case; h. statement(s) of the accused cannot be dissected to rely on the inculpatory part and ignore the exculpatory part and has/have to be read in the whole, inter alia, to test the authenticity of the exculpatory nature of admission; and i. if the accused takes a defence and proffers any alternate version of events or interpretation, the court has to carefully analyze and consider his statements; j. any failure to consider the accused’s explanation of incriminating circumstances, in a given case, may vitiate the trial and/or endanger the conviction.” The Court observed that after scanning through the evidence after the prosecution closes its case, the Trial Court ought to trace the incriminating circumstances to prepare a list of questions to be put before the accused to explain any such circumstance in the evidence that could be against them. It noted that prior to the 2009 amendment to Section 313, it was the bounden duty of the court alone to perform the aforesaid task. The amendment contemplated the Trial Court taking assistance of the Public Prosecutor and the Defence Counsel to prepare the questions in order to ensure fair but speedy trials. The Court noted that the reality is far away from the intention of the amendment as -  “more often than not, the time and effort behind such an exercise put in by the trial court does not achieve the desired result. This is because either the accused elects to come forward with evasive denials or answers questions with stereotypes like ‘false’, ‘I don’t know’, ‘incorrect’, etc. Many a time, this does more harm than good to the cause of the accused. For instance, if facts within the special knowledge of the accused are not satisfactorily explained, that could be a factor against the accused. Though such factor by itself is not conclusive of guilt, it becomes relevant while considering the totality of the circumstances.” It suggested that the exercise under Section 313 should be realistic and act as a means in securing the ends of justice. It noted that in the present case, neither the Trial Court nor the High Court looked at the written statement of the accused. The Court found that the Trial Court did not delve into the argument of private defence advanced by the accused, which seemed plausible. It noted that if the accused, a senior citizen, had the intention to murder he would not have attempted to do so with a weapon such as a knife; in broad daylight; and in the presence of witnesses. The Court opined that the accused was entitled to the benefit of Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC, which suggests culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The Apex Court held him to be guilty under Section 304 IPC. Considering that the accused has already undergone 9 years of imprisonment and in his late sixties, he was directed to be released.  At the end, the Court noted that the police should have investigated the injuries suffered by the accused. However it noted that since almost a decade has taken place since the incident took place, direction to investigate the same now would not be fruitful.  Case details : Premchand v. State of Maharashtra|  (SC) 168 | Criminal Appeal No. 211 of 2023| 3rd March, 2023| Justice S. Ravindra Bhat and Justice Dipankar Datta For Appellant(s) Mr. Sudheer Voditel, Adv. Mr. Ravindra Bana, AOR Mr. Simanta Kumar, Adv.  Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 313(5)- Once a written statement is filed by the accused under Section 313(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Trial Court marks it as exhibit, such statement must be treated as part of the statement of the accused under Section 313(1) read with Section 313(4) Cr.P.C - Para 17 Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 313- it is optional for the accused to explain the circumstances put to him under section 313, but the safeguard provided by it and the valuable right that it envisions, if availed of or exercised, could prove decisive and have an effect on the final outcome, which would in effect promote utility of the exercise rather than its futility- Para 16 Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 313-Settled principles summarized - Para 15 Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Section 313 - judicial experience has shown that more often than not, the time and effort behind such an exercise put in by the trial court does not achieve the desired result. This is because either the accused elects to come forward with evasive denials or answers questions with stereotypes like ‘false’, ‘I don’t know’, ‘incorrect’, etc. Many a time, this does more harm than good to the cause of the accused. For instance, if facts within the special knowledge of the accused are not satisfactorily explained, that could be a factor against the accused. Though such factor by itself is not conclusive of guilt, it becomes relevant while considering the totality of the circumstances - Para 16  
Exhausting the alternate remedy is the rule, entertaining a writ petition is an exception.The Madras High Court recently disposed of a writ petition filed by a workman for terminal and pensionary benefits.

The Madras High Court recently disposed of a writ petition filed by a workman for terminal and pensionary benefits. The bench of Justice S.M Subramaniam, the court observed that the petitioner was a workman and retired from service. Hence, he was governed under service conditions and after retirement under the pension scheme and therefore should approach the labour court for appropriate relief to redress his grievances in the manner known to law.  During the course of the hearing the court also discussed the present situation where the litigants directly approach the High Court under article 226 without exhausting the remedies provided under the statutes. The petitioners seek for a direction to direct the respondent to pay entire pensionary and service benefits. However, the High Courts powers are limited in such cases and these leads to multiplicity of proceedings. The court also opined that litigant should not be made to suffer by way of multiplicity of proceedings.  "The justice delivery system should thrive hard to ensure that the aggrieved persons get speedy justice and their genuine grievances are redressed in accordance with law. Contrarily, if they were driven to Court repeatedly and finally their grievances are not addressed or redressed then the faith in the justice delivery system is in peril and therefore, the Courts are expected to be cautious in dealing with the multiplicity of proceedings and the possibility of creating multiplicity of proceedings and to ensure that the issues are decided on merits at the first instance itself. Once the issues are decided and the rights of the parties are crystallized, then all appropriate reliefs can be granted even in a writ petition filed for a direction to consider the representation."  The court also observed that the question is not with respect to maintainability of these writ petitions but with respect to their entertainability. It was further observed that all writ petitions are maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution but its entertainability is to be decided with respect to the rights of the parties or its infringement.  Therefore, the parties must be allowed to exhaust the alternate remedies provided under the statutes and service rules and then if they are further aggrieved, approach court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The courts are expected to adjudicate issues on merits and settle the issues for the purpose of providing complete justice to the parties approaching the Court.   "The power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is to ensure the processes through which the decision is taken by the competent authorities in consonance with the statues and rules in force, but in a decision itself. This being the scope under the Constitution, the high Court need not venture into an adjudication of the disputed facts between the parties, at all circumstances."  In the present case, the petitioner should have approached the competent labour court for computation of benefits or for any other appropriate relief and if the grievance were not redressed, approach the High Court. In such case, the factual findings of the labour court could be of assistance to the High Court in taking an appropriate decision. The court thus gave liberty to the petitioner to approach the Labour Court for appropriate relief.  Case Title: A Pitchaiah v. The Managing Director and Ors  Case No: W.P (MD) No. 6412 of 2022    
In a significant judgment, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Madhya Pradesh High Court to reinstate a resigned woman Additional District Judge, who had raised sexual harassment allegations against a then sitting judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court.The Supreme Court held that her resignation, in the circumstances of the case, cannot be "construed as voluntary" and therefore quashed... In a significant judgment, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Madhya Pradesh High Court to reinstate a resigned woman Additional District Judge, who had raised sexual harassment allegations against a then sitting judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The Supreme Court held that her resignation, in the circumstances of the case, cannot be "construed as voluntary" and therefore quashed the decision of the High Court to accept her resignation. While ordering her reinstatement as an Additional District Judge, the Supreme Court held that she will not be entitled to backwages, but will be entitled to continuity in service with all consequential benefits. The Court was delivering verdict in the the writ petition filed by a woman Additional District Judge (ADJ) seeking to be reinstated on the ground that her resignation was due to coercion. On 01.02.2022, a Bench comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and B.R. Gavai had reserved the judgment.  The Supreme Court had earlier suggested to the Madhya Pradesh High Court to consider reinstating the petitioner. However, the Full Court of the MP HC took a decision that her request cannot be accepted.  Today, Justice Gavai, before pronouncing the judgment, said : "We have not gone into the correctness of the resolution of the Full Court rejecting the representation. We have independently examined the material on record, assessed the transfer orders, the rejection of her representation and whether the resignation can be considered voluntary". Then Justice Gavai read out the operative portion of the judgment: "Writ petition is partly allowed.  We hold and declare that the petitioner's resignation from the post of ADJ cannot be construed to be voluntary and the order dated 17th July, 2014 passed by Respondent No. 2 accepting the resignation of the petitioner is quashed and set aside. The Respondents are directed to reinstate the Petitioner forthwith as ADJ, though the petitioner would not be entitled to back wages, should be entitled to continuity in services with all consequential benefits w.e.f. 15th July, 2014. No order as to cost". Background  The petitioner alleged that hostile transfer orders were passed as she did not act as per the demands of the supervising High Court judge. She complained that was faced with transfer from a Category 'A' city to Category 'C' city and also a Naxal affected area, in violation of the extant transfer policy of the High Court. Since the transfer would have prevented her from being with her daughter who was then appearing for the board exams, she was faced with no option but to resign. Later, she approached the Supreme Court asserting her right to be reinstated.  The petitioner had joined the Madhya Pradesh Higher Judicial Services in 2011. After her training, she was posted as an Additional District Judge. The respondent High Court Judge was in-charge of assessing the work of the petitioner.  After resigning, on 01.08.2014, the petitioner sent a letter to the Chief Justice of India ("CJI"), inter alia, seeking consideration of the hostile circumstances under which she was forced to resign. On 09.08.2014, Chief Justice of MP High Court apprised the CJI, that he had constituted a two-member committee to look into the issue.  The petitioner filed a Writ Petition before the Supreme Court challenging the constitution of the said In-House Committee and the Apex Court held that the Chief Justice of the High Court had exceeded the authority by delving into a more holistic determination than what was prescribed under the "In-House Procedure." Thereafter, the CJI constituted an In-House Committee. In its report dated 02.07.2015, it stated that the material was insufficient to establish the charge of sexual harassment, but ordered not to rely on its findings.  On 04.03.2015, 58 members of the Rajya Sabha gave notice to the Chairperson of a motion for removal of the concerned judge under Article 217(1)(c) read with Article 124(4) of the Constitution of India on grounds of sexual harassment of a woman ADJ; victimisation of the ADJ for not submitting to his demands, by transferring her; misusing position as Administrative Judge of High Court.  Accordingly, the Chairperson of Rajya Sabha set up a Judges Inquiry Committee ("JIC") presided by Justice R. Bhanumathi and comprising the then Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, Manjula Chellur and Senior Advocate, K.K. Venugopal(as he was then). On 15.12.2017, the JIC had submitted its report, wherein, inter alia, it had found the transfer order to be punitive, irregular, unjustified and not in the interest of the administration.  "62.…The transfer committee committed an irregularity on solely relying on the recommendation of District Judge Kamal Singh Thakur and without making any verification or enquiring on the same, was not justified in transferring the complainant in mid-session. Equally unjustifiable was the rejection of her representations. Transfer of the complainant also does not seem to be in the interest of the administration and, in our view, it was punitive."  According to the report, the interference of the respondent Judge with respect to the transfer was improper conduct, but not misbehaviour.   "65. The interference of the respondent judge in transfer of the complainant may be an improper conduct. But the same will not amount to 'misbehavior' within the meaning Article 124 (4) read with Article 217 of the Constitution of the India."  The petitioner, in 2017, made a representation to the MP High Court seeking reinstatement. It was rejected by a Full Court of the High Court. In 2018, she approached the Supreme Court seeking reinstatement and asserted that her resignation was not voluntary. A three-judge bench of the Apex Court asked the Full Court to reconsider their decision. The Full Court decided against reinstating. Again, on 12.02.2020, a bench headed by the then CJI asked the High Court to deliberate and arrive at a settlement. As the High Court, once again, decided not to reinstate, the CJI suggested that the petitioner could be reinstated; sent to another state; not claim any dues; but maintain seniority, which was not agreed upon by the High Court.   Submissions made by Senior Advocate, Ms. Indira Jaising  The petitioner was coerced into resigning.The petitioner was compelled to choose between her duties as a mother and a judicial officer, in derogation of Article 11 of CEDAW.The JIC had concluded that there was insufficient material to hold the respondent Judge guilty, but did not find there was no sexual harassment. The petitioner was transferred from Category 'A' to Category 'C' city; she was transferred in the same year her daughter was in for Class 12, in violation of the extant transfer policy.Her transfer was an act of victimisation for filing complaint alleging sexual harassment. The High Court and the State had tried to build a case of deficiency in performance of duties, but later changed the narrative to state that transfer was due to administrative exigencies.The petitioner was not given a hearing before the Full Court. An order of law can be challenged if it is shown that there is malice in law.The present case is that of constructive discharge, which holds that if an employer commits a breach, the employee can treat this as constructive discharge.  Submissions made by Solicitor General of India(who appeared for the Madhya Pradesh High Court)  The petitioner had never challenged the transfer order.The petitioner did not challenge the findings of JIC, which indicated that there was no signs of sexual harassment. In determining the transfer order, the JIC had exceeded its scope of inquiry.Irregular transfer in itself does not indicate that the petitioner was coerced to resign.Petitioner's resignation was based on impulsive reaction and would not meet the 'reasonable person' test. Plea of coercion needs to be pleaded, asserted and established, which the petitioner could not establish. Labour law doctrines cannot be applied to judicial officers. Petitioner was not the only judicial officer who was transferred mid-term.Coercion is to be proved and therefore cannot be decided in a Writ Petition.To unsettle findings of JIC and Full Court a higher threshold of proof needs to be met.The allegations were made after considerable delay.The Supreme Court has limited scope to review decision of Full Court.  Rebuttal Arguments put forth by Ms. Jaising  The petitioner had pursued her legal remedy in a bonafide manner - first before the JIC, then the Supreme Court. The transfer is bad in law.The petitioner was not required to show her intentions to resign. On the contrary, the burden was on the employer to justify the transfer, which was not met in the present case. The other judicial officers transferred were not similarly situated.JIC had the jurisdiction to make recommendations.The respondents had stereotyped the petitioner by calling her emotional.    [Case Title: X v. Registrar General And Anr. W.P. (C) No. 1137 of 2018]   Case no.|date: WP(C)1137 OF 2018 | 10 Feb 2022 Coram : Justices L. Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai Counsel: Sr. Adv Indira Jaising for petitioner, SG Tushar Mehta for respondents Head Notes  Practice and Procedure - In some High Courts, a practice is followed, that whenever a Judicial Officer having good track record tenders his/her resignation, an attempt is made by the Senior Judges of the High Court to counsel and persuade him/her to withdraw the resignation. Valuable time and money is spent on training of a Judicial Officer. Losing a good Judicial Officer without counselling him/her and without giving him/her an opportunity to introspect and re­think, will not be in the interest of either the Judicial Officer or the Judiciary - It will be in the interest of judiciary that such a practice is followed by all the High Courts. (Para 86) Constitution of India, 1950- Article 32 and 226 - Judicial Review- The scope of judicial review of a decision of the Full Court of a High Court is extremely narrow and we cannot sit in an appeal over the decision of the Full Court of a High Court. (Para 29) Constitution of India, 1950- Article 12- While exercising its functions on the administrative side, the High Court would also be a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. (Para 39) Doctrine of legitimate expectation - Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right - The failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary - The requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non­-arbitrariness, which is a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision making process. Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable or legitimate in the context is a question of fact in each case. Whenever the question arises, it is to be determined not according to the claimant's perception but in larger public interest wherein other more important considerations may outweigh, what would otherwise have been the legitimate expectation of the claimant - A bona fide decision of the public authority reached in this manner would satisfy the requirement of non­-arbitrariness and withstand judicial scrutiny. (Para 40) Constitution of India, 1950- Article 32 and 226 - Judicial Review- The principle of fairness has an important place in the law of judicial review and that unfairness in the purported exercise of power can be such that it is abuse or excess of power. The court should interfere where discretionary power is not exercised reasonably and in good faith. (Para 40) Transfer Guidelines/Policy of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh - Transfer Policy may not be enforceable in law, but when the Transfer Policy has been framed by the MP High Court for administration of the District Judiciary, every Judicial Officer will have a legitimate expectation that such a Policy should be given due weightage, when the cases of Judicial Officers for transfer are being considered. (Para 41) Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 14 - There is a presumption of validity of the State action and the burden is on the person who alleges violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India to prove the assertion - Where no plausible reason or principle is indicated nor is it discernible and the impugned State action appears to be arbitrary, the initial burden to prove the arbitrariness is discharged, thereby shifting onus on the State to justify its action as fair and reasonable. If the State is unable to produce material to justify its action as fair and reasonable, the burden on the person alleging arbitrariness must be held to be discharged. (Para 55) Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 32, 226 and 14 - Judicial Review - Arbitrariness - The limited scope of judicial review is only to satisfy that the State action is not vitiated by the vice of arbitrariness and no more - It is not for the courts to recast the policy or to substitute it with another which is considered to be more appropriate - The attack on the ground of arbitrariness is successfully repelled by showing that the act which was done, was fair and reasonable in the facts and circumstances of the case. (Para 55) Words and Phrases- "Legal malice" or "malice in law" - State is under the obligation to act fairly without ill will or malice — in fact or in law. "Legal malice" or "malice in law" means something done without lawful excuse. It is an act done wrongfully and wilfully without reasonable or probable cause, and not necessarily an act done from ill feeling and spite. Where malice is attributed to the State, it can never be a case of malice or spite on the part of the State. It would mean exercise of statutory power for "purposes foreign to those for which it is in law intended". It means conscious violation of the law to the prejudice of another, a depraved inclination on the part of the authority to disregard the rights of others. (Para 58) Service Law - Transfer - Normally an order of transfer, which is an incident of service should not be interfered with, unless it is found that the same is mala fide - Mala fide is of two kinds — one 'malice in fact' and the second 'malice in law'. When an order is not based on any factor germane for passing an order of transfer and based on an irrelevant ground, such an order would not be sustainable in law. (61) Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 14 - Non- consideration of the relevant material and consideration of the extraneous material would come into the realm of irrationality. An action which is arbitrary, irrational and unreasonable would be hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. (Para 66) Law of Precedents - A decision is an authority only for what it actually decides. Every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts, proved or assumed to be proved. The generality of the expressions found there, is not intended to be exposition of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. (Para 93) Law of Precedents - The ratio decidendi is a rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and circumstances of a case and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar. - One additional or different fact can make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts.

The Supreme Court has delivered a notable judgment laying down the principles for repatriation of prisoners as per the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003.The Court discussed the issue whether the sentence imposed by a foreign court on an Indian convict, who has been repatriated to India, can be higher than the sentence for a similar offence in India. The Court held that the duration of... The Supreme Court has delivered a notable judgment laying down the principles for repatriation of prisoners as per the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003. The Court discussed the issue whether the sentence imposed by a foreign court on an Indian convict, who has been repatriated to India, can be higher than the sentence for a similar offence in India. The Court held that the duration of the sentence will be governed by the agreement of transfer between the foreign country and India. The Indian Government can modify the sentence of the foreign court only if such sentence is "incompatible with Indian law". However, the Court added that merely because the foreign court's sentence is higher than that under the Indian law, it does not become "incompatible with Indian law". "Incompatibility" herein would signify being contrary to the fundamental laws of India.  A Bench comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and B.R. Gavai allowed a petition filed by the Central Government assailing the order passed by the Bombay High Court, which had allowed the Writ Petition to reduce the sentence imposed by the Supreme Court of Mauritius on the respondent on the ground that there is an incompatibility between the sentence imposed by the foreign court and a sentence that would have been imposed on the respondent if a similar offence would have been committed in India.  Factual Background  The Supreme Court of Mauritius had convicted the respondent under Section 30(1)(f)(II), 47(2) and 5(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act for possession of 152.8 grams of heroin and sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of 26 years. Thereafter, on 04.03.2016 he was transferred to India under the provisions of the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003 ("Repatriation Act"). The respondent made a representation under Section 13(6) of the Act for reduction of sentence to 10 years as per the terms of Section 21(b) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1994 requesting to take into account the term of sentence already undergone by him in Mauritius. The Central Government vide order dated 03.12.2018 agreed to deduct the period spent in remand but by a separate order rejected the plea to reduce the sentence to 10 years. The order of rejection was challenged before the Bombay High Court, which was allowed on 02.05.2019.  In the present case, the respondent had travelled twice to Mauritius in the guise of doing business in scrap metal. On his third visit, he was found to be in possession of heroin. The Supreme Court of Mauritius had considered the mitigating circumstances before determining his sentence. While applying for the repatriation he had vouched by way of affidavit that he would abide by the terms and conditions of the sentence. Later, upon arrival in India, he had submitted the representation seeking reduction in sentence.  Contentions raised by the Central Government  Additional Solicitor General, Ms. Madhvi Divan appearing for the Central Government submitted that as per the statement of object and reasons of the Repatriation Act, the receiving State was obligated to respect the duration of a sentence determined by the transferring State. Ms. Divan relied upon Article 8 of the agreement between the Governments of Indian and Mauritius to argue that India is bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the transferring State and the discretion under Section 13(6) of the Act to adapt the sentence of imprisonment could be exercised only if it was incompatible with the Indian Law, which she urged was not the case. Emphasising the undertaking submitted by the respondent, Ms. Divan averred that he ought to abide by the sentence imposed by the Supreme Court of Mauritius. She further asserted that the decision to not reduce the sentence of the respondent is prompted by foreign policy which should not be lightly interfered with by judicial review, which would otherwise weaken the bilateral ties.  Contentions raised by the respondent  Senior Advocate, Mr. A.M. Dhar appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that no cogent reasons were provided by the Government while rejecting the representation for reduction of sentence. It was further contended that the Government on several occasions reduced sentences of prisons repatriated to India. To bolster his arguments, Mr. Dhar referred to a judgment of the Bombay High Court wherein the sentence was reduced from 30 years to 20 years, which he was informed during the course of the arguments was pending before the Apex Court. It was argued that for possession of intermediate quantities of drugs the maximum sentence was 10 years under Section 21(b) of the NDPS Act and therefore, the sentence imposed for a term of 26 years was incompatible with Indian law.  Analysis by the Supreme Court  A document titled "Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative", Bringing them Home - Repatriation of Indian Nationals from Foreign Prisons: A Barrier Analysis, 2017 which referred to 'Guidelines for the Transfer of Sentenced Persons under the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003' issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India on 10.08.2015 under the Repatriation Act, 2003 was placed before the Court by the Central Government. The Court observed that as per the guidelines, in case of adaptation of sentence of prisoners convicted on charge of drug trafficking reference is to be made to Narcotics Bureau of India to assess the proposed repatriation and probabilities of future indulgence in similar activities. Before repatriation the prisoner is to be informed about the quantum of sentence they are to undergo in India and the repatriation takes place only when the persons give their consent to such quantum of punishment. The Court noted that the respondent had indeed submitted an undertaking regarding the same on 19.10.2015.  Objective of the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003 Considering that the detention of foreign prisoners was a matter of concern, the Repatriation of Prisoners Act., 2003 was enacted in consonance with the bilateral treaties empowering the Government of India to transfer foreign convicts and also to seek transfer of Indian convicts from other countries. The objective behind such transfer was to allow the convicts to be near their families and to provide a better atmosphere to explore the possibility of social rehabilitation. The salient feature of this Act is that the enforcement of the sentence is to be governed by the law of the receiving State, but it would be bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence determined by the transferring State.  Principles Culled Out by the Supreme Court On a combined reading of Section 12 and 13 of the Act and Article 8 of the Agreement, the Supreme Court culled out the following principles -  "A. Any request for transfer of a prisoner from a contracting State to India shall be subject to the terms and conditions as stated in the agreement between a contracting State and Government of India. B. The duration of imprisonment shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions referred to in Section 12 (1) of the 2003 Act, meaning thereby that the acceptance of transfer of a prisoner shall be subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement between the two countries with respect to the transfer of prisoners. To make it further clear, the sentence imposed by the transferring State shall be binding on the receiving State i.e., India.  C. On acceptance of the request for transfer of an Indian prisoner convicted and sentenced in a contracting State, a warrant shall be issued for detention of the prisoner in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the 2003 Act in the form prescribed.  D. The warrant which is to be issued has to provide for the nature and duration of imprisonment of prison in accordance with the terms and conditions as mentioned in Section 12(1) of the Act, that is, as agreed between the two contracting States.  E. The imprisonment of the transferred prisoner shall be in accordance with the warrant.  F. The Government is empowered to adapt the sentence to that provided for a similar offence had that offence been committed in India. This can be done only in a situation where the Government is satisfied that the sentence of the imprisonment is incompatible with Indian law as to its nature, duration or both.  G. In the event that the Government is considering a request for adaptation, it has to make sure that the adapted sentence corresponds to the sentence imposed by the contracting state, as far as possible."  In view of the said principles, the Court opined that the sentence imposed by the Supreme Court of Mauritius was binding in India. A warrant of detention was issued which categorically mentioned that the sentence to be undergone was a term of 26 years. It was asserted by the Court that the question of adaptation would arise only when the Central Government is of the opinion that the sentence imposed in Mauritius is incompatible with the Indian Law. It was clarified by the Court that the reference to Indian law is not restricted to the provisions of the NDPS Act and the 'incompatibility' herein would signify being contrary to the fundamental laws of India. It was further added -  "Even in cases where adaptation is being considered by the Central Government, it does not necessarily have to adapt the sentence to be exactly in the nature and duration of imprisonment provided for in the similar offence in India. In this circumstance as well, the Central Government has to make sure that the sentence is made compatible with Indian law corresponding to the nature and duration of the sentence imposed by the Supreme Court of Mauritius, as far as possible."  The Court upheld the order passed by the Central Government, acknowledging that its decision to reject the scaling down of sentence from 26 years to 10 years was in consonance with the provisions of the Repatriation Act and the agreement between India and Mauritius.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently decreed a divorce plea filed by a man on account of the desertion and cruelty meted out to him by his wife, who filed false and frivolous cases against him. The bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Nidhi Gupta also granted permanent alimony of a sum of Rupees eighteen lacs to the wife as full and final settlement while noting that he Husband had already paid Rs. 23 lacs to the wife as maintenance during the litigation.  "Before parting, even though the parties have lived together in matrimonial home only for nine months, and even though there is no child from their wedlock, and even though during this litigation admittedly the appellant has already paid Rs. 23 lacs to the respondent as maintenance yet, we deem it fit to grant her permanent alimony of a sum of Rs. 18,00,000/- (Rupees eighteen lacs only) as full and final settlement," the Court ordered (emphasis supplied).   The case in brief The Husband/appellant moved a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 before the family court seeking dissolution of his marriage with the respondent on the ground of cruelty and desertion, the same was dismissed by the Additional District Judge, Patiala in May 2017. Challenging the same, he moved to the High Court. He submitted before the High Court that he got married to the respondent/wife in Novemebr 2012 and after marriage, they cohabited together as husband and wife only for 9 months (in total) and no child was born of this wedlock.   In his plea, the Husband claimed that his wife was dominating and disrespectful to him and his family and that she picked up quarrel for no reasons. It was further alleged that she frequently behaved offensively and arrogantly using bad language. To substantiate his case further, it was submitted that his wife left him in September 2013 without any reasonable cause and she took away all her dowry articles including the ones given to her by the appellant's parents and she did not join the appellant's company thereafter, accordingly it was pleaded that the respondent had deserted the appellant.  Reagrding the allegations of cruelty, it was the submission of the husband that his wife had filed innumerable false complaints against the appellant and his family and also Not only filed false complaints before the Army Wives Welfare Association. On the other hand, the wife denied all the allegations and stated that in fact she had been deserted by her husband. She also claimed that her husband used to torture her and made illegal demand of dowry and would beat her mercilessly and never paid any maintenance to her. Court's observations Finding faults with the observations and the order of the family Court, the High Court, at the outset, noted that the wife had levelled the most objectionable allegations against the appellant and his family (which were not substantiated) including the imputations made against her father-in-law stating that he used to behave inappropriately towards her. "Admittedly in this case, the respondent has unequivocally admitted in her cross-examination that her complaint against her father in law alleging inappropriate behaviour was found to be false by the police, and therefore he was not challaned. However, the learned Court below has not dealt with this aspect at all," the Court remarked. Further, the Court took into account the fact that the family court had not factored in certain important facts of the case that showed that the wife had actually meted out cruelty to her husband and had voluntarily deserted him. "In our view, the conduct of the parties in the present case evidences that there are irreconcilable differences between the parties, rendering the marriage, as of today, a mere legal fiction. It is not in dispute that the parties are residing separately since 2013. Even mediation attempts between the parties have remained unsuccessful," the Court remarked as it concluded that with a view to do complete justice, and put an end to the agony of the parties, it was requried to allow the instant appeal. Consequently, the appeal was allowed and the impugned order passed by the Additional District Judge, Patiala was set aside; the petition for divorce filed by the husband under Sections 13(ia) and (ib) of the Act was decreed and the marriage solemnized between the parties was dissolved by a decree of divorce.

The Gauhati High Court recently held that missing person cases would not come within the ambit of a habeas corpus petition (without strong suspicion of illegal detention), but such cases are required to be registered under the regular provisions of the Indian Penal Code. The Bench of Justice Kalyan Rai Surana was hearing a habeas corpus plea filed by one Mamoni Kakoty praying for a direction to recover her son, namely, Bhaskar Jyoti Kakoty who had gone missing since September 2016. Cas in brief  The petitioner submitted that her missing son was working as a Manager of a private company and simultaneously carrying on his own business of carrying foodgrains to godowns of Food Corporation of India in the State of Manipur. On 04.09.2016, she submitted, her son had gone out for business and never returned. Thereafter, an FIR was lodged in the matter on the next dat, however, in October 2018, a report was submitted by the Golaghat Police that the matter was referred to CID Branch but the missing person could not be traced out. Against this backdrop, it was submitted that even after 5 years have gone by and that the writ petition was pending for more than three years, but except for submitting status reports, the State Police could do nothing and was clueless about the missing person. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that it was the responsibility of the Government to look after the security of its citizens and as the State could not provide security to her son and therefore, the State was duty-bound to pay compensation. It was also submitted that he may be under detention of Manipur extremists. The State, on the other hand, submitted that compensation can be granted only if the right to life protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India was violated by the State or its employees and also argued that public law remedy was not available to direct the State to pay compensation if a person goes missing out of his own volition Court's observations  Adverting to the facts of the case, the Court noted that there was no material on record to suggest that the son of the petitioner had gone missing after any action taken by the State Administration including Police, Para-military and Armed Forces.  The Court also took into account the fact that there was no material to show that the missing person had any threat perception from any militant or extremist groups and the State Police had never been called upon to provide any police protection to the missing person.  Therefore, the Court ruled that there was no material to show that the son of the petitioner had gone missing because of any negligence on part of the Police of State Administration. Against the backdrop, the Court referred to the case of Selvaraj vs. The State, H.C.P. 2309/2016, to observe that in that case, the Madras HC had held that a habeas corpus petition would not be maintainable in cases of missing persons and that it would only be maintainable only if the personal life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 is infringed by State or by any private individual. Further, the Court stressed that the Constitutional Courts across the country have held that establishing a ground of illegal detention and a strong suspicion about any such illegal detention is a condition precedent for moving a habeas corpus petition.  Thus, the Court further held that the legal proposition would be that the Constitutional Courts would not entertain habeas corpus petitions where there is no allegation of illegal detention or suspicion regarding illegal detention.  Lastly, dismissing the instant habeas corpus plea, the Court remarked thus: "As noted in this case, no apprehension of the kidnapping of illegal detention was made when the FIR had been lodged and at no point of time till date, any witness examined by the police so far had expressed their apprehension that the son of the petitioner was kidnapped by any person including extremists. Accordingly, there being no iota of doubt that the son of the petitioner had suffered any illegal detention, this habeas corpus petition stands dismissed." However, the Court did advise the petitioner to approach a competent Court of law to seek monetary compensation, the claim for which, the court directed, shall be decided in its own merit without being influenced by any observations made in the instant case.

The Supreme Court observed that there is a fundamental flaw in the policy of granting licence on the First Come First Serve basis.It is the solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non-­discriminatory method is adopted, whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own land, or alienation of property, the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed.In this case,... The Supreme Court observed that there is a fundamental flaw in the policy of granting licence on the First Come First Serve basis. It is the solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non-­discriminatory method is adopted, whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own land, or alienation of property, the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed. In this case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that the policy adopted by the State authorities for the grant of licence on the principle of First Come First Serve basis for the Scheme of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 cannot be held to be fair, reasonable and transparent method. The court observed that it led to an unholy race amongst the applicants in achieving their goal of obtaining grant of licence. Before the Apex Court, some of the parties whose licence were cancelled due to this High court judgment, contended that the policy for grant of licence on First Come First Serve basis was a long standing practice followed by the authorities and the licence was to be granted to the incumbent of its own land in terms of the parameters which have been laid down under the policy.  The court found that there is no such consistent practice as alleged of First Come First Serve basis for allotment of licence available under the entire Scheme placed on record and secondly, from where this principle has been borrowed is alien to the statute and also the policy pursuant to which the process was initiated for allotment of licences to the prospective applicants. Therefore, the court observed that the principle of First Come First Serve basis which has been adopted by the State Respondents in the  facts of the instant case is neither held to be rational nor in public interest and is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court said: 36. That apart, there is a fundamental flaw in the policy of the State of First Come First Serve basis as it involves an element of pure chance or accident and it indeed has inherent in­built implications and this factor cannot be ruled out as we have gone through the record, any person who has an access to the power corridors will be made available with an information from the Government records and before there could be a public notice accessible to the people at large, the interested person may submit his application, as happened in the instant case, and become entitled to stand first included in queue to have a better claim, at  the same time it is the solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non-­discriminatory method is adopted, whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own land, or alienation of property and it is imperative and of paramount consideration that every action of the State should always be in public interest. Observing thus, the bench upheld the High Court judgment.  Case no. and Date: CA 6471 OF 2021 | 27 October 2021 Coram: Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that in the event of the death of the victim, the statement made by her/his to any living person becomes relevant and admissible in evidence under Section 32 (1) of the Indian Evidence Act if the same relates to cause of her/his death.  The bench of Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Umesh Chandra Sharma further clarified that under Indian Law, it is not necessary that the person who made any declaration was actually expecting an assault that would kill him  With this, the bench upheld the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to 3 accused who kidnapped and murdered 2 boys, who were called by them to Agra on the pretext of providing them jobs.  From a perusal of the facts and the evidence brought in the case, the Court held that it was established by the prosecution that the accused had mens-rea to kidnap and abduct the deceased persons for obtaining a ransom, and for this purpose, first of all, they prepared a plan and in furtherance of the plan, the accused Pawan Mishra called the boys for employment purposes and when they came to Agra they were killed and thereafter buried.  The case in brief  Accused Pawan Mishra asked the First Informant (his uncle) to send his nephew/deceased (Amar @ Jeevan Sharma) to Agra where he would be provided with a Job. The deceased went to Agra with his friend (Victor) on June 12, 2005. After 2-3 days, Amar informed the informant on the phone that no arrangement for a job/service was there. Upon knowing this, the first informant had asked him to return.  Now, on June 15, 2005, Pawan Mishra (accused) informed the informant that the boys had been sent back by train, however, when the boys did not reach on June 16, 2005, then the informant contacted Mishra (Accused) on his mobile phone and that is when he told him that he had abducted the boys and that they would be only returned once the ransom is paid.   Pursuant to the registration of the FIR, the accused was arrested and he confessed that since he was in the need of money for repurchasing his paternal house, which was sold away earlier by his uncle, he hatched a plan to ask for ransom from the first informant after kidnapping Amar and his friend Victor.  On his pointing, two other accused persons Dinesh Sahu and Kripal Sahu were also arrested and the three accused, thereafter, took the police to the place of occurrence where the dead bodies of the deceased persons were recovered along with the Shovels/Hoes, which were used in digging and burying the two dead bodies; Jeevan and Victor.  Following the trial, the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment after they were found guilty of committing the offence under sections 302, 364A, and 201 IPC. Challenging the judgment, all three accused moved to the High Court.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court rejected the argument of the counsel for the defence that the dead bodies were not identified. Essentially, the defence counsel argued that since the dead bodies were in such a state that no person could have recognized them and it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt that these two dead bodies were of Amar @ Jeewan Sharma and Victor @ Potan  The Court observed that the dead bodies were recovered upon the pointing of accused persons, especially on the pointing of the accused Pawan Mishra, who had called the deceased to Agra for giving them employment.  The Court also noted that during the cross-examination, no question was raised with regard to the identity of the dead bodies, therefore, this argument can't be raised in the appeal.  Further, the Court observed that the conversation between the informant and the deceased (Jeevan alias Amar Sharma) with regard to their reaching Agra for employment and with regard to the fact that the latter was received by the accused Pawan Mishra, and that both the deceased boys stayed in the hotel arranged by the accused and that the accused demanded of ransom everything is part of the same transaction and thus, the same would be relevant and admissible in evidence under Section 6 of The Indian Evidence Act.  The Court further opined that the conversation of the deceased Jeevan alias Amar to the informant while coming from Devghar and also from Agra to the informant at Devghar is also relevant and admissible in evidence under Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act.  In this regard, the Court was of the view that the information given by the deceased persons before their death to the informant was admissible in evidence against the accused persons under Section 32 (1) of the Indian Evidence Act as the same would be termed as their dying declaration and it was immaterial that they were not under an expectation of death when they made such statements to the informant.  The Court further noted that since it was established that deceased persons were in the company of all the three accused persons, therefore, it was the burden of all of them to discharge their burden of proof under section 106 of The Indian Evidence Act, however, they failed to give any explanation of the death of the deceased persons.  Taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case and perusing the evidence on record, the Court did not find any illegality with the Court's order as it remarked thus:  "The course of this case began on 11.6.2005 when the deceased commenced their journey and reached Agra on 12.6.2005. Thereafter they ended in the hands of accused persons. In between the chain of all the facts and evidence have been fully connected and established by the prosecution. The chain of circumstantial evidence is intact and established without breaking. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that by proving motive, Mens-rea, demand of ransom and lastly recovery of the dead bodies from the person who had demanded ransom, the prosecution has successfully proved the case beyond all reasonable doubt against the accused persons. It is established that except the accused persons none else would have committed the murder and have buried both the deceased persons under the earth at the place of occurrence. Therefore, we find no infirmity in the appreciation of evidence in connection with conclusion drawn by the trial court."  Case title - Pawan Mishra v.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently upheld lower court's decision dismissing the execution petition of decree holder-wife as unsatisfied, due to the fact that she could not bring on record the properties or assets owned by the judgement-debtor/husband. The Court noted that the husband was not the owner of the properties whose list was furnished to the Executing Court and so the same cannot be attached.  The bench comprising Justice Alka Sarin further added that even before this Court, the counsel for the decree-holder/wife has not been able to show anything that links the ownership of the properties with her husband.  The court was dealing with a case where the parties got divorce and court awarded permanent alimony and maintenance of Rs.60 lakhs to the wife. Wife filed an execution petition for its recovery and the execution was sent for attachment of the properties of the husband. In aftermath, third party objections were filed contending that the properties are not owned by the husband. Due to this, the court dismissed the execution petition as unsatisfied.  After considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the court noted that the husband lives in the United Kingdom and from the record available, he has no property in his name in India. It remarked that the travails of a decree-holder commence after he has obtained a decree in his favour and in the present case wife is still to recover the permanent alimony and maintenance awarded to her in 2014. The Court said it can sympathize with her for the delay but it finds no illegality in the judgement of the Civil Court at Balachaur or the Family Court, Panchkula.  The court dismissed the revision petition with liberty to approach the Court with a fresh execution petition once the relevant details are available with her.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that a wife cannot be denied maintenance on the grounds of being well-educated and that a husband is legally and morally responsible to look after his wife and children The Bench of Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj observed thus in a petition filed by a husband challenging an order of the Principal Judge (Family Court), directing him to pay monthly maintenance of Rs 2,500 to her wife (from the date of filing of Section 125 CrPC application by the wife) and thereafter, Rs 3,600/- per month. It was the submission of the Husband that the wife was never satisfied with her marriage she deserted him of her own. He submitted that in view of Section 125(4) CrPC, as the wife had herself left the matrimonial home without any rhyme and reason, she was not entitled to any maintenance. It was further submitted that the respondent-wife is well educated has a Masters' degree in Hindi and her father is working as a Clerk with a practicing Lawyer and the petitioner/husband is getting a meager salary of Rs.4,000/- per month thus, the maintenance granted by the Family Court deserves to be set aside. The Court, in its order, observed that there was nothing on record showing that the respondent-wife had deserted the petitioner without any rhyme and reason. The Court also discarded the argument of the Husband that since the respondent-wife is well educated and has done her MA in Hindi and thus, she is not entitled to the maintenance "The petitioner is an able-bodied man and as per the law settled by Hon'ble Supreme Court in plethora of judgments, the husband is legally and morally responsible to look after his wife and children...The provisions of Section 125 Cr.P.C. are there to prevent the destitution and vagrancy." Consequently, weighing the facts and circumstances of the case on the anvil of law settled, the Court found that the maintenance granted to the wife in view of the income of the petitioner was reasonable and did not suffer from any illegality and thus, the plea was dismissed.

The Gujarat High Court is set to examine whether the action of Schools sending reminders to parents for non-payment of fees amounts to an offence under Section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.The provision provides punishment for cruelty to child, which may lead to physical or "mental suffering".Justice Bhargav Karia has issued notice on a Special... The Gujarat High Court is set to examine whether the action of Schools sending reminders to parents for non-payment of fees amounts to an offence under Section 75 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The provision provides punishment for cruelty to child, which may lead to physical or "mental suffering". Justice Bhargav Karia has issued notice on a Special Civil Application filed by the Federation of Self-Financed Schools against an order issued by the Collector and District Magistrate of Surat, stating that harassment of school students for non payment of fees is a gross violation of Section 75 of the JJ Act. During the hearing, Assistant Government Pleader Dhawan Jayswal informed the Court that the order was issued consequent to a meeting held by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights upon the complaint received from the parents that their children are being harassed by the respective schools for non payment of fees. The Commission had summoned the Collector and directed him to take appropriate action in the matter.  Accordingly, the impugned order cautioned: "Without clear direction from a competent court, no school to do anything that will affect education of the child. Noncompliance of this direction shall be considered a violation of section 13(1) of the Right to Education (Act)."   It was directed: "Therefore, all the private school authorities are to deal with fee related issues with the parents and not the students and prevent fee related harassment amongst school students."  The Petitioner-schools contested that mere reminder sent to parents for non-payment of fees could not amount to offence under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act. Because of the order of the Collector, any complaint filed by the parents would be registered under Section 75 of the Act by the police. It was further submitted that the Collector was acting without jurisdiction and authority of law.   The Bench observed that the Petitioner-schools had "made out a very good prima facie case for granting ad-interim relief", since the Collector seemed to have passed the order without jurisdiction or authority of law.  Accordingly, the High Court stayed the impugned order and also issued notice to the newly joined Respondent party i.e., the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

The Allahabad High Court recently directed the Uttar Pradesh Government to grant a minimum pay (at par with regular employees) to 4 IVth class contractual employees who are working with U.P. State Legal Services Authority since 2005. This order came from the bench of Justice Alok Mathur which relied upon the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of State of Punjab Vs. Jagjeet Singh (2017) 1 SCC 148 where it was observed that the employees, who are continuously discharging duties commensurate with regularly appointed persons, are also entitled to be paid the same wages in accordance with the provisions of 'equal pay for equal work'. "...the petitioners have been working for a substantially longer length of time and are getting only Rs.7500/- per month which admittedly is below the minimum wages fixed by the State Government and accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners are also entitled to being granted a minimum of pay scale as is being granted to regular employees as the same services are being rendered by them," the court observed in its order. Essentially, the Court was dealing with a writ plea moved by 4 contractual employees attached to the High Court Legal Services Sub Committee, Lucknow and who were appointed to the posts of Peon and Clerk in the year 2005. They were being made a sum of Rs. 5K per month, recently, the amount was increased to Rs. 7.5K. Earlier, the petitioners had moved to the High Court in 2015 seeking a direction to the Government to increase their pay, however, the same was disposed of by the High Court in 2018 directing the respondents to decide the representation of the petitioner. The said representation was dismissed by the authorities and even, their case was not considered for a grant of a minimum of the pay scale, therefore, the petitioners moved to the High Court with the instant plea seeking a grant of a minimum of the pay scale. However, relying upon the decision of the Apex Court in the case of State of Punjab v. Jagjeet Singh, and considering the fact that the petitioners have been working for a substantially longer length of time and are getting only Rs.7500/- per month, the Court directed the state government to pass fresh orders granting a minimum of the pay scale to the petitioners, within four weeks.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a case related to primary teacher recruitment and directed the central agency to submit their report in a closed envelope on June 15. Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay was apprised by the petitioner that former state minister and IPS officer Upendra Nath Biswas had named one Chandan Mondal of Bagda, North 24 Parganas for allegedly giving jobs of primary school teachers in lieu of money. Incidentally, Upendra Nath Biswas is a former additional director of the CBI. It was further alleged that Mondal is hands-in-glove with Ministers of the Education Department of Government of West Bengal. Ordering for a CBI probe, the Court underscored,  "Serious allegation by one responsible person, who was none other than the Ex-Additional Director of CBI and a Cabinet Minister of the State Government in the first five years of the Government, has come before this court which is serious corrupt practice. I hold this aspect is to be thoroughly investigated by the CBI and such investigation is required to be started forthwith. The Police of this State is otherwise very efficient but controlled by some persons in power and cannot act freely which is common knowledge and without showing any disrespect to the Police authority I hold that CBI is the appropriate authority to investigate the matter." It was further stated that the CBI shall have every power to call and interrogate the accused Chandan Mondal and the former State minister Upendra Nath Biswas was also instructed to fully cooperate with the CBI to expose the scam of selling jobs as has been alleged. Accordingly, the CBI was directed to submit a status report in a sealed cover on the next date of hearing which is slated to take place on June 15.  Case Title: Soumen Nandy v. The State of West Bengal & Ors    
In an appeal from a motor accident claim, the Allahabad High Court recently underscored the importance of ensuring the claimant(s) received the compensation they were entitled to in the event of a dispute between the owner of the vehicle that caused the accident and the insurer. To this end, the Bench of Justices Dr Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajit Singh emphasised that even the heirs of the claimant, once their status as heirs was established, would be entitled to claim compensation due to the original claimant.  Relying on Surpal Singh Ladhubha Gohil v Raliyatbahen Mohanbhai Savlia it was stated, "The facts go to show that the claimant was under the constant treatment of doctors till the claimant survived therefore, it can safely be held that the accident caused lot of trauma both to the claimant as well his heirs. There is nexus between the death of the deceased and accidental injury. There is sufficient evidence to the effect that death of the deceased was due to development which took place due to resultant multiple injuries caused by the accident which would show that injuries were the root cause of the death. Therefore, heirs are entitled to compensation." What transpired in the case  After the original claimant met with a motor accident in February 2005, he approached the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal in September. Summons was accordingly in 2007 issued to the owner of the vehicle (though this was subsequently disputed).   The Insurance Company filed one reply presented in 2009 denying liability after a request for an adjournment was made in 2008. In 2010, the Insurance Company was allowed to contest the proceedings. After this, the Tribunal passed an award in favour of the claimant. Since the owner did not present himself, the Tribunal concluded that the vehicle could not have neem insured on the date of the accident.  Thereafter, the claimant took out execution proceedings against the owner in 2011. Notice was issued and unresponded to. After two years, when the tribunal passed an attachment warrant against him, the owner presented himself and challenged the Tribunal's award as ex-parte. He filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13 of C.P.C., contending that he was never served with any summons/notice and came to know of the proceedings only later. His vehicle was insured with respondent no 2 (Insurance Company) who would be liable to satisfy the decree, he averred. The Tribunal thereafter stayed the award and no further steps were taken. The claimant died during the pendency of the proceedings and his heirs argued that his death resulted from the injuries sustained in the accident. The Award was then set aside on the ground of the original claimant's demise.   What the Court held  The High Court reasoned that the decree could have been set aside in part, with the dispute between the owner of the vehicle and the insurance company decided as between themselves. The claimants ought to have been allowed their rightful compensation, the Court concluded.  Therefore, the Court allowed the heirs of the claimant compensation of Rs 24 Lakhs along with interest amounting to 7.5% per annum from the date of the filing of the claim petition till the date of actual deposit.  Importantly, the Court said –  "The Tribunals in the State shall follow the direction of this Court as herein afore mentioned as far as disbursement is concerned, it should look into the condition of the litigant and the pendency of the matter… The same is to be applied looking to the facts of each case."  The Bench its gratitude for the assistance of the Counsel who appeared in the case.   Observations  "It can be safely culled out from the record that the main purpose for filing the application under Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. by the owner was to see that the liability is mulcted on the Insurance Company and not on them. The decree could have been set aside in part namely qua issue of liability as it was a award which could be set aside in part there was definitely severable decree"  The Court also narrated the facts of in Surpal Singh Ladhubha Gohil v Raliyatbahen Mohanbhai Savlia to demonstrate that heirs could be allowed the compensation that was due to the original claimants  "The death of original claimant during pendency of claim petition his legal heirs being brought on record and where the Tribunal held that claimants would not be entitled to compensation since they have no right to continue the proceedings on the death of original claimant, since action for personal injury abates with the death of original claimant. The question whether maxim "actio personalis moritur cum persona" namely that personal right of action abates with the death of the person, can be imported to a social welfare legislation so as to deny the benefits to legal heirs of a deceased claimant, to the advantage of a wrong doer the High Court held that strict application of maxim "actio personlis mortiur cum persona" cannot be imported to defeat the purpose and object of a social welfare legislation like Motor Vehicles Act. Once the status of claimants as legal heirs or legal representatives is conceded and acknowledged, to deny benefit of compensation to them on the ground that injury was personal to the claimant, it will be giving a premium to the wrong doer and it would defeat the very purpose and object of beneficial piece legislation. The question whether injury was personal or otherwise is of no significance so far as wrong doer is concerned and he is obliged to make good the loss sustained by injured, even after death of injured, claim petition does not abate and right to sue survives to his heirs and legal representatives." The Court again held -  "In our case Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. could not have been made applicable by setting aside the entire decree instead partial modification 14 of decree even in execution could have been resorted to which would have served the purpose of all the litigating parties. Even if during the execution, proceedings it was brought to the notice of the executing court that the vehicle was insured, the liability could have been fastened on the contesting insurance company with whom the vehicle was insured."  Speaking of what would have been the outcome had the award not been set aside, the Bench said -   "In the event the decree would have been executed, of course, the claimants would have got the benefit of the decretal amount during the life-time of the original claimant who breathed his last in 2013. Had an illegal stay would not have been granted, what would have been the position. The Tribunal instead of granting stay could have directed the Insurance Company to verify the documents and deposited the amount as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 more particularly Section 169 read with Section 170 and further Section 174 of the Act. 33. It is settled position of law that the award of the Claims Tribunal shall be paid by owner or driver of the vehicle in the accident and they would be indemnified by insurer or by all or any of them, as the case may be."  The Bench therefore concluded that the Tribunal acted in a very casual manner by not deciding the matter for a period of five years namely 2013 till 2018. It said - "The Tribunal committed a mistake rather irregularity by setting aside the award and decree in totality under Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. after the death of the original claimant without impleading the legal heirs. The Tribunal further committed an error which is apparent on the face of record by re-deciding the compensation. The only new circumstances were death of the injured claimant and production of documents so as to prove that the vehicle was insured and there was no breach of policy condition. 37. The awards passed by of the Claims Tribunal must be in conformity with the provisions of Section 166 read with Section 169 and 170 of the Act will also go to show that the Tribunal has erred in exercising power under Order 9 Rule 13 of C.P.C. The decisions impugned are not in conformity with the object of the Act. The findings are perverse and do not satisfy the legislative intent of the Act. The claimants were under the impression that the lis was between the owner and the Insurance Company and had the owner deposited the entire amount which he was supposed to, he could have recovered the same from the Insurance Company; if he had proved that there was no breach of policy condition. The primary duty to satisfy the decree is on the driver and owner of the offending vehicle. The only basis of challenge was that the owner had all the documents and therefore, it was the liability of the Insurance Company to indemnify as per the Act….

CASE: (Deceased) Satish Chand Sharma And 3 Other v. Manoj And Another COUNSEL: Advocates Abhishek, Umesh Kumar Singh for appellant, Advocate Nishant Mehrotra for Respondent    
The Delhi High Court has observed that a momentary lapse on the part of the candidate must not be met with such a severe punitive action which would cause grave and irreparable prejudice and affect the candidate's future perversely. Justice Sanjeev Narula granted relief to a candidate namely Samriddhi Khandelwal by directing National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) to allow her to join the counselling on the basis of her results of the online invigilated or remote proctored NIFT Entrance Exam, 2022.  The said Exam was divided into two parts – a written exam which was held on 06th February and a Situation Test which was to be held from 2nd April 2022 onwards.  The petitioner candidate had appeared for the online exam on 06th February 2022 from her residence, as per specifications mentioned in the Admit Card, complying with Rules and Regulations for Online Invigilated / Remote Proctored NIFT Entrance Exam for Admissions 2022.  She was then declared as "disqualified" in respect of the CAT exam, in the declaration of result dated 9th March, 2022. Aggrieved by the same, the petition was filed seeking directions on NIFT to publish and declare her in pursuance of the entrance exam for admission to bachelor of design course. The plea also sought directions on NIFT to allow her to participate in Situation Test (second round). While the Court allowed the plea, it was of the view that it cannot enter the mind of the Petitioner to establish her bona fides, however, it was satisfied that she had come with clean hands and had repeatedly admitted to the lapse on her part while clicking photos and uploading the PDFs in the said exam.  "The Court is also mindful of the fact that due to the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, the structure of examinations has certainly undergone a monumental change, rendering both students and educational institutions alike, struggling to cope-up with the challenges posed by a complete shift to the virtual world. The consequences of such an upheaval have deep implications, and the instant petition is just one of the many issues that have been flagged as a by-product of this shift," the Court observed.  It was the case of NIFT that the Petitioner was rightly disqualified as she had disclosed the identity of the institute from which she was taking coaching for the exam, which was clearly visible from the PDF answer sheets uploaded by her to the online portal. Therefore, NIFT had argued that it was a case of her identity being disclosed in the examination, which was in violation of Rule 12 printed on the Admit Card.  In this backdrop, the Court was of the view: "Though the afore-noted pictures reveal the name of the coaching institute, however, they do not indicate the identity of the candidate. This identification mark does not seem to violate condition no. 12 of the Admit Card, and for this reason alone, the Court is inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to the Petitioner. Surely, the identification of a candidate can also be revealed by giving a hint or a suggestion, but that can occur if there is a nexus between the candidate and the examiner. However, such a case is not canvassed by the Respondent." The Court also noted that there was no allegation against the Petitioner candidate of any malpractice or use of unfair means and that she was required to analyze the question and draw her answers on the questions-cum-answer sheets.  The Court also noted that the petitioner was then required to click pictures thereof, stitch them together into PDF files, and upload them on the portal, all within the stipulated time.  "It cannot be forgotten that the Petitioner is just a teenager, and given the enormity of appearing for an entrance exam which decides her career, coupled with the obligations of a new-format online system, it could have taken a toll on the Petitioner who was in a pinch of time. It is therefore plausible that due to paucity of time, towards the fag end of the exam, the Petitioner panicked and did not crop or properly click photographs of her answer sheets and hurriedly uploaded the same to conform with the deadline," it said.  The Court added "In view of the foregoing, the Court is of the view that a momentary lapse on the part of the candidate must not be met with such a severe punitive action, which would cause grave and irreparable prejudice and affect the Petitioner's future perversely." The plea was accordingly allowed.  Case Title: SAMRIDDHI KHANDELWAL v. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FASHION TECHNOLOGY    
The Kerala High Court on Thursday held that where a person had not been a judicial officer either on the date of submission of application for appointment as the District Judge, or on the date of his appointment as such, and he had only been a Munsiff-Magistrate trainee, the same would not be a bar for his appointment to the post of District Judge.  Justice Anu Sivaraman passed the above order in a petition challenging the appointment of A.V. Telles (3rd respondent), on the ground that he had been undergoing Munsiff-Magistrate training at the Kerala Judicial Academy, and observed,  "a reading of the provisions of the Kerala Judicial Service Rules would make it amply clear that the initial induction in the post of Munsiff-Magistrate is as pre-induction trainees and that Ext.P6 is an order deputing the incumbents whose names are contained in Ext.P5 list for the pre-induction training. Since the Special Rules specifically provide for a pre-induction training and a later appointment as Munsiff-Magistrate after completion of the period of training, the contention of the petitioner that the 3rd respondent stood appointed as Munsiff-Magistrate and was therefore a judicial officer cannot be accepted". The Court further observed in this case that the,  "3rd respondent had sought the permission of the High Court to be relieved from the training and such request was also granted by the High Court and informed to the Government. The Government had passed Ext.P7 order re-appointing the 3rd respondent who had a lien in the post of Assistant Public Prosecutor Grade I, as such".  The facts of the case reveals that the petitioner, Unnikrishnan V.V., and the 3rd respondent in the case, A.V. Telles, both of whom had been Additional Public Prosecutors at the time, had applied to the post of District and Sessions Judge. Petitioner had applied under the category No.4 (NCA vacancy of Scheduled Tribe) as well as category No.6 (regular vacancies), while the 3rd respondent had applied only under the category no. 4 vacancy.  Thereafter, the 3rd respondent Telles, was appointed as the Munsiff-Magistrate, in pursuance of an application submitted by him. He was thus, undergoing training for the same, at the Kerala Judicial Academy with effect from April 4, 2022. Meanwhile, he had also appeared in the preliminary and mains examinations, as well as the interview for appointment to the post of District and Sessions Judge, after which a Selection list was issued featuring his name as serial no.1 in the category 4, while the petitioner was serial no. 2.  It is the petitioner's case that the 3rd respondent, who had ceased to be a practising lawyer on his appointment as Munsiff-Magistrate as on the date of his appointment as District and Sessions Judge is not entitled to such appointment and the petitioner was thus liable to be appointed in his stead. He relied upon the Apex Court decision in Dheeraj Mor v. High Court of Delhi (2020) in this regard.  On the other hand, it was contended by the 2nd respondent, High Court of Kerala, that both the petitioner as well as the 3rd respondent had been Assistant Public Prosecutors while applying for the post of the District and Sessions Judge, and they were both included in the select list for appointment to the same under the recruitment No.4/21 (NCA vacancy - ST). It was submitted that the candidate retains a lien over the post in the parent cadre under Rule 8 of Part II KS & SSR, as the appointment that was made was by transfer.  It was also argued by the counsels that the 3rd respondent was never appointed as Munsiff-Magistrate and that he was only appointed as a Munsiff-Magistrate Trainee for the pre-induction training as provided in the Kerala Judicial Service Rules. "...The provisions of the Kerala Judicial Service Rules are perfectly clear that the training offered is pre-induction training and that only on successful completion of training can a person be appointed as a Judicial Magistrate in the Kerala Judicial Service", it was added. It was further argued that the 3rd respondent had sought the permission of the High Court for being relieved from the training for Munsiff-Magistrate and to allow him to rejoin the post of Assistant Public Prosecutor Grade I, which request was permitted by the administrative committee.  It was pointed out by the counsels for the respondents that the Government had also passed an order subsequently, permitting the 3rd respondent to rejoin duty as Assistant Public Prosecutor, and that it was during that time that he had been appointed as the District and Sessions Judge. It was contended that since the 3rd respondent had been a practising lawyer at the time of submission of his application as well, there was no irregularity in his appointment. The Court in this case discerned that the question before it was as to whether the 3rd respondent had any ineligibility for appointment. The Court in this case perused the Kerala Judicial Service Rules, and ascertained that the method of appointment of Munsiff-Magistrate is by direct recruitment and transfer, particularly, Rules 5, 6, 7, and 8.  "It is, therefore, clear from a reading of the provisions that appointment by transfer to the post of Munsiff-Magistrates is also to be made from a list prepared by the High Court in accordance with Rule 7. Thereafter, a training is prescribed by Rule 8. It is evident from the provisions of the Rules that what is contemplated is a pre-induction training. The Rules also provided that all first appointments by direct recruitment or transfer shall be made from the list prepared in accordance with Rule 7", it explained.  The Court found that in this case, the 3rd respondent had been selected for appointment as Munsiff-Magistrate by transfer, and he had been deputed for training. It took specific note that the 3rd respondent participated in the selection process for the post of District Judge, on having obtained the prior permission of the High Court. The resignation he subsequently tendered was also accepted by the High Court and the Government, and he was appointed as the District Judge only following this.  As regards the finding in the Dheeraj Mor case, the Court observed, that the embargo therein was specifically with respect to the selection of persons who had been appointed as Judicial Officers as District and Sessions Judges in the quota set apart for direct appointment from the Bar.  Distinguishing this from the facts of the present case, the Court discerned that  "that the 3rd respondent was a judicial officer neither on the date of submission of his application for appointment as District Judge nor on the date of his appointment as such. Moreover, he was only a trainee Munsiff-Magistrate from 4.4.2022. In the above factual situation, I am of the opinion that the prayers as sought for are not liable to be granted".  The writ petition was thus dismissed.  Case Title: Mr. Unnikrishnan V.V. v. State of Kerala & Ors.   
Pulling up Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) over its selection process for upcoming Asian Games, the Delhi High Court has observed that a National Sports Federation should prioritize identifying and fostering best talent in the country without being muddled by hyper-technicality and personal vendettas against any candidate.  Observing that a sportsperson belongs to the stadium and not in courts corridors, Justice Gaurang Kanth said that no one who aims to bring laurels to their motherland should be subjected to mental agony by the federations and its officials.  The court was hearing the petitions moved by three equestrians against the process of selecting candidates for the 19th Asian Games to be held from September 23 to October 8. The court observed that the EFI failed to produce any documentary evidence to demonstrate that the impugned selection criteria was issued by a duly constituted Selection Committee in accordance with Article 15 of its statute.  It also said that the EFI changed the rule of qualifications while the selection process was ongoing and hence denied equal opportunity to all the aspirants of 19th Asian games. “Despite presence of such precautionary provisions, element of biasness and conflict of interest remains a major challenge in running of National Federation in Indian sports as can be seen in the present matter. The Vice President (Finance) of EFI, despite having a major vested interest in the selection process failed to disclose this fact before the Federation or before this Hon‟ble Court for that matter,” the court said.  The court directed the EFI to allow all the equestrians who participated in the selection process to attend the coaching camps and allow them to participate in Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) competitions in which already selected probables will be participating. “This Court is deeply saddened by the sorry state of affairs and the deplorable condition of professionalism amongst the representatives of the EFI. Instead of spending a considerable amount of energy and funds on prohibiting young sportsmen from entering the list of "probables", the EFI should rather focus on improving its administration and chalking out a strategy to bag as many international laurels as possible,” it said.  Justice Kanth further said that the case seems to have become a “David and Goliath contest” where an organization is using all its might to eliminate certain individual from the competition. “It is a proud moment for every Indian citizen to see our Athletes with Tricolour in their hand. The country recognises the years of hard work and dedication put by each Athlete to reach at that stage. The role of National Federations is to ease the difficulties faced by the Athletes and extend the necessary help to them to enable them to better their performances,” the court said.  Furthermore, it was observed that it is the duty of the National Sports Federations to ensure that the selection process is conducted in a fair and transparent manner and the selection criterion are made known to all stakeholders well in advance. It added that any dilution to this process will not only shatter the dreams of these athletes, but every citizen of the country.  “EFI is directed to allow all the equestrians who participated in either of the Selection Process V-3 or V-5 to attend the coaching camps and participate in the FEI competitions in which already selected “Probables” will be participating,” the court ordered.  Advocates Nikhil Singhvi, Shikhar Kishore, Bilal Ikram, Milind Dixit, Parth Aggarwal, Gautam Narayan and Urvi Mohan appeared for the petitioners.  Advocates Kirtiman Singh, Prateek Dhanda, Waize Ali Noor, Manmeet Kaur Sareen, Vidhi Jain, Madhav Bajaj, Kunjala Bhardwaj and Yash Upadhayay appeared for EFI. CaseTitle: CHIRAG KHANDAL v. EQUESTRIAN FEDERATION OF INDIA & ORS. and other connected matters    
The Kerala High Court recently held that the State Human Rights Commission has jurisdiction to direct payment of compensation for human right violations The Division Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Murali Purushothaman passed the order in a case where a street vendor had been evicted by the Kottayam Municipality in a discriminatory manner, and without issuance of notice.  "The right of the 3rd respondent to carry on vending on street guaranteed by the Constitution is subject to the restrictions imposed by the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994. However, we find that the power of removal of encroachers vested in the Secretary under the Municipality Act is not exercised judicially and reasonably. The 3rd respondent's right to livelihood has been deprived otherwise than in accordance with a just and fair procedure established by law. Consequently, it follows that the Municipality has infringed the fundamental rights of the 3rd respondent under Article 21 of the Constitution", the Court observed.  It went on to add that,  "...the action of the Municipality and its officers in evicting the 3rd respondent has infringed his rights relating to life and equality guaranteed by the Constitution. Violation of rights relating to life and equality guaranteed by the Constitution amounts to violation of human rights".  Brief Facts As per the factual matrix, a street vendor (3rd respondent) had approached the Human Rights Commission, alleging that a sanitation worker from the Municipality had asked him to remove a waste kit placed near his vending place and when the former told that him that he had not kept the same at the place, the worker had verbally abused him. It was further alleged that when he had left the vending place to buy medicine, about 15 employees of the Municipality came in a garbage collection vehicle and took away all the clothes kept by him for sale. He contended before the SHRC that this had affected his source of livelihood, and that he was not in a position to repay the loans, and that he had also sustained a loss of Rs.2,34,000/-.  The Municipality subsequently filed a report before the SHRC stating that the 3rd respondent was summarily evicted pursuant to an order issued by it and in exercise of its powers under Section 367 (3) of the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994 since there were reports regarding obstruction to vehicular and pedestrian traffic due to the street vending, and that the 3rd respondent had occupied 3/4th of the pavement and was littering the area causing blockage of the drain.  Thereafter, the SHRC visited the premises of the Municipality and recorded that only one box and a few items could be seen and no details of the items seized were recorded in the mazhar. It further noted that although there were several street vendors on the road, only the 3rd respondent had been evicted, and that the same was done at the behest of the owner of the hotel near the place where he was vending. The SHRC thus found the said act of the Municipality to be discriminatory, and his eviction from the place where he had been doing business for a quarter century as inhuman and in violation of his human rights and right to life and the directions of the Supreme Court and the Government Policies. It therefore directed the Municipality to pay an amount of Rs.50,000/- as compensation to him and further directed to provide facility to him to re-allocate, once such place was available.  It is the said order that the petitioners had challenged.  Arguments Raised It was contended by the petitioners that there had been no violation of Human Rights in this case, and that the SHRC lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the 3rd respondent. It was submitted that the Municipality could summarily evict the encroachers under Sections 367 (3) and 372 of the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994, and that the order that had been issued was thus lawful. It was further argued that the SHRC could not order payment of compensation, but only make a recommendation to the Authority under Section 18 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  The 3rd respondent on his part, contended that he was entitled for protection from eviction under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 and for re-allocation under the statute. It was further contended that, having subjected to the jurisdiction of SHRC and not having raised the issue of maintainability of the complaint before it at the first instance, the petitioners were estopped from raising any objection as to the maintainability of the complaint as well as the jurisdiction of the SHRC in awarding compensation.  Findings of the Court The Court in this case perused Sections 367 which provides for removal of encroachments, and 372 which provides for instances where the Secretary may remove encroachments without notice. It ascertained that as per Section 367(3), the power vested in the Secretary to summarily evict encroachments is discretionary and shall be exercised judicially and reasonably. "The power of summary eviction shall be exercised by the Secretary in cases of urgency which brooks no delay. In other cases, the Secretary may, by notice, require removal of encroachment. In the light of the fact the 3rd respondent had been engaged in vending at the place for long, notice should have been issued to the 3rd respondent before eviction, so that he could have offered his explanation or could have taken away the articles kept for sale", it observed.  The Court further noted that the 3rd respondent alone had been evicted amongst the persons doing street vending at the same place.  "The Municipality cannot follow pick and choose policy and there cannot be any discrimination in the matter of eviction of street vendors. The action of the Municipality has infringed the fundamental right to equality guaranteed to the 3rd respondent under Article 14 of the Constitution of India", it observed.  The Court thus concluded that the human rights of the 3rd respondent had been violated by the Municipality in this case.  As regards the contention of the petitioners that the SHRC could not order payment of compensation, but only make a recommendation to the authority under Section 18 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, it noted that in State of Kerala & Anr. v. Human Rights Commission & Ors. (2015), a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had observed that when the Human Rights Commission recommends to the concerned Government or Authority to make payment of compensation or damages, it is with the intend to make payment by the said authority. The Court had in the said case, rejected the argument that the Commission lacked the jurisdiction to direct payment of compensation.  "In the light of the said decision, we hold that the Human Rights Commission has jurisdiction to direct payment of compensation to the 3rd respondent for violation of his human rights. We do not find any illegality or irregularity or lack of jurisdiction in Ext. P7 order passed by the Human Rights Commission", the Court observed while dismissing the writ petition.  The petitioners were granted two months' time from the date of the order to make payment of the amount ordered by the SHRC. The petitioners were represented by the Standing Counsels for the Kottayam Municipality Advocates S. Ranjit, Ajit Joy, and Siby Chenappady, as well as Advocate N. Raghuraj. Senior Government Pleader Thushara James, Senior Advocate K. Anand, and Advocates M.S. Amal Dharshan, Kaleeswaram Raj, and A. Aruna appeared on behalf of the respondents.  Case Title: Kottayam Municipality & Anr. v. The Chairperson, Kerala State Human Rights Commission & Ors.   
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that the report of a Government Analyst would become conclusive under Section 25(3) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, only against the person who despite having been provided a copy of the report, has failed to notify his intention to adduce evidence in controversion of the report, within a period of 28 days.  The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the complaint filed by respondent Drugs Inspector against them and the co-accused before the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar, alleging commission of offences under Section 18(a)(i) read with Section 27(d) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.  The petitioner premised his challenge on the ground that the manufacturer had a statutory right to controvert the report of the Government Analyst by adducing evidence but in his case the said right of the petitioners had been violated.  The petitioner contended that the respondent Drugs Inspector had not issued any notice to the petitioners under Section 23 and 25 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act nor a portion of the sample was sent to the petitioners and the impugned complaint had been filed by the respondent Drugs Inspector at a time when there was no time left for the date of expiry of the drug in question and, as such, the petitioners had no opportunity of applying to the Court with a request for retesting.  Perusal of the record revealed that as per the report of the Government Analyst, Chandigarh, the sample of the drug manufactured by the petitioners was found to be of standard quality.   After receipt of the report of the Government Analyst, Chandigarh, the sample was sent for reanalysis to Central Drugs Laboratory , Kolkata , under the directions of the High Court.  Dealing with the question as to whether in such circumstances, when the sample has been tested by the Central Drugs Laboratory, a manufacturer or any other person has a right to seek a direction for reanalysis of the sample, the bench observed that Sub-sec (4) of Section 25 of the Act is amply clear that that once a manufacturer or the person from whom the sample was taken notifies his intention of adducing evidence in controversion of the report of Government Analyst, the sample of the drug has to be sent for test or analysis to the Central Drugs Laboratory and once such report is received, the same becomes conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein.  Answering the difficulty that arises in cases where the sample has already been analyzed by the Central Drugs Laboratory, the bench explained that the provision begins with the expression "unless the sample has already been tested or analyzed in the Central Drugs Laboratory" means that if the sample has already been tested or analyzed in the Central Drugs Laboratory, the same cannot be sent for re-analysis again to the same laboratory or to any other laboratory.  Dealing with the other contention of the petitioner that to whether the right of a person from whom the sample has been collected or of the manufacturer of the drug to adduce evidence in controversion of the report of Central Drugs Laboratory would get defeated and violated once the sample is sent directly for analysis to the said laboratory, the bench observed that it is clear that while a manufacturer has a valuable right of getting the sample re-tested/re-analyzed by the Central Drugs Laboratory so as to adduce evidence in controversion of the report of the Government Analyst but once the sample has been tested by the Central Drugs Laboratory, there is no occasion for sending the sample again for testing to the same laboratory.  Deliberating on the term "Conclusiveness" used in sec 25(3) of the Act the bench explained that the conclusiveness meant in Section 25(3) of the Act has reference to the person referred to in the said sub-section, meaning thereby that the facts stated in the report of the Government Analyst would become conclusive only against the person who despite having been provided a copy of the report, has failed to notify his intention to adduce evidence regarding facts stated therein within a period of 28 days.  "This conclusiveness of the facts stated in the report would not come into play in a case where the manufacturer or any other person has either not been provided the copy of the report or where such manufacturer or person had no occasion to notify his intention to adduce evidence in controversion of the report," said the court.  Applying the said position of law to the instant case the bench recorded that since the manufacturers/petitioners were not provided the copy of the report of the CDL, Kolkata, or if at all the same was provided, the petitioners/manufacturers could not ask for reanalysis of the sample as the same had already been tested by Central Drugs Laboratory. Therefore, the report would not be conclusive against the petitioners and the petitioners would be at liberty to adduce evidence in controversion of the said report before the trial court, underscored the bench.  For the foregoing reasons, the bench found the petition devoid of any merit and accordingly dismissed the same.  Case Title : M/s Swiss Garner Life Sciences & Ors Vs Union of India.        
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that the pendency of prosecution is no bar to an order of preventive detention and an order of preventive detention is also not a bar to prosecution. Discharge or acquittal of a person will not preclude detaining authority from issuing a detention order.The observation was made by a bench of Justice Moksha Khajuria Kazmi ... The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that the pendency of prosecution is no bar to an order of preventive detention and an order of preventive detention is also not a bar to prosecution. Discharge or acquittal of a person will not preclude detaining authority from issuing a detention order. The observation was made by a bench of Justice Moksha Khajuria Kazmi  while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner assailed his order of detention issued by by Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir whereby he was placed under detention in terms of Section (3) of Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 (for short NDPS Act ), and lodged in Central Jail Kote Bhalwal, Jammu.  The petitioner in his plea submitted that he had been falsely implicated in cases alleging offences under the NDPS Act. The petitioner further stated that In both the FIR's he had already been bailed out by the competent court, however,after a gap of about two years and six months, he had again been detained in terms of the impugned detention order on the basis of the material/dossier supplied by SSP Kupwara to the Detaining Authority. The petitioner also argued that there is no material, evidence or document against the detenu as to how and on what material the Detaining Authority had attained satisfaction to pass the detention order.  Perusal of the record revealed that the police had recovered Charas like substance during Naka checking and the detenue was caught with a polythene bag containing 400 gm of Charas for which FIR No's 49 and 56 of the year 2012 and 2019 respectively, under Section 8/20 NDPS Act was registered against the detenue. The record further revealed that despite arrest of the detenu in the aforesaid criminal cases, he had continued to do the same acts and the confidential and credible sources have repeatedly confirmed that the detenue has made drug a sole profession.  Adjudicating upon the matter the bench observed even one prejudicial act can be treated as sufficient for forming requisite satisfaction for detaining a person and the power of preventive detention is a precautionary power exercised in reasonable anticipation. It may or may not relate to an offence and It is not a parallel proceeding. It does not overlap with prosecution even if it relies on certain facts for which prosecution may be launched or may have been launched, the bench underscored.  The bench further recorded,  "An order of preventive detention may be, made before or during prosecution. An order of preventive detention may be made with or without prosecution and in anticipation or after discharge or even acquittal. The pendency of prosecution is no bar to an order of preventive detention and an order of preventive detention is also not a bar to prosecution. Discharge or acquittal of a person will not preclude detaining authority from issuing a detention order" Buttressing the said position of law the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations of supreme court in Hardhan Saha v. State of W.B., (1975) wherein SC observed,  "There is no parallel between prosecution in a Court of law and a detention order under the Act. One is a punitive action and the other is a preventive act. In one, case a person is punished to prove his guilt and the standard is proof beyond reasonable doubt whereas in preventive detention a man is prevented from doing something which it is necessary for reasons mentioned in section 3 of the Act to prevent." The bench further noted that it is not a number of acts that are to be determined for detention of an individual but it is the impact of the act(s) which is material and determinative. In the instant case the acts of detenue relates to drug trafficking, which has posed serious threat, apart from health and welfare of the people, to youth, most particularly unemployed youth, to indulge in such nefarious acts, and accordingly petition merits dismissal, the court concluded. Case Title : Manzoor Ahmad Lone Vs UT of J&K & Ors    
The Allahabad High Court  has held that the Magistrate has the power to enforce an order of maintenance passed under Section 125 Cr.P.C. by issuing a warrant to the Collector to recover the same as arrears of land revenue. The bench of Justice J. J. Munir clarified that if read conjointly,  Section 125(3) and Section 421 give power to the Magistrate to issue a warrant to the Collector for recovering the defaulted maintenance as arrears of land revenue. The case in brief One Usha Devi obtained ex-parte order against the plaintiff (appellant herein) for getting maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar in January 1982. The plaintiff got to know about the ex parte order and thus, he made an application to the Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar seeking to set aside the sale. The same was allowed in May 1982 and the ex parte maintenance order was set aside. In the meantime, the defendant purchased the plaintiff's immovable property in December 1982. Thereafter, the plaintiff's wife applied for the recovery of dues under the ex parte maintenance order.  Now, it was the plaintiff's case that after the maintenance order had been set aside in May 1982, the sale of the plaintiff's property in December 1982 was one made without jurisdiction, as there was no maintenance order in existence then to execute. After his suit was dismissed by the District Judge of Varanasi, he moved to the High Court arguing that it was not open to the Magistrate, who had the execution of the ex parte maintenance order before him, to enforce it by forwarding a recovery certificate to the Collector. As such, it was argued that all proceedings taken by the Revenue Authorities at Varanasi, pursuant to the recovery certificate issued by the Magistrate for enforcement of the ex parte maintenance order, were without jurisdiction. On the other hand, the defendant who brought the property in question argued that there was jurisdiction under the law available to the Magistrate to issue a recovery certificate to the Collector by virtue of the provisions of Section 125(3) CrPC. High Court's order At the outset, the Court conjointly read Sections 125(3) and 421(1) of the CrPC to note that it is open to the Magistrate to enforce an order of maintenance that remains uncomplied with, for every breach of it, by the issue of a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines "It is the discretion of the Magistrate, before whom an application for enforcement of the maintenance order comes up, either to issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by attachment and sale of movables of the defaulter under Section 421(1)(a) of the Code, or to issue a warrant to the Collector, authorizing him to realize the amount as arrears of land revenue. It is open to issue both kind of warrants simultaneously also," the Court remarked. The Court further noted that Sub-Section (3) of Section 421 obliges the Collector, whenever a warrant is issued to him, to recover any amount, that qualifies for a fine, as arrears of land revenue in accordance with the law, treating the warrant to be a recovery certificate issued under the law relating to land revenue recovery. Against this backdrop, the Court rejected the argument of the plaintiff that the Magistrate had no power to issue a warrant to the Collector for the recovery of the amount of maintenance in default as arrears of land revenue. In view of this, the appeal failed and was dismissed with costs. Appearances: Counsel for Appellant :- S.

The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld the conviction of a man for raping a 7 year old girl by observing that mere penetration is sufficient to prove the offence of rape and that presence of injuries on the body of the victim is not necessary. A Bench comprising Justices Bivas Pattanayak and Joymalya Bagchi observed, "It has also been strenuously argued that the allegation of... The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld the conviction of a man for raping a 7 year old girl by observing that mere penetration is sufficient to prove the offence of rape and that presence of injuries on the body of the victim is not necessary.  A Bench comprising Justices Bivas Pattanayak and Joymalya Bagchi observed,  "It has also been strenuously argued that the allegation of rape on a seven year old minor is improbable as no injuries were found on the body of the victim including her private parts. Her hymen was intact. It is trite law mere penetration is sufficient to prove the offence of rape. It is not necessary that penetration must be of such nature that it would cause injuries or rupture the hymen..In the aforesaid factual matrix, it is clear that there was a slight penetration into the private parts of the victim, which though sufficient to constitute rape, did not result in rupture of hymen." Thus, the Bench dismissed the contention of the appellant that allegation of forcible rape on the minor victim is improbable just because there were no injuries found on the private parts of the victim. "Thus, I am of the opinion that the prosecution case has fully been proved beyond doubt and cannot be rendered improbable due to absence of injuries being noted on the body of the victim", the Court opined further.  Background  The instant appeal had been preferred against the judgment passed by the concerned Sessions Court convicting the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section 376(2)(f) (rape) of the IPC and sentencing him to suffer 2 rigorous imprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/. In default, to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for six months more with a further direction that if the fine amount is recovered, 50% of the same shall be paid to the victim. On April 14, 2013, the mother of the minor victim had gone out for work as a domestic help leaving behind her minor daughter aged around 7 years and her one year old son at home. Taking advantage of her absence, the appellant, who is a neighbour, came into the house and raped the minor girl. He had asked the minor to remove her inner garments on the lure of giving her ten rupees. Thereafter, around 2:30 pm when the mother of the victim returned from work, she found the appellant coming out of her house wearing a gamchha.  Upon entering the house she found her minor daughter crying and subsequently  the minor victim had disclosed that the appellant had raped her. Thereafter, a police complaint had been registered against the appellant under Section 376(2)(f) of the IPC.  Observations  Upon perusal of the rival submissions, the Court noted that the evidence of the minor victim had been corroborated by her mother and other local witnesses that the appellant had been seen coming out of the residence of the victim bare-bodied and wearing only a gamchha.  The Court further noted that evidence of a rape victim mist be treated on par with an injured witness. It was further observed that the evidence of the minor victim is reliable and inspires confidence and that there exists no reason as to why the victim would falsely implicate the appellant.  Dismissing the contention that rape is improbable as no injuries were found on the body of the victim including her private parts, the Court underscored,  "Judged from this background it is clear that the victim was a helpless minor girl and unable to resist the sudden attack by the appellant who was a full grown person. Moreover, as soon as the appellant had penetrated his penis into the victim, her mother arrived and he left the spot." Thus, the Court held that the prosecution case has fully been proved beyond doubt and cannot be rendered improbable due to absence of injuries being noted on the body of the victim. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.  Advocate Karabi Roy represented the appellant. Advocate Arani Bhattacharyya was the amicus curiae. The State has been represented by advocates Parthapratim Das and Manasi Roy. Case Title: Manick Sardar v. State of West Bengal

Expressing its concern over the working condition and the atmosphere in the Foreigners' Tribunal, the Gauhati High Court on Thursday directed the Deputy Commissioners across the state of Assam to take immediate steps to ensure decent working conditions in the Tribunals. Importantly, noting that the tribunals' members are required to hear cases and pass orders by sitting on a Sofa as the basic amenities such as a Chair and a Table is not available in those Tribunals, the Bench of Justice Suman Shyam issued the following order: "The Deputy Commissioners of all the districts to take immediate steps to ensure that the minimum infrastructural facilities, so as to ensure a decent working condition in the Foreigner's Tribunal across the State wherever necessary, is put in place without further delay," the Court directed. Even though the Court accepted that upgrading the infrastructure in the existing Tribunals may take some more time due to operational reasons, however, the Court stressed that Tribunal Members can't be made to function even without a proper sitting arrangement  Against this backdrop, the Court observed thus: "If the learned Members of the FTs are discharging their duties on a regular basis, then it would be the responsibility of the State Government to make available to them, the minimum infrastructural facilities so as to ensure that they can function in a manner that is befitting the office held by them." Other submissions made before the Court Standing Counsel, FT, Assam submitted that the Home Secretary, Govt. of Assam has issued necessary notification regarding the constitution of the 3 Members Committee as well as the guidelines and procedures to be followed for entertaining and deciding the complaints received against the members of the FTs.However, it was also submitted that the approval of the Government of India, in the Ministry of Home Affairs, regarding the extension of service of 200 additional FT Members is still awaited, as a result of which, there is some uncertainty in the functioning of those Tribunals.The Amicus Curiae submitted that the Members of the FTs have received their salary for the month of July. With regard to the recruitment of 200 additional FT Members, the Court was apprised that due to non-finalization of the NRC and consequent non-issuance of the NRC rejection slips, the purpose of such recruitment remained unfulfilled, and therefore, they were not assigned any regular work for a long period of time. In this regard, the State Counsel apprised the Court that there was still some uncertainty as to their continuance in office as the State Government would not be in a position to extend their service in the absence of approval from the Government of India. Lastly, adjourning the case for further hearing on October 28, 2021, the Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Home and Political Department, was directed to take necessary follow-up steps for ensuring compliance with the order. Case title - XXX XXX XXX v. In re - The Government of Assam and 3 Anr.  Read Order  
The Karnataka High Court has held that a power of attorney holder of an accused cannot maintain a petition be it under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. or Criminal Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C.  A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna made the observation while dismissing a petition filed by one Samantha Christina Delfina Willis and others who are residing in London and had filed a petition seeking to quash a complaint filed by her husband.  The bench said "I hold that the present petition filed by the power of attorney holder of the accused, without seeking any permission at the hands of this Court, and without even narrating in the petition that he is personally aware of the facts of the case, the writ petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. is per se not maintainable, as the accused cannot be represented by a power of attorney holder and thus, maintain the subject petition."   The court also imposed a cost of Rs.1,00,000 on the petitioners, to be deposited with the High Court Legal Services Authority, within four weeks.   Case details.   The petitioner got married to the complainant husband Syed Ali Hindustani through a website on June 6, 2021. It is alleged that from June 12, 2021, the wife was tortured by the husband/ 5th respondent barely five days after marriage. On July 11, 2021, the wife fled to her ancestral house at Kolkata. On July 17, 2021, the complainant and his parents travelled to Kolkata to persuade her to come back to Bangalore. Not acceding to the request, both the petitioners flew to London, United Kingdom. On November 14, 2021, the petitioners returned to Kolkata to seek annulment of marriage. By then, respondent/ husband had registered the complaint before the Police at Bangalore on November 11, 2021.  It was alleged in the complaint that wife after marriage had taken all the jewellery of his mother stating that she requires them for a photo shoot as she liked ethnic Indian jewels and had not returned the same. Further allegation is that an amount of Rs.7.5 crores was transferred to the account of the 1st petitioner as on deceit she has induced the 5th respondent to shell out with the money on the ground that a property is being purchased in their joint names. The complainant also alleges that the petitioners were not even Muslims and have posed themselves as Muslims but they were in fact Christians.   On the said complaint, the police registered a case under sections 406, 419, 420, 380, 384, 389, 506 read with Section 34 of the IPC.   Petitioners' submissions.   Advocate Ajesh Kumar for the petitioners argued that a pure matrimonial dispute is sought to be given a colour of crime and also the dispute is purely civil in nature. The allegations made in the complaint, even if taken to be true, would not make out an offence against the petitioners. The allegation against petitioner that they have taken away the jewels belonging to the complainant and some money has been transferred from the account of the complainant to the account of the 1st petitioner. These are during subsistence of marriage and, therefore, no criminality can be attached to any of the allegations made in the complaint.   Further, there is no misappropriation of any funds as the property is registered in the names of both the 1st petitioner and the complainant. That none of the ingredients of Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC can even be made in the case at hand as there is no inducement for purchase of property by the 1st petitioner on the complainant and its dishonest misappropriation. He would further submit that there is no inducement inducing the complainant to part with any money with a dishonest intention and, therefore, seek annulment of proceedings.  Respondents' submissions.   Senior advocate Vivek Reddy representing the 5th respondent, refuted the submissions to contend that the writ petition so filed is not even maintainable. Though it is a writ petition invoking Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482. of the Cr.P.C., it is not maintainable, as it is filed by a power of attorney holder and not by the petitioners. He would submit that if the petition itself is not maintainable, none of the grounds urged in the petition can be looked at, as it operates as a threshold bar upon the petitioners to urge any of the contentions.  Further, notwithstanding this, on merits of the matter, the learned senior counsel would further contend that the 1st petitioner lured or induced the complainant to part with all the jewels belonging to his mother on the pretext of a photo shoot and all the jewelry was handed over to the 1st petitioner who has admittedly not returned the same but carried to United Kingdom. In the same way, the 1st petitioner has induced the complainant to part with Rs.7.5 crores sitting in the United Kingdom allegedly towards the payment of the purchase of an apartment.   It was also said the petitioners were guilty of suppression of facts while seeking an interim order at the hands of this Court and sought dismissal of the petition on the aforesaid grounds.  Court findings  On going through the records the bench observed, "The power of attorney appended to the petition is executed at Bangalore, but signed by the executants before the Notary at London. There is no averment in the entire petition that the said power of attorney holder is aware of the facts of the case. There being no averment to the effect that the power of attorney holder has full knowledge of what is being filed and the reason for presenting the petition by the said power of attorney holder. Notwithstanding the fact that it is filed invoking writ jurisdiction of this Court as an amalgam to Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., the writ petition would not become maintainable."   The bench then referred to the judgement of the Delhi High Court in the case of Amrinder Singh V. State Of Nct Of Delhi, where it was held that an accused cannot recourse to a third party, such as a Power of Attorney holder, to represent him in criminal proceedings. It then observed, "On a coalesce of the judgments so rendered by the Constitutional Courts, what can be unmistakably gathered is that the power of attorney holder of an accused cannot maintain a petition be it under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. or Criminal Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C."  As regards suppression of fact, the petitioner was arrested and then released on bail. The bench noted there is no whisper about the afore-narrated facts and events that have been suppressed by the petitioners while filing the present petition.   It said, "Therefore, there can be no doubt that the petitioners are guilty of approaching this Court with unclean hands and such petitions should be thrown to the winds by imposition of exemplary costs."   It added, "If there is no candid disclosure of relevant and material facts or the petitioners are guilty of misleading the Court, the petition is to be dismissed at the threshold without considering the merit of the claim."   Accordingly, it dismissed the petition.

There is nothing which could impinge upon State's power to acquire licenced property in larger public interest.The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently made certain important observations as to the non-applicability of promissory estoppel against government on grant of NOC with respect to land use, vis-a-vis a subsequent acquisition for "public purpose" under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.A Division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli observed,"Once permission... The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently made certain important observations as to the non-applicability of promissory estoppel against government on grant of NOC with respect to land use, vis-a-vis a subsequent acquisition for "public purpose" under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. A Division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli observed, "Once permission is granted/NOC is granted for setting up of college and thereafter, State cannot acquire it for all time to come, this may lead to an anomalous situation which may not be in the larger public interest and would amount to "public interest" making way for "private interest" which is not permissible at any costs/under any circumstances...doctrine of "legitimate expectation" or the principle of "promissory estoppel" can't be pressed into service where the public interest is likely to suffer as against the personal interest of a party." The brief facts of the case are: Petitioners were granted permission to set up a school and the NOC was issued to set up the B.Ed. College by the State Government on a certain piece of land. The state government later acquired the same piece for development of Industrial Model township to be developed as an Integrated complex for industrial, residential, recreational and other public utilities. The petitioners challenged this acquisition by the state government under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The High Court while hearing the case decided as follows:  Grant of NOC/ licence/ CLU does not give the landowner right to set up a plea of "promissory estoppel" against the State  The petitioners contended that state government is barred by the rule of "promissory estoppel" from acquiring the land for which it had issued NOC to them. The bench while rejecting this contention of petitioners observed: "The factum of grant of NOC for establishing the college would not be an impediment for the State Government to acquire the land in accordance with the provisions of the applicable land acquisition act."  The bench held that the grant of NOC/ license/ CLU or any other permission would not give the landowner a right to set up a plea of "promissory estoppel" against the State.  Use of land for development of industrial infrastructure constitutes "public purpose" under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 gives power to the state government to acquire land required for "public purposes", upon satisfaction of certain procedural requirements. The petitioners in the present case contended that the development of Industrial Model township i.e. the purpose for which land was acquired, is not a public purpose. Rejecting this contention of the petitioners, the bench observed that the definition of public purpose is not capable of being given a static and definite definition and that the state is the first judge to decide the "public purpose" for which the land is required to be used, though such decision is subject to judicial scrutiny.   It held that the land in question is required for development of industrial infrastructure which constitutes "public purpose". The bench also observed that since long time has lapsed from the date of acquisition, even if due to change in the planning, if the land in question is sought to be utilised for any other public purpose, there would no impediment for same in view of the settled proposition of law.  The recommendations of the Land Acquisition Collector are not binding on the State   Section 5A of the Act, provides hearing of the objections to the proposed acquisition of land by the Collector. The petitioners contended that recommendations made by the Land Acquisition Collector to exempt land from the acquisition proceedings in the objections heard in present case are binding on the State Government. The court rejected this contention of the petitioners and observed: "Recommendations made by the Land Acquisition Collector to exempt land from the acquisition proceedings or even to acquire the land are not binding on the State except that same have to be considered by the State Government while forming the opinion."  No case of discrimination under Article 14, Constitution of India made out  The bench also rejected the contention of the petitioners that the action of the state government violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India and observed that petitioners have to show that they are identically situated to such persons in whose favour discrimination is being pleaded to prove discrimination on part of the state. Court rejected the argument stating that petitioners have not placed on any material to support its contention of discrimination.   The court also laid emphasis on the fact that when on 26.02.2007, it made an order in favour of the petitioners, granting them interim stay on dispossession [status quo order], the petitioners did not bring to the notice of the court the fact that the land had already vested in the state government by the announcement of the award under section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The court relied on Indore Development Authority v. Union of India, wherein the Apex Court has held that once the possession of the land is taken by the State, person retaining the possession is merely a "trespasser". The court held that the land stood vested when interim stay was granted, and that the petitioners deserves to be non-suited on the ground that the land stands vested in the State.

Emphasizing the duty of the Court to encourage genuine settlement of matrimonial disputes, the Supreme Court set aside conviction of a man under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 ('IPC'). In this case, the husband was convicted under Section 498-A IPC and was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment of three years. Sessions Judge dismissed the appeal filed by him. Partly allowing the Revision Petition, the High Court of Jharkhand taking note of the settlement between the parties, confirmed the conviction under Section 498-A IPC while reducing the sentence to the period of imprisonment already undergone. In appeal before the Apex Court, the issue raised was whether the High Court, even after taking note of the settlement of the parties resolving their marital disputes, has erred in not setting aside the order of conviction altogether? The Apex Court bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath opined that maintaining of conviction of the appellant of the offence under Section 498-A IPC would not be securing the ends of justice. With such conviction being maintained and the appellant losing his job, the family would again land itself in financial distress which may ultimately operate adverse to the harmony and happy conjugal life of the parties, the bench said. Before the Court, both the parties reiterated their stand that they have resolved their disputes and are living together while leading a happy conjugal life. The court, thus, observed: "Taking note of the object of Section 498-A IPC, the expected approach of the High Court in the event of bona fide settlement of disputes had been duly exposited by this Court in the case of B.S. Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and Another: (2003) 4 SCC 675, where this Court has underscored the duty of the Court to encourage the genuine settlement of matrimonial disputes" The court also referred to the judgment in Bitan Sengupta & Anr. v. State of West Bengal & Anr. : (2018) 18 SCC 366. Allowing the appeal, the bench observed: "In the aforesaid view of the matter, and taking note of the terms of settlement as stated in the application moved before the High Court which include the undertaking of the appellant that he would be nominating the respondent No. 2 as the nominee in his service record; and where the parties are said to be leading a happy conjugal life, we are clearly of the view that the High Court should have accepted the settlement and quashed all the proceedings with annulment of the orders against the appellant. The High Court having not done so, we are inclined to adopt this course so as to secure the ends of justice."

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that a heinous crime accused can not complain of the violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India when he himself is not cooperating in the early conclusion of the trial. Denying bail to Suresh Yadav, the prime accused in the 2019 Raebareli-Aditya Murder Case, the bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh further opined thus: "When the accused are not cooperating in the trial and the accused-applicant is accused of heinous offence of a gruesome murder of a young man in a most dastardly manner, this Court does not find that it is fit case where the accused-applicant should be enlarged on bail." The case in brief Allegations against the accused applicant Yadav and other co-accused are that in October 2019, when the deceased along with his friends went to have a meal at Somu Dhaba (owned by Yadav), some altercation took place and the accused-applicant and other co-accused badly assaulted the deceased and threw his dead body at some distance to give the incident as an accident.  It was alleged that CCTV footage of the Somu Dhaba and the area recorded between 10 PM to 1 AM were deleted. The accused persons including the applicant were booked under Sections 302, 201, 147, 148, 149, 323, 120-B, 216 IPC. Now, the accused Yadav moved to the High Court by arguing that even after a lapse of more than two years since the date of the incident, charges have not been framed and the trial has not commenced. Submissions advanced His counsel further submitted that there is no likelihood of the trial commencing in near future. Accused-applicant can not be kept under trial for an indefinite period and therefore, he should be released on bail. It was contended that the case/trial was committed to the court of sessions in utter violation of Section 209 read with Section 207 CrPC and therefore, it was submitted that the trial can not proceed if there had been a violation of Section 209 read with Section 207 CrPC. Lastly, a violation of the fundamental rights of the accused-applicant guaranteed under Article 21 read with Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India was also alleged by the Counsel for the accused-applicant. On the other hand, the state argued that there is sufficient evidence available against the accused-applicant and other co-accused and that the accused-applicant is the main architect of the crime. It was further informed to the Court that the accused have been given all the papers, which have been filed by the police, and therefore, there is no violation of Section 207 or 209 CrPC. Lastly, it was told to the Court that the accused will have all the papers before the charges are framed. Court's observations At the outset, the Court perused the report from the Sessions Court regarding the status of the trial and noted that several accused have not appointed their Lawyers and even though the accused were offered amicus curiae, they refused to accept the amicus curiae.  It was also noted by the Court that the accused are lodged in different jails and many accused have filed discharge applications and are not cooperating in the trial. Against this backdrop, the Court, after considering the submissions advanced on behalf of the counsel for the accused-applicant as well as by the AGA and the counsel for the complainant, observed thus: "This Court having considered the gravity of offence, the manner in which it has been committed, and the evidence available on record, does not consider that the accused-applicant is entitled to be enlarged on bail at this stage. The accused applicant is the owner of the Somu Dhaba, where in a fracas, the deceased was beaten and when anyhow he could escape from there on his motorcycle and thereafter he came again, he was allegedly chased by the accused-applicant and other coaccused in two four wheeler vehicles and thereafter he was hit by one of the vehicle and then allegedly he was assaulted and killed in a most gruesome manner, which is evident from the post-mortem report.  In view of this, noting that the accused-applicant and other co-accused are not cooperating in the trial and they want to linger on the trial, the Court rejected Yadav's bail plea.  Appearances Counsel for Applicant:- Anupam Mehrotra,Anil Kumar Yadav  Counsel for Opposite Party:- G.A.,Aakash Prasad,Amitav Singh,Naved Ali,Vikas Vikram Singh Case title - Suresh Yadav Opposite Party :- State Of U.P.

The Supreme Court has directed the Ministry of Home Affairs to secure the presence of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya to serve the 4 months imprisonment imposed on him for contempt of court. In an order pronounced today, a bench led by Justice UU Lalit had imposed a sentence of 4 months imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2000 on Mallya for committing contempt of country by willful disobedience of court directions. The fine shall be deposited in the Registry of this Court within four weeks and upon such deposit, the amount shall be made over to the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee. In case the amount of fine is not deposited within the time stipulated, the Contemnor shall undergo further sentence of two months. Apart from the above, the Court directed the Union Government to secure Mallya's presence to serve the sentence. "We direct the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi to secure the presence of the Contemnor to undergo the imprisonment imposed upon him. Needless to say, Government of India including the Ministry of External Affairs and all other agencies or instrumentalities shall carry out the directions issued by this Court with due diligence and utmost expediency. A Compliance Report shall thereafter be filed in the Registry of this Court", the Court ordered. He was found guilty in 2017 for transferring USD 40 million to his children in violation of the orders passed in a case filed by a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India. Mallya, an accused in bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is in the United Kingdom. During the sentence hearing, the Union of India had informed the Court that though extradition of Mallya from the United Kingdom has been allowed, he could not be brought to India in view of some "secret" proceedings pending against him there, the details of which are not known to the Union Government. Although the Court deferred the sentence hearing few times to give an opportunity to Mallya to appear, it ultimately decided to proceed in his absence in view of his refusal to appear. Senior Advocate Jaideep Gupta was appointed as an amicus curiae in the case to assist the court in the in absentia hearing. Pronouncing the sentence today, the Court said that Mallya did not show any remorse for his conduct and did not appear before it during the sentence hearing. The Court added that adequate sentence must be imposed on him to "uphold the majesty of law" and that directions need to be issued to ensure that the amount in dispute is available for execution of the orders. Therefore, the Court has directed Mallya to deposit 40 million US Dollars with 8 percent interest within 4 weeks with the concerned recovery officer, failing which attachment proceedings will be initiated against his properties. If not deposited, the recovery officer shall take appropriate proceedings for recovery of the amount and the Government of India and its agencies shall provide assistance and complete cooperation. Mallya's transfer of 40 million to beneficiaries in breach of court orders has been declared "void and inoperative". Case Title : State Bank of India and others vs Dr.Vijay Mallya Contempt of Courts Act 1971- Vijay Mallya sentenced to 4 months imprisonment and Rs 2000 fine for contempt of court for disobedience of court orders- It is, well settled that apart from punishing the contemnor for his contumacious conduct, the majesty of law may demand that appropriate directions be issued by the court so that any advantage secured as a result of such contumacious conduct is completely nullified. The approach may require the court to pass directions either for reversal of the transactions in question by declaring said transactions to be void or passing appropriate directions to the concerned authorities to see that the contumacious conduct on the part of the contemnor does not continue to enure to the advantage of the contemnor or any one claiming under him- In a given case, to meet the ends of justice, the concept of purging of the contempt would call for complete disgorging of all the benefits secured as a result of actions which are found by the court to be contumacious - Para 13       
The Delhi High Court has held that a plea of passing-off cannot be negated solely on the ground that the Plaintiff had asserted trademark rights in the registered designs. A composite suit seeking action in respect of both design infringement and passing off is maintainable. A single judge bench comprising Justice Jyoti Singh observed that while it is trite that asserting trademark rights in registered designs makes the designs vulnerable, however, where the elements of the design are used as a larger trade dress get-up, presentation through its packaging etc., the passing off claim shall lie. It observed, "A composite suit that joins two causes of action, one for infringement of a registered design and other for passing off the Plaintiff's goods, is maintainable...Even if the Plaintiff asserts a claim of trademark in a registered design, which makes a design vulnerable, it is open to the Plaintiff to plead that it has a goodwill and reputation and Defendant No.1, by misrepresentation is passing off its goods as that of the Plaintiff, thereby causing damage and injury and Defendant No.1 by fraudulent imitation of the article to which the registered design is applied is guilty of infringement of the said design." The observation was made in a suit for alleged infringement of design and passing off filed by Havells India (Plaintiff), which claims to have conceptualised a design for ceiling fans called the ENTICER, against Panasonic Life Solutions (Defendant) over its new series of ceiling fans called VENICE PRIME which, as per the Plaintiff was a blatant copy of Plaintiff's design. It was contended that the class of consumers purchasing the competing products were unwary customers of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. The customer base generally includes electricians, electric contractors, builders etc. who purchase these products from the retail shops and usually do not read the mark or label or the name of the manufacturer on the packaging of the product and owing to the high degree of visual similarity in the products of the Plaintiff and Defendant, the Plaintiff stated that the chances of confusion were extremely high. Thus, it was submitted by the Plaintiff that it was entitled to an interim injunction against Defendant. Per contra, the Defendant submitted that the claim of novelty by Plaintiff was vague and its design did not qualify as 'new or original' and it was merely an introduction or substitution of ordinary trade variants in a prior published design. It was also contended that the Plaintiff had claimed trademark rights in the registered designs. Thus, having claimed trademark in the suit designs, the design registration becomes vulnerable and is liable to be cancelled under Section 19(1)(e) of the Act.  The Defendant relied on a Full Bench decision of the Delhi High Court in Carlsberg Breweries A/S v. Som Distilleries and Breweries Ltd., where it was held that if the registered design per se is used as a trademark, it can be cancelled. It was also contended that no monopoly can be claimed over a concept which is common place or exists in nature. In any event, it was contended that the Defendant's adoption of marble pattern was bona fide. The court first addressed the objection raised by the defendant that the Plaintiff had alleged infringement of designs under the Designs Act and has also asserted trademark rights in the registered designs as well as invoked the common law remedy of passing off, which are self-destructive pleas and make the Plaintiff's designs vulnerable. Here, the stand of the Plaintiff was that holder of a registered design can institute a suit for passing off and infringement of the registered design. Reliance was placed on Mohan Lal, Proprietor of Mourya Industries v. Sona Paint & Hardwares, 2013 SCC OnLine Del 1980 for the same. The court stated that a registered design per se if used as a trademark is liable for cancellation. However, where the elements of the design are not used as a trademark but a larger trade dress, get-up, presentation of the product through its packaging etc., action for passing off would lie, given that a passing off claim can include but is also wider than infringement of a trademark. The court found merit in the contention of Defendant that Plaintiff had sought to assert trademark rights in the registered designs, thereby making the designs vulnerable and entitling Defendant to take this as a defence. However, the question raised was whether irrespective of the said pleadings, Plaintiff could lay a claim of passing off, not restricted or limited to the registered design alone but in the overall get-up, trade dress etc. The court stated that – "It is settled law that parties can raise alternate and inconsistent pleas but should not be permitted to raise pleas which are mutually destructive of each other. Therefore, even if the Plaintiff asserts a claim of trademark in a registered design, which makes a design vulnerable, it is open to the Plaintiff to plead that it has a goodwill and reputation and Defendant No.1, by misrepresentation is passing off its goods as that of the Plaintiff, thereby causing damage and injury and Defendant No.1 by fraudulent imitation of the article to which the registered design is applied is guilty of infringement of the said design." Thus, the plea of passing off could not be negated only on the ground that the Plaintiff had asserted trademark rights in the registered designs and required consideration on its own merits. The court opined that in order to succeed, Plaintiff was required to establish that Defendant had misrepresented to the public that its goods are that of the Plaintiff, resulting in injury and harm to Plaintiff's reputation. Insofar as Plaintiff's Design was concerned, it was registered for 'shape and configuration'. Therefore, the claim for passing off could only be asserted in 'something extra' beyond the registered design which could only be in the ornamentation, overall get up, trade dress, etc.  The court stated that to determine infringement under Section 22(1) of the Act, the test was to compare the rival designs and judge by the eye, if the essential features of the impugned design were substantially different from the registered design sought to be protected. In the present case, the court found that the visual comparison of the two fans showed that the visual features of the two competing designs were strikingly similar to the eye. The court also found that the defendant was estopped from taking any objection to the novelty of Plaintiff's design since it has itself applied for registration of its own design in 2021 and the application was for registration in shape, configuration and surface pattern. Thus, its contention that no monopoly could be claimed over a concept which is common place or exists in nature was devoid of merit. The court held that– "Estoppel prevents Defendant No.1 from taking such contradictory stands. And the principle is clearly based on the maxim quod approbo non reprobo that no party to a litigation can be allowed to approve and reject or blow hot and cold at the same time." The court also found that from a mere visual comparison, it was visible that every attempt had been made by Defendant to come as close as possible to Plaintiff's fans. The impugned product had the same shape and configuration, ornamentation on the blade, body ring on bottom cover, layout and placement of the ornamentation. The court also stated that minute dissimilarities were not proof of the fact that the design was not copied as if the Courts were to examine the dissimilarities with great minuteness, no Plaintiff would ever succeed in a claim for infringement or passing off as a clever Defendant, with some skill would always be in a position to make some cosmetic or minor changes and get away with deceit and infringement. Finally, regarding the argument of Defendant's design being bona fide, the court stated that if the design in question was such a common place, why did the defendant not use the same on the fans before. It was only after the Plaintiff designed its fans and earned goodwill and reputation did the Defendant came out with the impugned products. The court held that this was not merely a coincidence. It was held that this was misrepresentation with a view to deceive the public and encash on the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff. The argument that the packaging of the fans was different and contained the name of Defendant was not accepted by the court. The court held that it was common knowledge that ceiling fans were displayed as installed on the ceilings without boxes. Thus, it was only after the customer had chosen a particular fan, a fresh piece packed in a box was given to the customer on payment. Thus, the Defendant could easily pass off its fans as that of Plaintiff's. Accordingly, the could held that the Defendant was infringing the design of the Plaintiff and passing off its goods as that of the Plaintiff, thereby deceiving the public. Thus, interim injunction was granted in favour of the Plaintiff. Case Title: HAVELLS INDIA LIMITED v. PANASONIC LIFE SOLUTIONS INDIA PVT LTD & ANR.  
The Supreme Court observed that, a Court would not be justified in allowing the amendment of plaint if the nature of the suit is likely to be changed. The bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna also observed that the Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to join any party as a defendant who may not be necessary and / or proper parties at all on the ground that the plaintiffs is the dominus litus. In this case, the High Court of Delhi in Commercial Suits under Order 1 Rule 10 and Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, permitted the original plaintiff to amend the respective suits and also ordered impleadment of mortgagees (Banks). The plaintiffs in the suit had sought a decree of declaration that the license in favour of the plaintiff in respect of shop/ premises is irrevocable and perpetual and the purported revocation of the License by the defendant is illegal, void and bad in the eyes of law. A decree was also sought for a declaration declaring that the plaintiff has unfettered right to occupy and use the said premises / shop under the irrevocable license till the documents of transfer / conveyance are executed by the defendant. The plaintiff proposed to amend the suit challenging various mortgages created by the defendant hotel, in favour of certain banks. Assailing these orders, the appellant contended that the impleadment and amendment applications are mala fide filed only to circumvent adjudication pending Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On the other hand, respondents contended that at the stage of allowing the amendment the Court should not be concerned with the merits and demerits of such amendments. The Apex Court bench noted that the High Court while allowing the amendment application in exercise of powers under Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure has not properly appreciated the fact and / or considered the fact that as such, by granting such an amendment and permitting plaintiffs to amend the plaints incorporating the prayer clause to declare the respective charges / mortgages void ab­initio, the nature of the suits will be changed. "As per the settled proposition of law, if, by permitting plaintiffs to amend the plaint including a prayer clause nature of the suit is likely to be changed, in that case, the Court would not be justified in allowing the amendment. It would also result in misjoinder of causes of action.....The principle that the plaintiffs is the dominus litus shall be applicable only in a case where parties sought to be added as defendants are necessary and / or proper parties. Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to join any party as a defendant who may not be necessary and / or proper parties at all on the ground that the plaintiffs is the dominus litus" The court therefore held that in a suit challenging revocation of the respective licenses, the plaintiffs cannot be permitted to challenge the respective mortgages / charges created on the entire premises as void ab­initio.

The Manipur High Court has granted bail to a person alleged to have committed murder of two women and an unborn child in 2017. "A humane attitude is required to be adopted by a Judge while dealing with the bail application. Even if the offence is a serious offence, requires a humane treatment by the Court, humane treatment to all including an accused is requirement of law," Acting Chief Justice M.V Muralidaran said in the order.   The court also observed that the important facet of criminal jurisprudence is that the grant of bail is the general rule and putting a person in jail or in a prison or in a correctional home is an exception. "Unfortunately, some of these basic principles appear to have been lost sight of with the result that more and more persons are being incarcerated and for longer periods. This does not do any good to our criminal jurisprudence or to our society," it added, while relying on Supreme Court's observations in Dataram Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.  The Imphal police had registered an FIR under Section 302/449/120-B IPC in 2017 on the complaint made by Soram Tomba Singh whose wife and pregnant daughter were killed inside his house. During investigation, the accused Khongbantabam Hitler Singh was arrested. The complainant's daughter was eight-months pregnant at the time of alleged murder. The counsel representing the accused told the court that the main reason for suspicion of the police is that accused "once had love affairs" with the victim before her marriage and her mother was against the relationship and hence he had been looking for an opportunity to eliminate "his lover and her mother".  It was argued that the accused has been falsely implicated in this case as he was arrested by the police on 2.6.2017 after calling him and detaining at Imphal Police Station in the name of suspicion. The counsel further submitted that the trial Court had framed charges against the petitioner on 28.3.2018 and still the case is pending for examination of prosecution side witnesses. "Though so far 10-11 prosecution side witnesses were examined, still the prosecution has to examine 12-13 more witnesses which will take long years and the prosecution is not co-operating with the trial Court for speedy disposal of the case," it was submitted.  The court was told that there is no possibility of concluding the trial in near future and the accused has been in judicial custody for more than 5 years. Detaining the petitioner in jail for an indefinite period is deprived of his fundamental rights provided under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, his counsel argued.  The prosecution counsel submitted that the Additional Sessions Judge (FTC) Crime Against Women, Manipur, in the order dated 28.3.2018 had come to the conclusion that there is prima facie evidence or suspicion against the accused person for committing murder and causing death of unborn child amounting to culpable homicide. Acting Chief Justice Muralidharan said the trial has started way back in 2018 and it is not the case of the prosecution that the accused has delayed the trial. "On the other hand, the record reveals that due to failure of the prosecution in bringing the witnesses, the trial stands adjourned from time to time," the bench noted. The court also said that merits of the crime cannot be gone into even though the case involved double murder of two women and unborn baby in the womb.  Observing that grant or denial of bail is entirely the discretion of the judge considering the bail application and the same is regulated to a large extent by the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the court said the petitioner has sought bail mainly on the ground of delay in the trial, which started way back in the year 2018 itself.  "The pandemic started during March, 2020 and in between 2018 and March 2020, no sufficient progress had been taken to conclude the trial," it added.  The court noted that the way in which the trial is being conducted in the case clearly shows that it is not likely to be concluded in near future and agreed with the argument that keeping the petitioner in custody indefinitely till the completion of trial would cause great hardship to him and also hits personal liberty. "When the under-trial prisoners are detained in jail custody to an indefinite period, Article 21 of the Constitution of India is violated. Therefore, the petitioner cannot be made to languish behind bars for a longer period of time," said the court, adding that the Supreme Court has held that a procedure which keeps large number of people behind bars without trial, for long, cannot be regarded as "reasonable, just, fair" so as to be in conformity with the provisions of Article 21. Observing that though the allegation against the petitioner is of very serious nature, the court noted that trial of the case has not concluded yet for one reason or the other. "In the interest of justice and in view of the undertaking given by the petitioner that he shall remain present in person before the trial Court on the date fixed for the examination of the last prosecution witness as well as till the stage of examination of him under Section 313 Cr.P.C. and its final order, this Court is of the view that the petitioner can be enlarged on bail in the given facts and circumstances of the case, however, subject to certain conditions," it said, while allowing the bail application.

The Gujarat High Court has observed that the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act 2007. The Bench of Dr. Justice Ashokkumar C. Joshi referred to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of S Vanitha vs. Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District, wherein it was held that the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act. The facts in brief  Essentially, the petitioner, Jagdeepbhai Chandulal Patel (a senior citizen) is the father-in-law of respondent No. 1, Reshma Ruchin Patel, and the father of the respondent No. 2, who is presently residing in the USA. Allegedly, his daughter-in-law, respondent No. 1, illegally trespassed his house and eventually, the petitioner had to move out of his house and reside at a different place, and accordingly, he moved a suit before the Family Court at Ahmedabad along with an interim injunction application. He prayed for the issuance of order/directions to respondent No. 1, along with minor Kashvi to remove themselves from his house and to restrain them from using or occupying the said property as their residence.  The said application came to be rejected by the Family Court in March 2021. The petitioner's written statement-cum-Reply-cum-injunction application, praying as aforesaid, was also dismissed by way of the impugned order, and therefore, being grieved by the same, the petitioner came to the High Court, under the provisions of the Act of Senior Citizens Act 2007. He claimed before the High Court that he is entitled to the said dwelling house and thus, an order be issued to evict his daughter-in-law (respondent No. 1) therefrom.  Whereas, the case of respondent no. 1  is that she, being the daughter-in-law of the petitioner, is entitled to the shared household in her matrimonial home and she cannot be evicted from the same under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Court's observations At the outset, the Court noted that the issue, largely involved in the petition was with regard to the applicability of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 vis-a-vis the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and inter se overriding effect thereof. Referring to S Vanitha vs. Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District, the Court came to the conclusion that the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act has no overriding effect over the right of residence of a woman in a shared household within the meaning of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. "Allowing the Senior Citizens Act 2007 to have an overriding force and effect in all situations, irrespective of competing entitlements of a woman to a right in a shared household within the meaning of the PWDV Act 2005, would defeat the object and purpose which the Parliament sought to achieve in enacting the latter legislation. The law protecting the interest of senior citizens is intended to ensure that they are not left destitute, or at the mercy of their children or relatives. Equally, the purpose of the PWDV Act 2005 cannot be ignored by a sleight of statutory interpretation. Both sets of legislation have to be harmoniously construed. Hence the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act 2007," the Court stressed.  Further, the Court also observed that the right to reside in the shared household continues till the victim proves that she is a victim of domestic violence. Accordingly, the Court held, that respondent No. 1, under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act, has the right to a shared household.  Importantly, the Court also concluded that merely an offer being made to provide another suitable accommodation, cannot snatch away the legitimate right of respondent No. 1 of a shared household. With this, the Court held that the Family Court did not commit any error and therefore, the petition failed and was dismissed.

The Rajasthan High Court has refused to regularize the admissions of 16 medical aspirants who were admitted to a Dental College in Kota, without qualifying the NEET examination. It however granted Rs.10 Lakhs compensation to each such student, stating that the College had made a "false promise" assuring them a seat in MDS course.  The court also directed the Vice Chancellor of the respondent-Rajasthan University of Health Sciences to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the erring officials who had handed over degrees of the Petitioner-students, despite an order of the court to withhold the same.  Justice Ashok Kumar Gaur observed,  "The fact remains that the petitioners were admitted in the Course in the year 2017 and their three years in the College is sheer wastage of energy, time and money spent on their education by their parents...This Court, though cannot regularize the admissions which were granted to the petitioners, however, the petitioners need to be compensated by the respondent-College for the illegality committed by them while giving admission to the petitioners and further furnishing incorrect and false information to different authorities i.e. respondent-University and respondent-DCI."  Background  The 16 petitioners were admitted in MDS Course in the respondent-College in May, 2017. As per Information booklet for NEET for admission to MDS Course, a candidate was to obtain a minimum qualifying score. However, petitioners did not secure the requisite cut-off marks in NEET PG Examination, 2017 and were granted admission by the College after the mop-up round was over. Moreover, all the petitioners were not found to be qualified as per the scorecards issued by National Board of Examinations.  The enrollment forms, filled in by the petitioners in the University, reflected the marks of the petitioners and the same were at variance/different, as per the record available with the NEET PG Admission Board. Later, the respondent-College uploaded the list of the students admitted in the MDS Course on the Dental Council of India's web portal and was subsequently ordered to discharge 16 students, who were admitted illegally in the MDS Course in the year 2017. However, the respondent-College permitted the petitioners to undertake the course and did not challenge the said orders.   Under the aforesaid circumstances, the petitioners pleaded that in spite of completing three year course of their study, the denial of the respondent-University to issue enrollment number and preventing the petitioners to participate in the examination was an arbitrary act and as such, the petitioners filed the writ petition praying for direction to allow them to fill online examination forms and to participate in MDS Final Year (Main) Examination to be held in June, 2020.   Notably, after the judgment was initially reserved on 19.04.2022, the respondent-University had sent the degrees of 16 students–petitioners of MDS Batch, 2017 to the respondent-College and the said degrees were distributed to the petitioners from 20.05.2022 to 30.05.2022.   Court's Observations  The court noted that some of the petitioners did not even appear in the NEET PG Examination, 2017 and yet while filling up the enrollment form, they all have shown themselves to have appeared in the NEET PG Examination, 2017 and some of them also gave incorrect information relating to the marks obtained by them in the NEET PG Examination. By supplying incorrect information to the University authorities and by furnishing false information of having secured qualifying marks in the NEET examination, the petitioners cannot be allowed to plead that notice or opportunity was required to be given to them, added the court.  It was observed by the court that petitioners got admission by wrong means knowing fully well about their eligibility and as such they cannot be permitted to claim right in their favour of offering them opportunity of hearing before discharging them from the course, in which they got admission in an illegal manner.   Further, the court refused the petitioners' submission that seats in medical courses should not go waste and admissions given to the candidates may be regularized. In this regard, the court opined that if the submission is accepted, then Colleges/admission bodies will be acting on their own to adjudge the eligibility of different persons for the professional courses and the candidates without having the requisite eligibility and merit will be able to get admission and then seal of approval will be sought from the Courts of law that such persons need to be regularized for the purpose of pursuing professional courses.  Reliance was placed by the court on Abdul Ahad & Ors. Vs. UOI & Ors., wherein Apex Court had laid down the law that if the admissions in the medical college are granted by conducting private counseling then such admissions are termed as per se illegal. The Apex Court had further held that when the admissions granted to the students through private counseling, are found to be per se illegal, then such admissions cannot be protected, as the said admissions were done in a patently illegal manner.  The court observed that admission of the petitioners by illegal means, cannot be retained. The court noted that the Apex Court in Gurdeep Singh Vs. State of J&K & Ors. [AIR 1993 SC 2638] had considered the issue of admission by illegal means and such wrongs were not allowed to be retained by an appeal to the sympathy of the Court.  The court opined that University authorities who have issued the degrees to the respondent-College have acted in the most irresponsible, callous and illegal manner. The fact of restraint order, being passed by the Division Bench of the Court, was very much in the knowledge of the University authorities and in spite of having the knowledge of such restraint order, if they have handed over the degrees of the petitioners to the respondent-College, they need to be dealt with by this Court in strict manner, added the court  Furthermore, the court added that their explanation by terming such action to be a human error and further only by giving letter of calling upon explanation from two subordinate staff i.e. Section Officer and Senior Assistant, is no solution/answer to the blunder committed by the University authorities.   The court also observed,  "This Court is also required to see the conduct of the respondent-Dental College as in what manner, admissions were granted by them to the petitioners and further in spite of the discharge order passed by the DCI in the year 2018, yet the petitioners were allowed to continue with their studies by permitting them to complete three year MDS Course and apparently made them eligible for claiming relief of appearing in the examination on completion of three years."  Sr Adv. Ravindra Shrivastava assisted by Adv. S.S. Hora, Adv. Arpit Sharma and Adv. Kartikey Kumar appeared for the petitioners while Adv. Ajay Shukla, Adv. Ravi Chirania, Adv. Harshal Tholia on behalf of AAG Dr.V.B.Sharma, Adv. Angad Mirdha and Adv. Abhinav Sharma appeared for the respondents.  Case Title: Madhu Saini & Ors. v.

The Bombay High Court has declared as "unjustified" and "Illegal" Maharashtra Government's decision to allow members of the Maratha community to avail benefits under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category midway through an electricity distribution recruitment drive.  The court said that Maratha community candidates (SEBC candidates) were aware that their selection process would be subject to Supreme Court's order in the Maratha Reservation matter.  So once SC's interim order barred them from being considered under the reserved category of MSEBC Act in 2020, the State couldn't have issued a GR permitting eligible candidates to be considered under the EWS reservation.   "EWS category candidates definitely had accrued right to be considered for appointment. In such circumstances, the decision of the State to permit such migration midway through the selection process is arbitrary and unfair," the division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice MS Karnik held.   Consequently, the bench allowed petitions filed by candidates selected under the EWS category against the GR and dismissed pleas by SEBC candidates for recruitment under the EWS category.   Facts of the Case  In 2019, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) issued an advertisement for filling up certain vacancies. There were two categories (EWS and SEBC) for appointments under the reserved category.  Since the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act itself was under challenge, SEBC candidates were informed that their recruitment would be subject to the outcome of the case.   After the constitutional validity of the Act was upheld in the Bombay High Court, the SC in an interim order said that appointments to public services and posts under the Government shall be made without implementing the reservation as provided under the MSEBC Act.   It was at this stage, after the names of selected candidates under each category were released, that the Maharashtra Government issued the government resolution thereby permitting the candidates belonging to the Maratha community to avail the benefit of open category or EWS category as per their eligibility.  Arguments  Candidates of the EWS category contended that State Government's action allowing eligible SEBC category candidates benefits under the EWS category was "completely arbitrary and unconstitutional." Introducing a reservation for SEBC category at such an advanced stage of the recruitment process is impermissible, they said.   The SEBC said the State's decision permitting them to participate in the selection process was an informed decision which should be taken to its logical conclusion. They had a legitimate expectation to be considered for appointment.   Moreover, since there was a condition that the recruitment would be subject to SC's final orders, EWS category candidates could not claim a vested right to be appointed against the existing vacancies.   Observations  In its order, the High Court distinguished the present case from the 2021 judgement of the Supreme Court in Neil Aurelio Nunes vs Union of India and Ors. (OBC Reservation case) wherein as a result of the reservation for OBCs, there was a change in the seat matrix after registration.  The court held that in the present case the EWS category hadn't come later on.   "While we have sympathy for the SEBC candidates, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that the situation is the result of their own making. The SEBC candidates were aware about the matter pending before the Supreme Court despite which they took a chance to participate in the recruitment process claiming reservation meant for SEBC," the court held.

The Rajasthan High Court has observed that a citizen approaching the court in a public interest jurisdiction holds greater duty to make full research and present necessary facts before the court to cause further investigation. In the present matter, serious allegations were made by the petitioners with respect to mis-management of the respondent No. 2, Arth Credit Cooperative Society. A division bench of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice Rekha Borana, while disposing of the petition, observed,  "A citizen approaching the Court in a public interest jurisdiction holds a greater duty to make full research and present necessary facts before the Court to cause further investigation." Refusing to entertain the petition, the court also observed that in the present public interest litigation, there is no supporting documents or informative evidence, even prima facie sustaining serious allegations made by the petitioners with respect to mis-management of the respondent No.2. 
Holding that the State has a duty to protect the life of its citizens, the Patna High Court on Wednesday granted Rs. 10 lakh as compensation to the father of a 18 years old boy who died in October last year in the Munger Maa Durga Pooja firing incident.

Holding that the State has a duty to protect the life of its citizens, the Patna High Court on Wednesday granted Rs. 10 lakh as compensation to the father of a 18 years old boy who died in October last year in the Munger Maa Durga Pooja firing incident.  The order is significant as compensation has been granted pending investigation into the firing incident.  A Single Bench of Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad observed that it is irrelevant, for the purpose of granting compensation, as to who was behind the firing that led to the unfortunate demise of the boy, as it is the duty of the State to protect the lives of its citizens.  The order stated,  "The State had a responsibility to safeguard the life of a citizen…Whether son of the petitioner died as a result of firing by police or by any miscreants from the mob would not be relevant for the simple reason that in any case the State had failed to protect the life of the son of the petitioner who was a spectator in the procession of Maa Durga Idole Immersion."  Background  The incident occurred in October 2020, during the Durga Puja idol immersions in Munger.   As per the authorities, problem of law and order arose during the procession and the people participating in the procession turned into unlawful and unruly assembly, and started pelting stones and opened fire on security forces.  The Petitioner on the other hand claimed that the Munger Police led by then Superintendent of Police did not follow the procedures provided under the Bihar Police Manual in the matter of resorting to firing on a crowd, and they indulged in indiscriminate and brutal firing on the devotees.  He alleged that the Police personnel did not resort to any alternative method to control the crowd, prior to firing police.  The incident led to death of the Petitioner's son and injured around 30 people.  The instant writ petition was filed by the Petitioner seeking independent probe into the incident by CBI.  Arguments  The Petitioner placed before the Court the internal report of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) which stated that the bullet firing was initiated by Munger Police.  He alleged that because of the political clout and connections of the then Superintendent of Police, the investigation has not progressed.   He submitted that as an eye-wash, a team of eight police personnel was constituted under leadership of the newly transferred SP and directions were issued to the SIT to conduct investigation on several points but such direction of the supervising authority i.e. D.I.G., Munger were completely ignored.  The SIT merely made a 'special report' case on paper on the basis of a very shoddy and perfunctory kind of investigation.  The Petitioner further informed the Court that the matter has been transferred to CID of Bihar Police. However, since the then SP is closely related to the head of the ruling party in the State, thus there is reasonable apprehension that the CID (which is under State Government) will not be able to investigate the matter independently.  It was also alleged that key witnesses of the case were being framed in illegal liquor cases by District police.  Findings  At the outset, the Bench observed that the Petitioner has not put anything on record against CID so as to cast a cloud over the credibility of its investigation.   "This Court has prima-facie observed that Munger police and the SIT constituted for purpose of investigation of the case has not acted in natural direction but, in the changed circumstances where CID is now investigating the case, this Court in absence of any cogent material is not ready to accept the spacious plea of learned counsel for the petitioner that the 'CID' is not likely to investigate the case in a free and fair manner against the police personnel. No material showing wielding of influence by any person or authority over the 'CID' has been placed before this Court," the order stated.  Thus, stating that transfer of investigation is not imperative at this stage, the Bench refused to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.   Reliance was placed on Sakiri Vasu v. State of UP, AIR 2008 SC 907, whereby the Supreme Court held as under:  "This Court or the High Court has power under Article 136 or Article 226 to order investigation by the CBI. That, however should be done only in some rare and exceptional cases, otherwise, the CBI would be flooded with a large number of cases and would find it impossible to properly investigate all of them."  Reference was also made to the case of Arnab Ranjan Goswami v. Union of India & Ors., 2020 SCC Online SC 462, whereby the Supreme Court refused to transfer the investigation from Mumbai Police to CBI.   The Apex Court had reiterated therein, "…The transfer of an investigation to the CBI is not a matter of routine. The precedents of this Court emphasise that this is an "extraordinary power" to be used "sparingly" and "in exceptional circumstances".  The Bench further held that the apprehensions expressed by Petitioner by pointing out the relationship of the then SP with the head of the Ruling Party of the State has no basis to stand at this stage.  "Moreover, in the writ petition there is no specific statement in this regard and they are not made party in the present writ application. In the case of Prof. K.V. Rajendran (supra) a plea of 'bias' was rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court when it was found that the person against whom plea of 'bias' is being taken has not been made party and he had no notice," the Bench added.  It was of the opinion that since CID has already assumed the investigation, it must get an opportunity to act freely, collect all the evidences and submit its first report to the Court in a sealed cover. Time of four weeks has been granted for this purpose.  The Court however deemed it just and proper to monitor the investigation for the present, keeping in mind the purpose of continuing mandamus in a Court monitored investigation.  It has also ordered that the case file of this case shall not be go to any other authority (certainly to avoid interference in the investigation).  Furthermore, in order to ensure free and fair investigation of the case, the State has been asked to shift all the eight members of the SIT, including SP Munger, to some other place for the present, within three days.  On the issue of compensation, the Court found that the facts disclosed so far that the son of the Petitioner was unarmed in the procession, and there was no allegation that he was indulged in any unlawful act.   Thus, it directed the State respondents to pay a sum of Rs. 10 laks towards compensation within one month to the Petitioner, who being the father of the deceased has remained in mental pains and sufferings.   It is, however, left open for the Petitioner to claim further compensation under private law remedy against the wrongdoer.  Arguments for the Petitioner were led by Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, assisted by Advocate Manas Prakash.  Respondents were represented by AG Lalit Kishore, AAG Anjani Kumar assisted by Advocate Shailendra Kumar Singh and Govt Pleader Nadim Seraj assisted by Advocate Shailesh Kumar.  The case is fixed for May 6, 2021.  Case Title: Amar Nath Poddar v. State of Bihar & Ors.    Read Order

"It cannot be assumed that a litigant would keep waiting for the adjudication of his disputes, if the competent Forum or the Authority is not functioning," the Rajasthan High Court observed recently.  The remarks were made by Justice Rekha Borana while hearing an application filed by the Centre seeking dismissal of a petition relating to recruitment in Civil Service, on the ground of alternate remedy. The petition was filed before the High Court due to admitted vacancy in Central Administrative Tribunal at the time. The Bench, while dismissing the application filed by the respondents, observed,  "Therefore, any litigant cannot be left remediless. It cannot be assumed that a litigant would keep waiting for the adjudication of his disputes, if the competent Forum or the Authority is not functioning. It cannot also be the intention of the legislation to make a litigant suffer because of the inaction or lacuna on the part of the system. The fact of the CAT not functioning at the relevant time being not disputed, the dismissal of the writ petition at this stage i.e. after four years of filing of the same and being entertained by this Court, would not be in the interest of justice now only on the ground of alternative remedy."  Essentially, the court, on 29.05.2018, directed the respondents to keep one post of Section Supervisor (Examination Quota) vacant while filling the said posts vide the Departmental Examination which was scheduled to be held in June, 2018. The present writ petition was entertained on the ground that the Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal was not available/not functioning at that relevant time. Now, an application has been preferred by the respondents with the preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the present writ petition.  It has been averred in the application that Sections 14 and 15 of the Central Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 provide for a specific bar in the matters pertaining to the recruitment to any All India Service or to any Civil Service of the Union. It has also been submitted that the jurisdiction to decide such matters lies with the CAT and in terms of Section 15(4), there is a specific bar for exercise of such jurisdiction by any other Authority or Tribunal. The counsel for the respondents submitted at present the CAT is functioning and therefore, the petitioner be relegated to the said Authority.  The court noted that the application does not contradict the said fact that the Tribunal was not functioning or not available at the time when the present writ petition was filed. The court stated that there is no dispute on the position of law that an alternative remedy does lie before the CAT in the service matters pertaining to All India Services or Civil Services governed by the Union.  The court, while observing that any litigant cannot be left remediless, stated that in the present matter, the writ petition had been entertained only because of the fact that the competent Authority i.e. the CAT was not functioning/available at the relevant time. The court also added that is not because of any fault on the part of the petitioner that the writ petition had been filed before the court and the same being entertained once, now after a period of four years and after the service of the notices on the respondents, it would not be appropriate to relegate the parties to the Tribunal.  Moreover, the court refused to accept the application of the respondents for dismissal of the writ petition on the ground of alternative remedy because of the peculiar facts and circumstances in the present case.. Placing reliance on Har Kaur Chadha & Ors. v. NCT of Delhi & Ors (2016) of the Delhi High Court, it was observed by the court that to relegate the petitioner to an alternative remedy at this stage would needlessly cause delay and prejudice the petitioner.  Adv. Shreyansh Mardia appeared on behalf of the petitioner while Adv. Yashpal Khileree appeared on behalf of the respondent(s).  Case Title: Prem Chand Deshantri v. Union of India

The Supreme Court has held that Consumer Courts can grant relief to flatbuyers who are aggrieved with the delay in delivery of the apartment as per the agreement. Consumer Courts have the power to direct refund and compensation to a consumer for the deficiency in not delivering the apartment as per the terms of Agreement, the Court held. "A consumer invoking the jurisdiction of the Commission can seek such reliefs as he/she considers appropriate. A consumer can pray for refund of the money with interest and compensation. The consumer could also ask for possession of the apartment with compensation.", the bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and PS Narasimha observed. In this case, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed a Developer to refund an amount of Rs. 2,06,41,379 with interest @ 9% p.a. to the Consumer for its failure to deliver possession of the apartment within the time stipulated as per the Apartment Buyers Agreement. The issue raised in the appeal by the builder are the following: I. Whether the terms of the Apartment Buyers Agreement amount to an 'unfair trade practice' and whether the Commission is justified in not giving effect to the terms of Apartment Buyer's Agreement as laid down in the Pioneer case?  II. Whether the Commission has the power under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to direct refund of the amount deposited by the Consumer with interest? Regarding the first issue, the bench upheld the Commission's finding that the clauses of the agreement are one-sided and that the Consumer is not bound to accept the possession of the apartment and can seek refund of the amount deposited by her with interest. On the second issue, the bench first considered the submission of the appellant that the Consumer, having elected to proceed under the Act, the provisions of the RERA Act will have no application. Referring to Imperia Structures Ltd v. Anil Patni (2020) 10 SCC 783 and IREO Grace Realtech (P) Ltd. V. Abhishek Khanna (2021) 3 SCC 241, the bench observed that Consumer Protection Act and the RERA Act neither exclude nor contradict each other. In this regard, the court observed: "When Statutes provisioning judicial remedies fall for construction, the choice of the interpretative outcomes should also depend on the constitutional duty to create effective judicial remedies in furtherance of access to justice. A meaningful interpretation that effectuates access to justice is a constitutional imperative and it is this duty that must inform the interpretative criterion.. When Statutes provide more than one judicial fora for effectuating a right or to enforce a duty-obligation, it is a feature of remedial choices offered by the State for an effective access to justice. Therefore, while interpreting statutes provisioning plurality of remedies, it is necessary for Courts to harmonise the  provisions in a constructive manner." Referring to Section 14 of Consumer Protection act, the bench , while dismissing the appeal filed by the developer, observed: 15. We may hasten to clarify that the power to direct refund of the amount and to compensate a consumer for the deficiency in not delivering the apartment as per the terms of Agreement is within the jurisdiction of the Consumer Courts. Under Section 14 of the Consumer Protection Act, if the Commission is satisfied …that any of the allegations contained in the complaint about the services are proved, it shall issue an order to the opposite party directing him to, return to the complainant the price or as the case may be, the charges paid by the complainant. 'Deficiency' is defined under Section 2(g) to include any shortcoming or inadequacy in performance which has been undertaken by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise relating to any service. These two provisions are reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference.13 It is clear from the statutory position that the Commission is empowered to direct refund of the price or the charges paid by the consumer A consumer invoking the jurisdiction of the Commission can seek such reliefs as he/she considers appropriate. A consumer can pray for refund of the money with interest and compensation. The consumer could also ask for possession of the apartment with compensation. The consumer can also make a prayer for both in the alternative. If a consumer prays for refund of the amount, without an alternative prayer, the Commission will recognize such a right and grant it, of course subject to the merits of the case. If a consumer seeks alternative reliefs, the Commission will consider the matter in the facts and circumstances of the case and will pass appropriate orders as justice demands. This position is similar to the mandate under Section 18 of the RERA Act.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday (17th March) ordered the release of a Nepali man who was arrested about 41 years ago and since then he had been under detention.  The bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Aniruddha Roy ordered thus after noting that current mental age in terms of intellectual functioning of the Man is around 9 years and 9 months.  The bench was hearing the case of one Dipak Joshi, who was arrested on 12th May 1980 and has already undergone a period of more than 40 years in custody.  Nepali Man In Custody For 40 Years: Calcutta High Court To Examine If The Prosecution Be Terminated In Suo Moto Proceedings  On the basis of the materials on record, the Court observed that after the assessment of his mental status (sometime in January 1982) when he was found to be not mentally fit to stand trial, there had been no contrary report at any point of time even as of now before the Court of Session where the case is pending trial.  Thus, in the exercise of authority under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, the Court ordered his release after noting,  "In the aforesaid view of the matter, we do not see that any useful purpose will subserve the ends of justice by continuing to detain UTP Dipak Joshi @ Jaisi @ Jaishi in the Correctional Home."  The Court ordered that the Man (housed in Dum Dum Correctional Home) in connection with Sessions Case No.31 of 1981 in the First Additional District & Sessions Judges, Darjeeling is released from the Correctional Home and entrusted to the custody of Prakash Chandra Sharma Timsina.  "It is impossible and impermissible to direct the UTP to execute any bond in view of the deficit in his mental capacity. Ends of justice will be satisfied if his release is supported by a simple bond executed by the aforementioned, Prakash Chandra Sharma Timsina in favour of the Registrar General of this Court undertaking to produce the UTP as and when directed by this Court", the Court added.  Lastly, the Court directed all Statutory Authorities to facilitate the transit of UTP Dipak Joshi @ Jaisi @ Jaishi to Nepal under the aegis of the Consulate General of Nepal in India at Kolkata upon his release.

While dismissing the anticipatory bail application filed in a fake lawyer case, the Kerala High Court remarked that a lawyer owes paramount responsibility to his client first, and to the court second. Justice Shircy V in her order also observed that the legal profession was one of the noblest: "The lawyers' profession is considered to be one of the noblest professions. Lawyers have to play a pivotal role in the administration of justice as only with their sincere and purposeful effort and assistance the Courts could administer justice properly." The Bench laid down a few duties shouldered by the legal fraternity in its judgment, particularly towards the Courts: "They owe onerous responsibility and duty towards the Courts and they are considered as the officers of the Courts." However, it was substantiated that their foremost duty lay towards their clients.  "Their first responsibility is towards their clients and then to the courts. So, misrepresenting or presenting as an Advocate before a client and obtaining his/her brief as if she is an Advocate, itself would amount to cheating towards the public." While denying pre-arrest bail to Xavier, the Single Judge ruled that the Bar Associations must cross-check and verify with the Bar Council before admitting a new member to prevent similar incidents in the future.  The observation came in a matter where the petitioner had practised in the State as an Advocate for over two years without enrollment and had approached the Court with an anticipatory bail application upon the incident coming to light.  The Bench while dismissing the application observed that she had not merely deceived the Bar Association or the general public, but the entire Judicial system.

The Delhi High Court has observed that a child is entitled to get admission in the school allotted by Directorate of Education (DoE) on the reserved seats under RTE Act after it is established that he or she belongs to the economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group (DG) category. Justice Mini Pushkarna said that denying admission to any child under DG or EWS category after allotment of school by DOE pursuant to due procedure followed by it, would be in violation of The Right of Children To Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 which provides for free and compulsory education to every child between 6 to 14 years.  Noting that section 12 of the RTE Act provides for reservation of atleast 25% for weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, Justice Pushkarna said: “Thus, once, it is established that the child belongs to economically weaker section of the society or disadvantaged group and after satisfaction on this account, school has been allotted by DOE as per its due procedure, such child is entitled to get admission in the allotted school under the said category.”  The court allowed the petition of a child seeking admission in a school on the ground that he was successful in draw of lots for admission DG category.  It was his case that an allotment letter was also issued to him by DoE and that he had the Scheduled Caste Certificate issued in favour of his father.  The counsel appearing for the school submitted that the SC Certificate showed the petitioner’s residential address approximately 8 to 10 kilometres away from the school.   On the other hand, the DoE submitted that once a school has been allotted in the draw of lots, the school is bound to give admission to the child.  Granting relief to the petitioner, the court said that the child has been duly allotted the school by the DOE under DG category after following due procedure and thus he is entitled to be granted admission.  “In view of the aforesaid submissions, the present petition is allowed. However, considering the fact that the current academic session 2022-2023 is already at its fag end, the petitioner is directed to be granted admission in the Nursery class for the academic session 2023-2024,” it said.

The Allahabad High Court last week granted bail to a man who has been accused of posting objectionable pictures of the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi on Facebook and WhatsApp which allegedly enraged the public at large. The Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal granted him bail keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence on record regarding the complicity of the accused, larger mandate of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The case in brief Essentially, the prosecution has alleged that the applicant, Chhangur Yadav enraged and hurt the sentiments of the public at large by posting objectionable pictures of the Prime Minister of India and therefore, he was booked under Sections 500, 501, 505, 419, 420, 468 IPC and Section 66D of Information Technology Act. It was further submitted that the Prime Minister is the face of the nation before the public at large and saying anything derogatory to him is doing the same to the country, therefore, the Government Counsel argued, the applicant does not deserve any indulgence. On the other hand, the counsel for the applicant submitted that he had been falsely implicated in the present case and that the applicant has nothing to do with the said offence and that there is no criminal history of the applicant.  Lastly, it was argued that the applicant is languishing in jail since October 9, 2021, and he deserves to be released on bail and that if he is released on bail, he would not misuse the liberty of bail and shall cooperate with the trial. Several other submissions were also made in order to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against the applicant. The circumstances which, according to the counsel, led to the false implication of the accused have also been touched upon at length. Having heard the arguments of both the parties, the Court, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, opined that the applicant had made out a case for bail and therefore, the bail application was allowed.    
The Tripura High Court has made it clear that Section 63 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 does not bar the owner of a vehicle seized in raid to make an application seeking interim custody/ bail of his vehicle after expiry of thirty days from the date of seizure.Justice Arindam Lodh observed: "The proviso of sub-section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS Act is... The Tripura High Court has made it clear that Section 63 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 does not bar the owner of a vehicle seized in raid to make an application seeking interim custody/ bail of his vehicle after expiry of thirty days from the date of seizure. Justice Arindam Lodh observed:  "The proviso of sub-section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS Act is relevant to decide the issue raised by learned counsels appearing for the parties. A bare reading of the said proviso makes it aptly clear that an order of confiscation of an article or thing shall be made after expiry of one month from the date of seizure. In other words, an order of confiscation of any article or thing cannot be made by the court within one month from the date of seizure i.e. the court may pass an order of confiscation after expiry of one month. In the opinion of this court, the said proviso of sub-section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS Act does not contemplate that the owner of the said vehicle cannot file an application for releasing his/her vehicle after expiry of one month."  The Special Court had cited the case of Kishan Singh Vrs. State of Tripura to refuse interim custody of vehicle to the Petitioner herein. In the said case, it was held that there is a right to the owner who claimed "within 30 days" from the day of seizure, his title over the vehicle to have interim custody of the said vehicle subject to the adequate security till completion of the trial. The High Court noted that the Special Court had misconstrued the aforesaid precedent. It noted, "What the court has meant to say, that, in case no owner comes forward to claim the ownership of the vehicle within 30 days, then, the court may pass an order directing the Drug Disposal Committee for disposal of the vehicle by sale. In no way it bars the owner to approach the court and file an application for releasing the vehicle after expiry of 30 days." It held that owner of the vehicle may file an application for bail at any stage of the proceeding or even during the proceeding of confiscation. "Needless to say, to claim the release of vehicle under seizure, the owner of the vehicle must satisfy the necessary conditions as laid down in sub Section (3) of Section 60 of the NDPS Act," Court added. The police had detained and seized Petitioner's TATA Ultra 1518 Truck and recovered huge quantity of contraband articles. Driver of the vehicle was arrested. A case was registered under Section 20(b)(ii)(c)/25 and 29 of the NDPS Act.  The owner of the vehicle filed an application before the Special Judge for releasing the vehicle on bail, but, after expiry of one month. Petitioner argued that Section 63 of the NDPS Act does not contemplate that an owner has to file an application for releasing his vehicle within a period of 30 days from the date of seizure.  The High Court was of view that till today no confiscation proceeding has been initiated, even after expiry of one month from the date of seizure. It held that law does not mandate that a court must make an order of confiscation after expiry of one month from the date of seizure. The law makers have used the word "may" in sub section (2) of Section 63 of the NDPS Act which means that court is not legally bound to pass an order of confiscation in all the cases as a matter of routine. Accordingly, the Court directed to release the petitioner's vehicle and quashed Special Judge's order, subject to furnishing a bail bond of Rs.ten lakh with two local sureties. The owner has been directed to keep the vehicle in good condition, to not transfer the vehicle, modify or change its nature and character till disposal of the case and to produce the vehicle as and when directed by the prosecution or by the court.  Case Title : Shri Bal Krishna Mishra v The State of Tripura   
Hearing a bail plea of a rape accused, who is also facing charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the Delhi High Court has directed the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to furnish details of the victim's date of birth as per the records relating to her Aadhar card. The court passed the order after the accused claimed that the prosecutrix, as per the copy of Aadhar card in his possession, was major on the alleged date of incident. The claim was opposed by the State. Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta said the investigating agency as well as the Special Court during the course of trial have a duty to ascertain or determine and satisfy itself to the age of the victim considering the fact that trial under provisions of POCSO Act places presumption and existence of mental state under Section 29 and 30 of the Act. "The proper determination of the age of the victim is important from jurisdictional perspective which determines the applicability of provisions of POCSO Act. It is imperative that the law operates in a balanced manner to ensure that the rights of the victim child are protected under the provisions of POCSO Act and at the same time, it is of paramount importance that the accused is not forced to face the trial under the rigorous provisions of POCSO Act which provides for stringent punishment, in case the victim happens to be a major on the date of the incident," said the court The court further noted that Sub-section (2) of Section 34 of the POCSO Act also requires the Special Court to satisfy itself about the age of child and record in writing its reasons for arriving at a conclusion in this regard.  "The aforesaid objectives need to be kept in perspective even at the stage of bail or charge," it added. The observations were made while dealing with a bail plea filed by a man accused of raping a minor girl last year. FIR against him was registered under Sections 363, 366, 376 and 506 of IPC and section 6 of the POCSO Act.  Considering the claims regarding victim's age, the court on July 27 had said it was imperative that the particulars of the date of birth of prosecutrix/victim entered in Aadhar Card be confirmed by UIDAI. However, on November 1, the APP as well as the counsel representing UIDAI told the court that specific orders need to be passed by this Court in terms of Section 33 (1) of the Aadhar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 in case correct particulars are to be ascertained and shared by authority. While the counsel representing the victim said he has no objection for verification of the DoB, the ascertainment of correct date of birth of the victim as per her Aadhar Card was vehemently opposed by accused's counsel by placing reliance on a recent order passed by a coordinate bench in Hanzla Iqbal v. The State & Anr. In that case, the court had granted bail to an accused in a POCSO case observing that "the person, who is in a consensual physical relationship with another person, is not required to judicially scrutinise the date of birth of the other person. He is not required to see Aadhar card, PAN card and verify the date of birth from her school record before he enters into a physical relationship." Justice Mendiratta observed that the objections raised by the accused's counsel appear to be "completely misplaced", as ascertaining the correct date of birth of the victim is "imperative to ensure that the trial proceeds in the correct direction." "The authority cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner is distinguishable on facts as it never involved the issue of two dates of birth being claimed in respect of the same document. The date of birth furnished in one of the copies of Aadhar Card could be correct while the other would be fake, until and unless the same is explainable on any other hypothesis, since the cards are updated in case of a child after a period of five years, as clarified by learned counsel appearing for UIDAI," the court noted. Seeking details from the UIDAI on the minor victim's date of birth, the court listed the matter for hearing next on January 1, 2023.  Title: VIPIN SINGH v. STATE AND ANR.    
The Supreme Court, in an order passed last week, rejected an interpretation that if the personal search is vitiated by violation of Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the recovery made otherwise also would stand vitiated."We cannot give such an extended view", the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said while dismissing an appeal filed by an accused who was concurrently (by... The Supreme Court, in an order passed last week, rejected an interpretation that if the personal search is vitiated by violation of Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the recovery made otherwise also would stand vitiated. "We cannot give such an extended view", the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said while dismissing an appeal filed by an accused who was concurrently (by the Trial Court and Chhattisgarh High Court) convicted under Section 20(b)(ii)(c) of the NDPS Act. The accused was found carrying Ganja in a green polythene bag on a wooden Kanwad from Bhaisabeda to Pithapur for transportation.  In appeal before the Apex Court, the accused relied on State of Rajasthan v. Parmanand & Anr. – (2014) 5 SCC 345, and State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh – 1999 (6) SCC 172. In these judgments, it is held that if a search is made by an empowered Officer on prior information without informing the person of his right that he has to be taken before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate for search and in case he so opts, failure to take his search accordingly would render the recovery of the illicit article suspicious and vitiate the conviction and sentence of the accused where the conviction has been recorded only the on basis of possession of illicit articles recovered from his person. The third option stated to be given to the accused to get himself searched from the Officer concerned not being part of the statute, the same could not have been offered to the appellant and thus, the recovery from him is vitiated, the court noted. However, the court noticed that the recovery was in a polythene bag which was being carried on a Kanwad and was not in person.  "Learned counsel seeks to expand the scope of the observations made by seeking to contend that if the personal search is vitiated by violation of Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the recovery made otherwise also would stand vitiated and thus, cannot be relied upon. We cannot give such an extended view as is sought to be contended by learned counsel for the appellant.", the court said while dismissing the appeal. In State Of Punjab vs. Baljinder Singh, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court had observed that merely because there was non-compliance of Section 50 as far as "personal search" of the accused was concerned, no benefit can be extended so as to invalidate the effect of recovery from the search of the vehicle. Another three judge bench in Sk. Raju @ Abdul Haque @ Jagga had held that 'as soon as the search of a person takes place, the requirement of mandatory compliance with Section 50 is attracted, irrespective of whether contraband is recovered from the person of the detainee or not.'    
The Madras High Court has held that only senior citizens/ parents are entitled to file an appeal against an order passed by the Tribunal under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizen Act, 2007.

The Madras High Court has held that only senior citizens/ parents are entitled to file an appeal against an order passed by the Tribunal under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizen Act, 2007.  Holding thus, a Division Bench comprising of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy dismissed a petition seeking a declaration that any aggrieved party to an order passed under the Act can file an appeal under Section 16.  It observed,  "When the clear words of a statute do not permit any other meaning or interpretation, particularly when it pertains to a right of appeal, additional words cannot be read into the provision to discover a right in favour of a class of persons excluded by necessary implication in the appellate provision."  Specifically, with respect to the language employed under Section 16, the Bench said,  "When the words used in Section 16 of the Act are "Any senior citizen or a parent ... aggrieved by order of a Tribunal may ... prefer an appeal..." and the other words govern the time or describe the senior citizens or the parent in the alternative, there is no room to imagine that others aggrieved by an order of the tribunal may also prefer an appeal on the ground that the scales must be balanced between the two sides."  Perfectly simple provision need not be twisted  At the outset, the Bench observed that the instant petition has been filed without any basis. "A perfectly simple provision lucidly enunciated is sought to be twisted to imply something that it clearly does not permit," it observed.  It noted that sub-section 1 of Section 16 permits only any senior citizen or a parent, who is aggrieved by an order of a tribunal passed under such Act, to prefer an appeal to the appellate tribunal.  "The words used in the provision are lucid and, by no stretch of imagination, can such clear words of the statute be read or understood or interpreted to imply that any class of persons other than any senior citizen or a parent may be entitled to prefer an appeal under such provision," it thus observed.  Disagreement with Punjab & Haryana High Court  During the course of hearing, the Court's attention was drawn to the case of Paramjit Kumar Saroya v. Union of India, AIR 2014 P&H 121. Therein, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had held that Section 16(1) must be read to provide for the right of appeal to any of the affected parties.  The Division Bench in the instant case was not persuaded by the above findings and thus, expressed its respectful disagreement.  Right to Appeal not inherent but creature of a statute  The Division Bench said that it is a settled law that an appeal is a creature of a statute and no right of appeal inheres in any person unless such right is expressly conferred by any statute.   It observed,  "It is possible for a right of appeal to be hedged with conditions or even a right of appeal to be granted to a class of persons and not granted to another. It is the wisdom of the legislature to decide what classes of persons would be entitled to the right of appeal and what conditions may be attached to the exercise of such right and how such right may be exercised."

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that the advocates are the officers of the Court and deserve the same respect and dignity as is being given to the Judicial Officers and Presiding Officers of the Courts. Justice Sanjay Dhar observed: "Bench and Bar are two wheels of the chariot of justice. Both are equal and no one is superior to the other. The members of the Bar, as such, deserve the utmost respect and dignity." The court was hearing a plea wherein the petitioners had challenged the order passed by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar, whereby transfer application filed by the petitioners for transfer of case under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act from the Court of Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (2nd Additional Munsiff), Srinagar to any other Court of competent jurisdiction in District Srinagar, had been declined. In their plea the petitioners alleged that the DV case was absolutely false and frivolous and when the petitioners approached the trial Magistrate for modification of the order passed by it, the said application was not decided despite a number of requests. The petitioners further submitted that the remarks of the trial Magistrate against the petitioners have not been in good taste being abusive in nature, which compelled them to approach the Chief Judicial Magistrate Srinagar with an application for transfer of the case from the Court of trial Magistrate to any other court of competent jurisdiction.  Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that though the main grouse of the petitioners is that their application for modification or vacation of order passed by the trial Magistrate ex-parte, is not being considered on its merits expeditiously, however it also appears that there has been some exchange of harsh words between the counsel for the petitioners and the Magistrate, which forced the petitioners to approach the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Srinagar seeking transfer of proceedings from the Court of trial Magistrate. The bench noted that the Chief Judicial Magistrate has, vide the impugned order, rightly declined to transfer the proceedings but, while doing so, the Chief Judicial Magistrate has made certain sweeping remarks against the advocates by stating that the advocates level unnecessary allegations against the Judicial Officers in order to facilitate their personal convenience. Addressing the controversy at hand the bench observed that merely because the Magistrate has failed to dispose of the application of the petitioners, is not a ground to transfer the case. It is also not a ground for transfer of a case if there is exchange of some hot words between the Court and the counsel and thus the decision of Chief Judicial Magistrate Srinagar to decline the transfer of the matter from the trial Magistrate, is legally correct and cannot be interfered with, Justice Dhar underscored. The Judge however added that the sweeping remarks made by the CJM against the advocates were uncalled for and unnecessary for the decision of the case.  "There may be stray incidents where the advocates have resorted to levelling of allegations against the Judicial Officers in order to seek transfer of their cases from one Court to other to suit their convenience, but then this cannot be generalized...There may be some rotten apples in the profession, as is true of every profession, but to say that the advocates generally adopt these tactics is not the correct position," concluded the court while expunging the remarks of CJM Srinagar but upholding his order of declining the transfer of case.

The grant of leave to defend (with or without conditions) is the ordinary rule; and denial of leave to defend is an exception, the Supreme Court observed in a judgment in which it discussed the scope of Rule 3 of Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908.The bench comprising Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari observed that a prayer for leave to defend is to be denied in... The grant of leave to defend (with or without conditions) is the ordinary rule; and denial of leave to defend is an exception, the Supreme Court observed in a judgment in which it discussed the scope of Rule 3 of Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. The bench comprising Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari  observed that a prayer for leave to defend is to be denied in such cases where the defendant has practically no defence and is unable to give out even a semblance of triable issues before the Court. ORDER XXXVII of the Code deals with Summary Procedure and Rule 3 thereof contains the procedure for the appearance of defendant. According to the said Rule, the defendants who enters appearance has to seek leave to defend such suit, and leave to defend may be granted to him unconditionally or upon such terms as may appear to the court or judge to be just. It also states that the leave to defend shall not be refused unless the court is satisfied that the facts disclosed by the defendant do not indicate that he has a substantial defence to raise or that the defence intended to be put up by the defendant is frivolous or vexatious: In this case, the plaintiff filed the subject (summary) suit in terms of Order XXXVII CPC while stating itself to be a registered partnership firm manufacturing and supplying a wide variety of iron and steel products. The defendant No. 1 sought leave to defend with the following contentions, inter alia, that it had no privity of contract with the plaintiff because the purchase orders were issued only by the defendant No. 2; that the invoices in question were raised by the plaintiff in the name of the defendant No. 2; that neither the purchase orders nor the invoices were bearing the signatures of the defendant No. 1; and that all the dealings were between plaintiff and defendant No. 2, where no legal liability was to be discharged by defendant No. 1 and that the defendant No. 1 was rather a stranger to the contract in question. The 2nd defendant also filed a similar application seeking leave to defend. The Trial Court declined leave to defend to both the defendants observing that no triable issues were raised by the defendants. The High Court dismissed the appeal filed against this order. The issues thus raised before the Apex Court in this appeal were (1) whether the plaintiff was entitled to maintain a summary suit under Order XXXVII CPC for the claim in question; and (2) whether the appellant-defendant No. 2 has rightly been declined the leave to defend? Regarding the first issue, the bench noted that as per the plaint averment, the matter is based on written contract arising out of written purchase orders issued by the appellant on the instructions and on behalf of defendant No. 1; and the plaintiff had raised the invoices against such supplies under the purchase orders. Therefore, the contention against maintainability of the summary suit in terms of Order XXXVII CPC was rejected. Referring to the Rule and also the judgments in Mechelec Engineers and Manufacturers v. Basic Equipment Corporation: AIR 1977 SC 577 and IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd. v. Hubtown Ltd.: (2017) 1 SCC 56, the court made the following observations: Grant of leave to defend (with or without conditions) is the ordinary rule; and denial of leave to defend is an exception. It is at once clear that even though in the case of IDBI Trusteeship, this Court has observed that the principles stated in paragraph 8 of Mechelec Engineers' case shall stand superseded in the wake of amendment of Rule 3 of Order XXXVII but, on the core theme, the principles remain the same that grant of leave to defend (with or without conditions) is the ordinary rule; and denial of leave to defend is an exception. Putting it in other words, generally, the prayer for leave to defend is to be denied in such cases where the defendant has practically no defence and is unable to give out even a semblance of triable issues before the Court. Trial Court is expected to balance the requirements of expeditious disposal of commercial causes on one hand and of not shutting out triable issues by unduly severe orders on the other As noticed, if the defendant satisfies the Court that he has substantial defence, i.e., a defence which is likely to succeed, he is 18 entitled to unconditional leave to defend. In the second eventuality, where the defendant raises triable issues indicating a fair or bonafide or reasonable defence, albeit not a positively good defence, he would be ordinarily entitled to unconditional leave to defend. In the third eventuality, where the defendant raises triable issues, but it remains doubtful if the defendant is raising the same in good faith or about genuineness of the issues, the Trial Court is expected to balance the requirements of expeditious disposal of commercial causes on one hand and of not shutting out triable issues by unduly severe orders on the other. Therefore, the Trial Court may impose conditions both as to time or mode of trial as well as payment into the Court or furnishing security. In the fourth eventuality, where the proposed defence appear to be plausible but improbable, heightened conditions may be imposed as to the time or mode of trial as also of payment into the Court or furnishing security or both, which may extend to the entire principal sum together with just and requisite interest. Even in such cases of doubts or reservations, denial of leave to defend is not the rule Thus, it could be seen that in the case of substantial defence, the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave; and even in the case of a triable issue on a fair and reasonable defence, the defendant is ordinarily entitled to unconditional leave to defend. In case of doubts about the intent of the defendant or genuineness of the triable issues as also the probability of defence, the leave could yet be granted but while imposing conditions as to the time or mode of trial or payment or furnishing security. Thus, even in such cases of doubts or reservations, denial of leave to defend is not the rule; but appropriate conditions may be imposed while granting the leave. It is only in the case where the defendant is found to be having no substantial defence and/or raising no genuine triable issues coupled with the Court's view that the defence is frivolous or vexatious that the leave to defend is to be refused and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment forthwith. Of course, in the case where any part of the amount claimed by the plaintiff is admitted by the defendant, leave to defend is not to be granted unless the amount so admitted is deposited by the defendant in the Court.  Denying the leave would be ordinarily countenanced only in such cases where the defendant fails to show any genuine triable issue and the Court finds the defence to be frivolous or vexatious. Therefore, while dealing with an application seeking leave to defend, it would not be a correct approach to proceed as if denying the leave is the rule or that the leave to defend is to be granted only in exceptional cases or only in cases where the defence would appear to be a meritorious one. Even in the case of raising of triable issues, with the defendant indicating his having a fair or reasonable defence, he is ordinarily entitled to unconditional leave to defend unless there be any strong reason to deny the leave. It gets perforce reiterated that even if there remains a reasonable doubt about the probability of defence, sterner or higher conditions as stated above could be imposed while granting leave but, denying the leave would be ordinarily countenanced only in such cases where the defendant fails to show any genuine triable issue and the Court finds the defence to be frivolous or vexatious. Examining the factual aspects of the case, the bench found that that the appellant defendant raised triable issues, particularly  concerning its liability and thus the defence of the appellant cannot be said to be frivolous or vexatious altogether. Allowing the appeal, the court granted leave to defend to the appellant-defendant.    Appearances :  For appellants - Mr. Jayant K. Mehta, Sr. Adv. Mr. Abhimanyu Mahajan, Adv.

The Supreme Court reiterated that an appeal under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act against orders of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal lies only before the High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the assessing officer is located. As per Section 260A of IT Act, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every order passed in appeal by the Appellate Tribunal before the date of establishment of the National Tax Tribunal, if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. In this case, the appeal under Section 260A was filed before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The High Court directed the appellant to present the appeal before the High Court of Gujarat as the Assessing Officer who passed the order was located at Surat within the State of Gujarat. Before the Apex Court, the petitioner pointed out the recent decision in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax-I, Chandigarh v. ABC Papers Ltd. (2022) 9 SCC 1, in which it was held as follows:  "45. In conclusion, we hold that appeals against every decision of ITAT shall lie only before the High Court within whose jurisdiction the assessing officer who passed the assessment order is situated. Even if the case or cases of an assessee are transferred in exercise of power under Section 127 of the Act, the High Court within whose jurisdiction the assessing officer has passed the order, shall continue to exercise the jurisdiction of appeal. This principle is applicable even if the transfer is under Section 127 for the same assessment year(s)." Commenting on the submission that the High Court of Gujarat has taken a contrary view, the bench observed: "We need only mention that any contrary view which has been taken cannot survive after the authoritative announcement by this Court in the decision we have referred to."

The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently ruled that the bail granted cannot be cancelled under Section 439(2) of Code of Criminal Procedure if there are vague allegations against the accused without any substantive proof.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently ruled that the bail granted cannot be cancelled under Section 439(2) of Code of Criminal Procedure if there are vague allegations against the accused without any substantive proof.  Brief facts of the Case  The criminal petition was filed under Section 439(2), CrPC to cancel the bail that was granted to the accused. It is a case of double murder.  The wife of one of the deceased filed the petition for cancellation of the said bail that was granted to the accused in the above crime on the ground that there were no changes of circumstances for grant of bail after the dismissal of two earlier bail applications. Furthermore, she alleged that the accused through their men have been threatening the witnesses and interfering with the process of investigation and making an attempt to tamper with the prosecution evidence.  The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State submitted that a condition was imposed that the accused would not enter the village and the accused had been complying with the said condition. He also submitted that the entire investigation was completed and about 48 witnesses had been examined and only forensic science report is awaited to file the charge sheet.  Court's Ruling   The court in the present matter observed that in the third bail application which was allowed, the Additional Sessions Judge had noted that some police personnel was deployed in the village as there was threat to the family members of the accused and he further held that since material witnesses were examined, there would be no chance to the accused to interfere with the investigation. On the basis of the stage of investigation, the bail was granted to the accused.  Justice Cheekati Manavendranath Roy relied on Raghubir Singh v. State of Bihar, 1986 where the illustrative instances of when bail can be cancelled were given:  (i) the accused misuses his liberty by indulging in similar criminal activity, (ii) interferes with the course of investigation, (iii) attempts to tamper with evidence or witnesses, (iv) threatens witnesses or indulges in similar activities which would hamper smooth investigation, (v) there is likelihood of his fleeing to another country, (vi) attempts to make himself scarce by going underground or becoming unavailable to the investigating agency and (vii) attempts to place himself beyond the reach of his surety, etc....".  Furthermore, in Myakala Dharmarajam and others v. State of Telangana, 2020, the alleged complaint that accused were influencing witnesses was held to be vague as except making an omnibus allegation to that effect there was no material to substantiate the same and the bail granted was not cancelled.  The court held that the accused making an attempt to threaten the witnesses appeared to be vague allegation without any valid basis. Nothing was brought to the notice of the police or investigating agency that the accused interfered with the course of investigation. The criminal petition was hence dismissed.

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday registered a suo moto Public Interest Litigation for the purpose of vaccinating all persons associated with judicial functioning including Judges, Court Staff and Lawyers, treating them as "frontline workers", on a priority basis, without limitations of their age or physical condition.  Finding weight in the communication made by Delhi Bar Council's Chairman, Mr. Ramesh Gupta, the division bench comprising of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli registered the communication dated 1st March 2021 as a PIL.  "In the light of the aforesaid, prima facie, it appears to us that there is weight in the claim made by the Bar Council of Delhi for declaring all persons associated with the judicial functioning, which includes the Judges, the Court Staff and the lawyers as frontline workers, so that they could receive vaccination on priority, and without limitations of their age or physical condition. We may observe that the co-morbidities enlisted by the Government to accommodate persons falling in the age group of 45 to 60 years, taken note of hereinabove, are serious conditions from which the Judges, the Court staff and Advocates may, or may not, be suffering. Even if, they are not found to be suffering from one of the co-morbidities, it does not mean that the risk of their contracting the disease and suffering serious health issues – including fatality, does not exist." The order reads.  According to the communication of Delhi Bar Council dated 1st March 2021 made to the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, appropriate directions were requested to be issued on the medical and administrative authorities to make available necessary infrastructure including medical dispensaries in Court premises for the purpose of vaccination of judges, court staffs and lawyers by treating them as frontline workers.  Looking at the gravity of the issue and finding merits in the said communication, the division bench observed thus:  "The need of the hour is to vaccinate the masses, in view of the raging Pandemic, on a war footing so as to secure the life and health of all those who step out of their homes to attend to their avocations and professions. Courts, by their very nature, are places which have very high density congregations of people on a daily basis. Hundreds and thousands of cases are listed in any given Court complex every day. Apart from judges, the Court staff – which is substantial, and Advocates – who have to attend to their respective cases, and a large number of litigants visit Courts in which their cases are listed, on a daily basis."  In view of the availability of two vaccines in India, namely Covishield and Covaxin, the Court issued notice to its manufacturer companies Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.  Furthermore, the Court also issued notice to Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India; the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, GNCT of Delhi.  The notices are returnable on 4th March 2021 before the Chief Justice, DN Patel.  [Read Order]

The Tripura High Court has recently held that unless and until there is an explicit challenge to birth documents and school records of a person, a plea for conducting his/ her DNA test cannot be entertained by the Court. Justice T. Amarnath Goud was adjudicating upon a plea wherein the case of the petitioner was that the respondent (Partha Ghosh) was not the son of the deceased Kshitish Ghosh and under the garb of certain wills purportedly executed by the latter, the respondent had been selling the properties which were in dispute before the trial court.  The plea had further prayed for directions to allow the conduct of a DNA test, an application for which had been dismissed earlier.  Refusing to allow the plea for conducting a DNA test, the Court observed,  "Unless and until there is a challenge to the birth documents and school register to show that Kshitish Ghosh is not the father of the first respondent, Partha Ghosh, there cannot be any direction to get the DNA of first respondent tested to declare whether he is the son of the deceased Kshitish Ghosh and Fulu Rani Ghosh or not." During the proceedings, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that the respondent had been disposing of the disputed properties to third parties and that nothing would remain for the petitioners who are siblings if they were to succeed before the trial court. On the other hand, the counsel for the respondent contended that the respondent is the son of the deceased Kshitish Ghosh and his spouse Fulu Rani Ghosh and that all his documents such as school records, birth certificate also indicate so. Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgment in Goutam Kundu v. State of W.B and Another wherein it had been held that blood test needs to be conducted to prove the genuineness of parents. Pursuant to a perusal of the rival submissions, the Court observed that it is not in dispute that the petitioner is aware that all documents of the respondent such as Birth Certificate, School Records, certificate from Revenue Department, Aadhar Card, Ration Card and the certificate issued by the Magistrate all reflect that the respondent is the son of Kshitish Ghosh and Fulu Rani Ghosh. Accordingly, the Court held that the petitioner has to first prefer a challenge to these documents before a plea for DNA testing can be entertained.  The Court further refused to make any observations on the disputed facts and accordingly remarked,  "It is not for this court to go into the disputed question of facts when appropriate remedy is available to the parties. The concern expressed by the petitioners who are the siblings of the deceased that they have the vested right and interest over the properties of their biological brother as legal heirs and nothing remains if the first respondent and his spouse proceeds alienating the properties and create third party interest. It is not for this court to decide this aspect." Accordingly, the Court granted liberty to the petitioner to move applications before the concerned court seeking appropriate remedy in support of their claim to protect the disputed properties.

The Chhattisgarh High Court has held that when the Fundamental Rules  expressly provide for the grant of full pay and allowances on the exoneration of a Government servant from punishment/criminal charges, the principle of 'No Work No Pay' would have no application. Justice Sanjay K. Agrawal remarked that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' would not override sub-rule (2) of Rule 54 of the Fundamental Rules, which provides for full pay and allowances on full exoneration. Background: The petitioner, a Jail Gaurd, was terminated from service by the competent authority. He preferred an appeal before the appellate authority, which was allowed, and he was then reinstated in service.  However, the full pay and allowances from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement was not granted by the appellate authority. This part of order, of not granting full pay and allowances, was called in question by the petitioner in the instant writ petition.  Senior Advocate H.B. Agarwal, appearing for the petitioner, argued that full pay and allowances from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement ought to have been granted to the petitioner in the light of Rule 54 (2) of the Fundamental Rules.  On the other hand, Additional Advocate General Sunil Otwani, appearing for the respondent-State, submitted that the appellate authority had considered the facts and circumstances of the case and rightly held that the petitioner was not entitled to full pay and allowances on the principle of 'No Work No Pay. Findings: The Court noted that Rule 54(2) of the Fundamental Rules entitles the Government servant for full pay and allowances in case of full exoneration. It was noted that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' was based upon a fundamental concept in a Law of Contact of Employment, where wages and salary were paid by the employer in consideration of work/service rendered by the employee. Thus Court added that, " 'No Work No Pay' principle has been laid down keeping in view public interest that a Government servant who does not discharge his duty is not allowed pay and arrears at the cost of public exchequer." Referring to the judgement of the Apex Court in the State of Bihar and Ors. v. Kripa Nand Singh & Anr. where it was observed that 'No Work No Pay' is the rule and 'No Work Yet Pay' is the exception, the Court stated that the exception would apply only when an employee was compelled (compulsory waiting period) not to attend his duty without any violation or any fault on his part. Further reliance was placed on Commissioner Karnataka Housing Board v. C. Muddaiah, where the Supreme Court reiterated that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' was not absolute in a given case, if the person was willing to work but was illegally and unlawfully not allowed to do so; the Court may, in the circumstances, direct the authority to grant him all benefits considering "as if he had worked". After examining the precedents, the Court noted that the principle of 'No Work No Pay' would not be applicable where the rule expressly directed so otherwise, like in the case  sub-rule (2) of Rule 54 of the Fundamental Rules in the instant case.  Accordingly, the part of impugned order of 2010 holding the petitioner to be not entitled for full pay and allowances from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement was set­ aside. The Court thus remitted the matter back to the appellate authority to consider the case of the petitioner for grant of full pay and allowances. Case Title: Rajendra Sharma & Ors v. State of Chhattisgarh & Ors.  Read Order      
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that for arraigning an additional accused during the trial, there has to be much stronger evidence against him than mere probability of his involvement in the crime. The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar in the judgement on a plea challenging the order passed by Additional Special Judge, Anticorruption, Kashmir, Srinagar, whereby the Special Judge, after completion of the examination of prosecution witnesses, in 2012 had directed the Vigilance Organisation to place the record before the competent authority for considering accord of sanction for prosecution against the petitioner - who was a witness in the case, in terms of Section 6 of the J&K Prevention of Corruption Act. The Case The case was registered in 1991 against Dr. Gh. Hassan Khan, the then Block Medical Officer, Bandipora, under Section 5(2) of J&K Prevention of Corruption Act for alleged misappropriation of Rs 30,000 in 1990. Subsequently, a chargesheet was filed against him alleging that the amount has been fraudulently and dishonestly misappropriated by the officer and the officials connected with its drawl and that there were also mutilations or tampering in the drawl register and cash book pertaining to the amount. The petitioner, Nazir Ahmad Ganai, who was a cashier in the health department at the relevant time, was cited as a prosecution witness in the challan. After framing of charges against Khan, when all the prosecution witnesses were examined and the case was set down for recording of statement of the main accused under Section 342 of Cr. P. C (of the erstwhile J&K State), the Special Judge observed that the evidence on record, prima facie, discloses the involvement of PW-9, Cashier Nazir Ahmad Ganai.  It was in these circumstances that the impugned order came to be passed by the learned Special Judge. Challenge Khan challenged the order on the ground that that there is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure or in any other law in existence to array a person as an accused in the pending trial, particularly when the investigating agency, after investigation of the case, had not found any material against the petitioner.  There was no material before the learned Special Judge to seek impleadment of the petitioner as an accused, the court was told. "It is not open to a court to direct the competent authority to accord sanction for prosecution and that once the trial of a case has been completed, it is not open to the court to direct further investigation of the case," his counsel argued. Verdict Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Dhar observed that Section 351 of the J&K Cr. P. C, which is somewhat akin to the provisions contained in Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, empowers a Court to take cognizance of the offence against a person who is in attendance, if there is evidence before the Court that the person is, prima facie, guilty of the said offence.  A person attending a Criminal Court, although not under arrest, can be detained by the Sessions Court for the purpose of inquiry or trial of any offence of which such court takes cognizance, the bench underscored.  "Even a Magistrate, on taking cognizance of the offence which in his opinion has been committed by a person who is not before him and there is sufficient ground for proceeding against him, is empowered to issue process for summoning of such person under Section 204 of Cr. P. C. Section 190(1)(b) of the Cr. P. C does not restrict power of a Magistrate to proceed against an offender merely because in the police report his name is not sent up as an accused," the bench explained.  Deliberating on the degree of satisfaction required for impleading an additional accused, the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations of Supreme Court in Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab, (2014) wherein SC observed:  "The test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to conviction. In the absence of such satisfaction, the court should refrain from exercising power under Section 319 CrPC. In Section 319 CrPC the purpose of providing if "it appears from the evidence that any person not being the accused has committed any offence" is clear from the words "for which such person could be tried together with the accused". The words used are not "for which such person could be convicted". There is, therefore, no scope for the court acting under Section 319 CrPC to form any opinion as to the guilt of the accused."  Applying the said position of law to the instant case, the bench observed that keeping in view the nature of evidence that had come on record during the trial, the Special Judge was well within his jurisdiction to initiate the process for arraying the petitioner as an accused.  "So, no fault can be found in the satisfaction recorded by the learned Special Judge in this regard," said the court. On the argument that it was not open to the learned Special Judge to direct the competent authority to accord sanction for prosecution against the petitioner, the court said there can be no quarrel with the proposition that a Special Judge cannot direct the competent authority to grant sanction against a potential accused. However, it added: "But then in the instant case, the learned Special Judge, by virtue of the impugned order, has not directed the competent authority to grant sanction for prosecution against the petitioner. The learned Special Judge has only directed the Commissioner, Vigilance Organization, to place all the relevant record and the statements of the prosecution witnesses recorded in the case as well Case Diary before the competent authority for considering accord of sanction for prosecution against the petitioner." After perusing a copy of the government sanction, the court said it did not find anything in its contents "that would even remotely suggest that the competent authority has accorded sanction to prosecute the petitioner under the influence or under the directions of the learned Special Judge."  The court also said the Special Judge has not directed the investigating agency to undertake further probe but only made it aware about its powers. "A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the learned Special Judge has carefully worded his order and while noting that investigation in the case is silent on certain aspects, he has left it free to the investigating agency to probe these aspects in terms of Section 173(8) of Cr. P. C," it said. Dismissing the petition, the court said the said order is well reasoned and lucid.  Case Title : Nazir Ahmad Ganai Vs State of J&K.     
The Court explained that a statutory tenant can claim rights only under the Rent Act and not under the TP Act.The Supreme Court has observed that the rights and liabilities of a statutory tenant have to be found under the Rent Act alone and not under Transfer of Property Act.The bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna observed that a statutory tenant cannot seek repossession after the demolition of building under Section 108(B)(e) of the TP Act.In this case, the tenant filed a suit in which... The Supreme Court has observed that the rights and liabilities of a statutory tenant have to be found under the Rent Act alone and not under Transfer of Property Act. The bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna observed that a statutory tenant cannot seek repossession after the demolition of building under Section 108(B)(e) of the TP Act. In this case, the tenant filed a suit in which he claimed mandatory injunction and possession after the building he occupied got demolished in pursuant to proceedings under Section 322 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act. He also filed on another suit claiming damages. The Trial Court decreed the suit and directed to grant quantified damages and to pay Rs. 10,000/- per month till such time, the possession is handed over to the plaintiff. In appeal, the High Court held that the building in question was demolished in haste and the plaintiff was thus entitled to possession of the building as he was unlawfully dispossessed of the same. Before the Apex Court, the plaintiff contended that in spite of demolition of the building by the Corporation, the tenancy rights survive as the right of tenancy is not only in building but also in the land. He relied on the judgment in Shaha Ratansi Khimji and Sons v. Kumbhar Sons Hotel Private Limited holding that in terms of Section 108B(e) of the Transfer of Property Act, 18828 , the destruction of tenanted property would not amount to determination of tenancy under Section 111 of the TP Act. Referring to the said judgment and also the judgments in T. Lakshmipathi & Ors. v. P. Nithyananda Reddy, K. K. Krishnan v. M. K. Vijaya Ragavan, N. Motilal & Ors. v. Faisal Bin Al, the court observed. In view of the binding decisions of the larger bench and keeping in view the fact that the judgment of this Court in Shaha Ratansi Khimji was dealing with the rights of contractual tenant, the statutory tenant cannot seek repossession after the demolition of building under Section 108(B)(e) of the TP Act as the rights and liabilities of a statutory tenant have to be found under the Rent Act alone. The court thus,in this case, observed that, since the premises are situated within the urban areas governed by the Rent Act, the tenant has a right to seek possession only in terms of Section 27 of the Act if the decree for eviction has been passed by a Court on the ground specified under clause (j) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 21. "The plaintiff filed first suit claiming right over the land after demolition of the building but being a statutory tenant, he had to avail the remedy under the Rent Act as the provisions of the TP Act are not applicable to the building and land situated within urban area. In view of the provisions of the Act, the terms of the TP Act cannot be applied for in respect of statutory tenants. The High Court has returned a finding that the plaintiff was a statutory tenant. In view of the said fact, the remedy of the tenant, if any, has to be found within four corners of the Rent Act and not under the TP Act", the bench said while setting aside the High Court judgment and dismissing the suit.

The Gujarat High Court recently quashed an order of the passport authorities impounding the passport of one, Gulamhusen Dadamiya Pir on the ground that he was engaged in some anti-national activities. It is interesting to note that the passport of the petitioner was not impounded by invoking the provisions of Section 10(3)(c) of the Passports Act, 1967, which refers to the impounding of a passport, if the holder of such passport is involved in any activities, which is against the interest of the sovereignty, integrity and the security of India. Rather, the petitioner's passport was impounded under Section 10(3)(h) of the Passports Act, 1967, which refers to the impounding of the passport on the ground of registration of a criminal offence against the passport holder. The bench of Justice A. S. Supehia observed that neither any material suggesting the involvement of the petitioner in any anti-national activities had been produced before the High Court nor any material indicating that any criminal offence had been registered against the petitioner had been produced by the respondents. "The impugned order dated 03.09.2020 refers to the provisions of Section 10 (3) (h) of the Passports Act, 1967. Since no material has been produced by the respondent authorities that the petitioner has been involved in any criminal offence despite a specific statement made by him in the writ-petition in this regard, the invocation of the aforesaid provision by the impugned order dated 03.09.2020 is misconceived and misdirected. Hence, the impugned orders require to be quashed and set aside," the Court held. The case involved the impounding of the passport of petitioner Gulamhusen. He was asked to surrender the passport in Feb 2017, which he did. Thereafter, he moved to the HC for directions to authorities seeking the return of his passport, and he was asked to make a fresh application for the return of his passport before the concerned authorities and the respondent authorities were directed to decide the same in accordance with law.  When he made an application, the passport authorities asked him to give an undertaking that he would provide information about criminal cases, if filed against him. He gave an undertaking that no criminal case had been registered against him, despite this fact, his passport was not released. Subsequently, in September 2020, the passport office wrote to Gulamhusen informing him that his passport was impounded on grounds that he was involved in anti-national activities. Challenging the same, Gulamhusen moved the court again and when the High court sough evidence in that regard, the respondent authorities could not provide any details about his involvement in any anti-national activity. In view of this, the Court quashed and set aside the order of the passport authorities. The respondents were directed to release the passport of the petitioner within a period of one month.

The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Tuesday, issued guidelines to make criminal justice system more disabled-friendly.The testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability, or of a disabled witness for that matter, cannot be considered weak or inferior, only because such an individual interacts with the world in a different manner, vis-à-vis their able-bodied counterparts, the... The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Tuesday, issued guidelines to make criminal justice system more disabled-friendly. The testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability, or of a disabled witness for that matter, cannot be considered weak or inferior, only because such an individual interacts with the world in a different manner, vis-à-vis their able-bodied counterparts, the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed. While changes in the law on the books mark a significant step forward, much work still needs to be done in order to ensure that their fruits are realized by those for whose benefit they were brought, the bench said while issuing following guidelines. The National Judicial Academy and state judicial academies are requested to sensitize trial and appellate judges to deal with cases involving survivors of sexual abuse. This training should acquaint judges with the special provisions, concerning such survivors, such as those outlined above. It should also cover guidance on the legal weight to be attached to the testimony of such witnesses/survivors, consistent with our holding above. Public prosecutors and standing counsel should also undergo similar training in this regard. The Bar Council of India can consider introducing courses in the LL.B program that cover these topics and the intersectional nature of violence more generally;Trained special educators and interpreters must be appointed to ensure the effective realization of the reasonable accommodations embodied in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013. All police stations should maintain a database of such educators, interpreters and legal aid providers, in order to facilitate easy access and coordination; The National Crimes Record Bureau should seriously consider the possibility of maintaining disaggregated data on gender-based violence. Disability must be one of the variables on the basis of which such data must be maintained so that the scale of the problem can be mapped out and tailored remedial action can be taken;Police officers should be provided sensitization, on a regular basis, to deal with cases of sexual violence against women with disabilities, in an appropriate way. The training should cover the full life cycle of a case involving a disabled survivor, from enabling them to register complaints, obtain necessary accommodations, medical attention and suitable legal representation. This training should emphasize the importance of interacting directly with the disabled person concerned, as opposed to their care-taker or helper, in recognition of their agency; andAwareness-raising campaigns must be conducted, in accessible formats, to inform women and girls with disabilities, about their rights when they are at the receiving end of any form of sexual abuse. Background The bench was considering the appeal filed by the sole accused tried for the offences punishable under Section 376(1) of the IPC and under Section 3(2)(v) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for committing rape on the victim girl who is aged about 20 years and blind by birth, on 31.03.2011 at about 9:30 AM in her house. The High Court had affirmed the conviction of the accused by the Trial Court on these charges. Legal personhood of persons with disabilities cannot be premised on societal stereotypes of their supposed "inferiority" The court noted that, in this case, the defense sought to cast doubt on the testimony of the prosecutrix by arguing that she would have been unable to identify the accused due to her disability.   Referring to a judgment in Mange v. State of Haryana [AIR 1979 SC 1194], the court said that there have been instances where the testimony of a disabled prosecutrix has not been considered seriously and treated at an equal footing as that of their able-bodied counterparts. "One such instance is the judgment of this Court in Mange v. State of Haryana , where the testimony of a thirteen year-old girl who was deaf and mute was not recorded and the conviction was confirmed on the account of an eye witness and supported by medical evidence. This Court in affirming the conviction noted that the non-examination of the prosecutrix was not a major infirmity in the prosecution's case "apart from being a child witness, she was also deaf and dumb and no useful purpose would have been served by examining her." We are of the considered view that presumptions of such nature which construe disability as an incapacity to participate in the legal process reflect not only an inadequate understanding of how disability operates but may also result in a miscarriage of justice through a devaluation of crucial testimonies given by persons with disabilities. The legal personhood of persons with disabilities cannot be premised on societal stereotypes of their supposed "inferiority", which is an affront to their dignity and a negation of the principle of equality......This kind of a judicial attitude stems from and perpetuates the underlying bias and stereotypes against persons with disabilities. We are of the view that the testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability, or of a disabled witness for that matter, cannot be considered weak or inferior, only because such an individual interacts with the world in a different manner, vis-a-vis their able-bodied counterparts. As long as the testimony of such a witness otherwise meets the criteria for inspiring judicial confidence, it is entitled to full legal weight. It goes without saying that the court appreciating such testimony needs to be attentive to the fact that the witness' disability can have the consequence of the testimony being rendered in a different form, relative to that of an able-bodied witness. In the case at hand, for instance, PW2's blindness meant that she had no visual contact with the world. Her primary mode of identifying those around her, therefore, is by the sound of their voice. And so PW2's testimony is entitled to equal weight as that of a prosecutrix who would have been able to visually identify the appellant."  The court finally set aside the conviction of the accused under Section 3(2)(v) of the SC and ST Act but upheld the conviction and life sentence punishable under Section 376 IPC.           
In a notable judgment explaining the concept of 'cause of action' under Article 226(2) of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court held that only those facts, which are relevant to the grant of the relief, will give rise to 'cause of action'.  Applying this principle, the Court held that a company cannot challenge a GST notification issued by one state before a High Court located in another State only on the ground that it has office there.  The Supreme Court was considering the appeals filed by the State of Goa against a decision of the Sikkim High Court that it has jurisdiction to entertain a petition filed by a company challenging the notification issued by the Goa Government. The writ petition was filed by a lottery company challenging a notification issued by the Goa Government under the GST Act. The petitioner claimed that a part of the cause of action had arisen in Sikkim and hence the Sikkim High Court has jurisdiction to decide the matter. The High Court held the writ petitions as maintainable on the ground that the petitioners are also challenging a notification issued by the Centre under the CGST Act. Although State of Goa filed an application for its deletion from the array of respondents, the High Court refused to do so, against which the State appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court noted that there is no pleading in the writ petition as to how the cause of action has arisen in Sikkim, except a statement that both the petitioners and the respondents are located within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. In this context, the Court delved into the meaning of the word "cause of action" and referred to the classic definition in Cooke vs. Gill -"cause of action means every fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the court".  Guiding tests to determine cause of action The Court said that in the context of a writ petition, what would constitute such ‘cause of action’ is the material facts which are imperative for the writ petitioner to plead and prove to obtain relief as claimed. Such pleaded facts must have a nexus with the subject matter of challenge based on which the prayer can be granted. Those facts which are not relevant or germane for grant of the prayer would not give rise to a cause of action conferring jurisdiction on the court.  Here, tax has been levied by the Government of Goa in respect of a business that the petitioning company is carrying on within the territory of Goa. Such tax is payable by the petitioning company not in respect of carrying on of any business in the territory of Sikkim. The immediate civil consequence, if at all, arising from the impugned notification is that the petitioning company has to pay tax @ 14% to the Government of Goa. The liability arises for the specific nature of business carried on by the petitioning company within the territory of Goa. The pleadings do not reflect that any adverse consequence of the impugned notification has been felt within the jurisdiction of the Sikkim High Court "Here, tax has been levied by the Government of Goa in respect of a business that the petitioning company is carrying on within the territory of Goa. Such tax is payable by the petitioning company not in respect of carrying on of any business in the territory of Sikkim", a bench comprising Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta observed. "Hence, merely because the petitioning company has its office in Gangtok, Sikkim, the same by itself does not form an integral part of the cause of action authorizing the petitioning company to move the High Court", the bench added.  Concept of forum conveniens Even if a part of cause of action is assumed to have arisen within the State of Sikkim, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ having regard to the principle of forum conveniens. "As held by this Court in Kusum Ingots Vs. Union of India and Ambica Industries Vs. CCE, even if a small part of the cause of action arises within the territorial jurisdiction of a high court, the same by itself could not have been a determinative factor compelling the High Court to keep the writ petitions alive against the appellant to decide the matter qua the impugned notification, on merit". The Court held that the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petitions as against the State of Goa. Case Title : State of Goa vs Summit Online Trade Solutions (P) Ltd and others Constitution of India - Article 226(2) - Guiding tests to determine whether part of cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of a High Court- In the context of a writ petition, what would constitute such ‘cause of action’ is the material facts which are imperative for the writ petitioner to plead and prove to obtain relief as claimed- Determination of the question as to whether the facts pleaded constitute a part of the cause of action, sufficient to attract clause (2) of Article 226 of the Constitution, would necessarily involve an exercise by the high court to ascertain that the facts, as pleaded, constitute a material, essential or integral part of the cause of action - In so determining, it is the substance of the matter that is relevant- It, therefore, follows that the party invoking the writ jurisdiction has to disclose that the integral facts pleaded in support of the cause of action do constitute a cause empowering the high court to decide the dispute and that, at least, a part of the cause of action to move the high court arose within its jurisdiction- Such pleaded facts must have a nexus with the subject matter of challenge based on which the prayer can be granted- Those facts which are not relevant or germane for grant of the prayer would not give rise to a cause of action conferring jurisdiction on the court - Para 15 Constitution of India - Article 226(2) - Tax has been levied by the Government of Goa in respect of a business that the petitioning company is carrying on within the territory of Goa- Such tax is payable by the petitioning company not in respect of carrying on of any business in the territory of Sikkim- Merely because the petitioning company has its office in Gangtok, Sikkim, the same by itself does not form an integral part of the cause of action authorizing the petitioning company to move the High Court- Para 16 Constitution of India - Article 226(2) -Concept of forum conveniens- Even if a small part of the cause of action arises within the territorial jurisdiction of a high court, the same by itself could not have been a determinative factor compelling the High Court to keep the writ petitions alive against the appellant to decide the matter qua the impugned notification, on merit - Para 18

While denying bail to 4 persons accused of fraudulently withdrawing money from the bank account of a retired High Court Judge, the Allahabad High Court today observed that those who deposit money in banks are honest and it is the responsibility of the banks to keep their money safe 'at any cost'. The Bench of Justice Shekhar Yadav also observed that those people who do not deposit crores of rupees in the bank and rather hide the same in the basements of their houses, are responsible for hollowing out the economic prosperity of the country. Opining that the bank has to take responsibility for such cases wherein the money of their customers is withdrawn by cybercriminals as such customers are more honest towards the country since they put their white money in banks. "Bank account holders' money should be safe. Not only because the customer deposits money in the bank so that he/she can withdraw it when needed, but also because the money deposited by the customers in the bank is white and due to which, the economic condition of the country also improves. On the other hand, there are people in the country who do not deposit crores of rupees in the bank and keep it hidden in the basements of their houses. The banks do not get any benefit from it, and they also hollow out the economic condition of the country. In such a situation, that customer of the bank is more honest towards the country and his money should be kept safe by the bank at all costs and if in any way the money is withdrawn by cybercriminals, then for this, the bank has to take responsibility for it," the Court opined. The case in brief  The Court was dealing with the bail plea of 4 accused in connection with a case, wherein money was fraudulently withdrawn from the bank account of a Judge (retired), High Court. Essentially, 5 lacs rupees was withdrawn from the account of retired HC Judge Justice Poonam Srivastava. the matter was probed and 3 accused were arrested from Jamtara in Jharkhand. Thereafter, they moved the court by way of filing bail pleas and opposed the charges against them. In June 2021, during the course of the hearing of this matter, the Allahabad High Court had observed that the police authorities are not making serious efforts in controlling these types of fraudulent activities. Again in August 2021, expressing concerns over the spreading nationwide network of cyber thugs, the Allahabad High Court had observed that cyber thugs are eating up the entire country like termites and are responsible for the weakening of the economic condition in the country. The Bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav had further observed that it was necessary to fix the accountability in such matters so that the money of the people, who have been victims of cyber fraud, is not lost. The Court had also sought the response of the Union, State & Reserve Bank of India on the question as to how to make Banks & Police accountable in online/cyber fraud cases. Submission made by the concerned parties During the subsequent case hearings, RBI argued before the Court that it warns bank customers to be aware of such frauds and not fall in the trap of cyber thugs. The Centre submitted before the Court that the entire case of fraudulent withdrawal of bank customers is related to the Reserve Bank and only they are responsible for it.  It was further suggested by him that the banks can keep an eye on the account of all the customers through the Aadhar card-bank linking, however, however, he added that Supreme Court has abolished the mandatory linking of the Aadhar cards with bank accounts. Significantly, the Court expressed its agreement with the argument made by the Union of India to file a review petition against the Supreme Court's 2018 Adhaar Verdict wherein the Court had held that the move of mandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank account does not satisfy the test of proportionality. "The court agrees with the contention of Shri S.P.Sing that he should file a review petition in the Supreme Court regarding the mandatory linking of the Aadhar card so that the Aadhar card could be linked with the bank account holders and online bank fraud can be prevented," the Court said. Further, it was suggested by the advocate appearing on behalf of BSNL that since mobile sims are being sold for free or for very little money and without any strict rules, there has been an increase in online crimes, hence mobile sim Selling companies should first deposit the security money while selling the SIM cars. Secondly, he added, the SIM cards should be issued only after getting the address given in the original identity card verified and contended that when the strict rules would be made, then only cybercrime can be curbed. Lastly, the State Government argued before the Court that there has been an increase in cybercrime in recent times and that online crime is happening all over the country, and the Counsels representing the UP Govt also expressed concerns and said that there is hardly any person left who has not been a victim of cyber fraud.  Agaisnt this backdrop, it was contended by them that the Government of India and the State Government should devise such a system that such crimes could be stopped. It was also suggested by him that the security of the customers' money should be guaranteed.  It was their submission that since the money is deposited in the bank, therefore, it is the responsibility of the bank to devise such a system that the money of the customers in its bank does not go into the hands of cyber-criminals under any circumstances and the banks should make every effort to stop it. "The bank should open the account in its bank only after performing a complete verification of mobile number and address...at the time of online money transfer, the concerned banks should verify the transaction by calling their customers personally and then only transfer the money," the state counsels concluded by arguing thus.    
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that when dealing with a case registered under the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the power to grant regular bail under Section 439 CrPC is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act. Power to grant bail under Section 439 of the Code is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37... The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that when dealing with a case registered under the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the power to grant regular bail under Section 439 CrPC is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act.  Power to grant bail under Section 439 of the Code is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which commences with non-obstante clause.  Section 37 of NDPS Act stipulates that every offence punishable under the Act shall be cognizable and no person accused of offences involving commercial quantity shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless (i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release, and (ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. The bench comprising Justice Suvir Sehgal further added that the Court needs to see whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offence has not been committed by the accused and whether he is likely to commit any offence while he will be on bail.   The accused herein was arrested following recovery of 35,000 tablets of intoxicating substance from the vehicle being driven by him. Besides urging that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the FIR, counsel for the petitioner has argued that there is violation in compliance of Sections 42 and 50 of the NDPS Act. By referring to the recovery memo, counsel submitted that it carries the details of the FIR, which shows that the entire search is tainted. It has also been contended that the patrolling party was travelling in a private vehicle and there is an infraction of the instructions issued by the Govt. The State on the other hand argued that as the contraband falls within the category of commercial quantity, the petitioner cannot be enlarged on bail in view of the bar under Section 37 of the NDPS Act. After placing reliance on the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India through NCB, Lucknow Vs. Md. Nawaz Khan (2021) 10 SCC 100, the court held that the arguments of the counsel for the petitioner regarding non-compliance of the procedure and instructions will be a subject matter of trial.  Insofar as allegations against the petitioner are concerned, the court held that no explanation has been provided by the petitioner for the commercial quantity of contraband that has been recovered from his possession. Therefore, bar which is laid down under Section 37 of the NDPS Act is attracted in the instant case.  As far as the power to grant bail under Section 439 CrPC is concerned, the court observed that this power is subject to the conditions laid down in Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which commences with a non-obstante clause.  Admittedly, the co-accused were arraigned based on confessional statement of the petitioner along with the confessional statement of co-accused, Balwant. Further, no recovery was effected from them. Therefore, the orders passed by the Court in co-accused's case will not advance petitioner's case.   Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the huge quantity of contraband recovered from the petitioner, stringent provision of Section 37 and presumption under Section 54 of the NDPS Act as well as the fact that the trial is progressing, the court did not deem it fit to grant regular bail to the petitioner.  Consequently, the court dismissed the instant petition. Case Title: Harjeet Lal @ Laddu Vs. State of Punjab

In an important direction, the Allahabad High Court recently instructed the Advocate General for the State of Uttar Pradesh to not accept any case diary unless a certificate is appended to the same by the Investigating Officer that complete original or true copy of the same is being produced.  The Bench of Justice Vivek Agarwal has further directed the Addl. Advocate General to communicate the copy of the order to all the Superintendents Of Police for its immediate compliance w.e.f. August 16, 2021.   The Court was hearing the plea of a constable accused under the POCSO Act wherein he claimed that he was at the place of his duty during the commission of the crime.  He relied upon the information received by him under the Right to Information Act, that he was on duty as traffic police personnel (during the relevant time of the incident) and that his duty timings were from 3:00 to 10:00 pm at Ghaziabad and he was dispatched for duty at 2:00 pm.  However, the advocate for the private respondent, on the other hand, argued that as per the probe of the Investigating Officer, the location of the mobile number carried by the accused was found close to the place of the incident.  However, when the Government Advocate was asked to supply a copy of the Purcha No. SCD-02 enclosed with the case diary (in which the presence of the accused near the place of the incident was claimed), it was submitted that the complete case diary had not been sent to the office of Advocate General.  In this backdrop, the Addl. Advocate General was requested by the Court to look into the matter and the Court directed thus:  "…the office of Advocate General shall not accept any case diary unless a certificate is appended by the Investigating Officer of the case that he is producing a complete original or true copy of the case diary containing pages from 1 to ....along with an Index of the documents which form part of the case diary, and in case it is found that incomplete case diary is accepted without the endorsement of the I.O. causing inconvenience to the court and wastage of precious time then the office of Advocate General may be held responsible and consequences may follow" Case title - Constable Ajeet Singh v.

The Jharkhand High Court recently held that Section 19(2) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 is akin to the provision under Section 96(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure which bars appeal from a decree passed with the consent of parties. It added that this bar operates with further expansion under Section 19(2), in as much as, no appeal shall also lie from "any order" passed by the Family Court with the consent of the parties. The matter was being heard by a Division Bench of Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Ratnaker Bhengra, which dismissed the first appeal as not maintainable. The first appeal was filed by the wife, aggrieved by the divorce decree awarded under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, on the ground that she was threatened to sign the said petition for a decree of dissolution of marriage by mutual consent.  As per the original suit, it was recorded that a petition for divorce by mutual consent was filed with the signature of both parties. Based on the petition, the Family Court Judge had recorded that to ensure free consent of both the parties, the statement of both the parties was recorded, and their signatures were put thereon. Advocate Rakhi Sharma, appearing for the respondent, objected to the maintainability of the First Appeal under Section 19(2) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, where an appeal from a decree or order passed by the Family Court with the consent of the parties is barred.  It referred to the case of Pushpa Devi Bhagat v. Rajendra Singh, where the Supreme Court, after referring to section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure and proviso to Order XXIII Rule 3 and Rule 3-A of the Code of Civil Procedure held that the only remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such consent decree is to approach the Court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it. Accordingly, the High Court observed, "...the provision under sub-section (2) to section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 is akin to the provision under sub-section(3) to section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, with further expansion of bar under sub-section (2) to section 19, inasmuch as, no appeal shall lie also from "any order" passed by the learned Family Court with the consent of the parties."

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that before resorting to provisions contained in Order V Rule 15 (Issuance of Summons) of the CPC, it has to be shown that the defendant is absent from his residence at the time when the service of the summons is sought to be effected and there is no likelihood of his being found at the residence within a reasonable time. A bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar observed,   "It has also to be shown that the defendant has no agent empowered to accept the service of the summons on his behalf. Only when the conducts above are fulfilled, O V, R15 can be taken recourse to".  The observations were made while hearing an appeal in terms of which the appellant had challenged an order passed by the Principal District Judge, Kathua, whereby his application under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure(CPC) for setting aside ex parte judgment and decree passed by the same court, had been dismissed.   The respondent herein had filed a petition for dissolution of marriage under section 13 of the Jammu and Kashmir Hindu Marriage Act before the trial court. After summons were issued to appellant, the same were stated to have been served upon her father. When the appellant did not appear before the court below on the date fixed, she was proceeded ex parte and an ex parte judgment and decree of divorce came to be passed under section 13(1)(ii)(v) of the Jammu and Kashmir Hindu Marriage Act in favour of the respondent.  Aggrieved of the same the appellant had filed an application under Order IX Rule 13 of the CPC seeking setting aside of ex parte judgment and decree and an another application under section 5 of the Limitation Act seeking condonation of delay was also filed by the appellant before the trial court on 13.10.2018, both of which came to be dismissed.  The appellant challenged the impugned order primarily on the ground that the service of the summons has not been effected upon her in terms of Order V Rule 15 of the CPC as the conditions contained therein have not been satisfied. Appellant submitted that the respondent knew that the appellant was not residing with her father but was residing at Lakhanpur and in spite of this he gave wrong address of the appellant in the divorce petition so as to obtain an ex parte decree against her.   Respondents contended that the appellant had the knowledge about the pendency of the petition and she had been duly served through her father but she did not choose to appear before the court.  After considering the rival contentions Justice Dhar observed Order IX Rule 13 CPC( Setting aside Ex-parte Decrees) that for a defendant to succeed in an application for setting aside ex parte decree, he has to satisfy the court that the summons was not duly served or that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was called on for hearing.  Pointing out to the fact that service of the summons upon the appellant has been effected by taking resort to provisions contained in Order V Rule 15 of the CPC, the bench explained that before resorting to provisions contained in Order V Rule 15 of the CPC, it has to be shown that the defendant is absent from his residence at the time when the service of the summons is sought to be effected and there is no likelihood of his being found at the residence within a reasonable time.  The bench after examining the record noted that summons were issued by the trial court to the appellant, at the address of her father’s house located at Ward No. 15, Patel Nagar, Kathua and the report of the Process Server revealed that the appellant was not present at the said address but her father conveyed to Process Server that she had gone out of station whereafter he received the summons by endorsing his signatures thereon.  Court further noted that on October 28, 2017 statement of the Process Server was recorded on oath by the learned trial court in which he confirmed the veracity of the reports on the two summons abd the trial court relying upon the report of the Process Server declared that the appellant had been served through her father and proceeded ex parte against her.  Noting that the trial court had made several attempts to serve summons upon the appellant, the court recorded that her father had accepted the summons informing the Process Server that he would convey the same to the appellant, without informing the Process Server that the appellant was not residing with him nor did he come in the witness box before the trial court to state so, was sufficient for the trial court to infer that the appellant resided with her father.  Commenting further on the subject the bench said that since the appellant had not also empowered any agent to accept service of summons on her behalf, the conditions mentioned in Order V Rule 15 of the CPC were satisfied in the instant case and accordingly, the trial court had rightly declared that the appellant has been duly served with the summons.  "Once she did not appear before the learned trial court, there was no option left before the trial court but to proceed ex parte against her and to pass ex parte judgment and decree on the basis of ex parte evidence led by the respondent herein", the court said.  Finding the appeal without merit, the bench dismissed the same.  Case Title: Dr Kiran Bala Vs Dr Ashwini Kumar Singh Jasrotia.  Coram: Justice Sanjay Dhar   
The Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi Government to ensure free food and medical treatment to HIV positive persons, who are below the poverty line and are unable to afford the same in the national capital. A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad also directed the Delhi government to ensure strict compliance of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention & Control) Act 2017 and the Rules made thereunder. The court passed the direction while disposing of a public interest litigation filed in 2011 by various individuals, who were suffering from HIV AIDS and multiple disabilities, for housing and other facilities for their well being, including hot cooked meals.  The PIL had also sought direction for expeditious decision by Centre on all required policies and schemes at national and state level for food security, permanent housing and shelter to all such patients.  The court took note of the response filed by the Delhi Government stating that National AIDS Control Programme is being implemented in the national capital since 1998 under the technical and financial support of National AIDS Control Organization.  A latest affidavit filed by the Delhi Government on December 19, 2022 also stated that various rehabilitative schemes and measures are being taken to provide aid and assistance to ameliorate the condition of patients who are HIV positive. The court noted that 120 beneficiaries are enrolled under “Travel concession scheme for PLHIVS/CLHIVs for People/Children infected with HIV attending the ART centres in Delhi for undertaking visits to the ART centres” scheme implemented by the Delhi Government and that 429 applications are presently under process. “A perusal of the above makes it abundantly evident that the GNCTD is ensuring strict compliance under the statutory provisions of the 2017 Act. Further, the GNCTD has taken all possible steps to ensure that affordable treatment is available to individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS, who do not possess the financial wherewithal to do so,” the court said.  Title: GIRISH & ORS v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS    
The Delhi High Court has disposed of a public interest litigation seeking recovery of damages from persons who allegedly indulged in destruction of public and private properties during the protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad observed that once Claim Commissioner has already been appointed to consider grant of compensation and that FIRs have already been registered by Delhi police, no further orders are required to be passed in the matter. In an affidavit filed in the plea, Delhi Police informed court that out of the total 541 FIRs registered against those who damaged public and private properties, only eight have been decided in courts and trial is pending in 51 percent of the cases. As reported earlier, the reply dated September 20, 2022 revealed that while trial is pending in 276 cases, investigation is yet to be completed in 213 cases. A total of 23 FIRs were registered in 2020 against those accused of damaging public properties including a temple, masjids, CCTV cameras, police booths and barricades. On the other hand, 518 FIRs were registered against the damage caused to private properties such as shops, houses and personal vehicles. The Delhi Police also informed court that Justice (retd.) Sunil Gaur has been appointed as the Claim Commissioner to investigate the damages and for awarding compensation relating to the riots. “In the considered opinion of this Court, once the Claim Commissioner has already been appointed and is dealing with the issue in question for grant of compensation and further considering that FIRs have been registered, no further orders are required to be passed in the present writ petition. Accordingly, the petition is disposed of, along with pending application(s), if any,” the court said. The court had issued notice in the PIL in March last year and sought responses from Ministry of Home Affairs, Delhi Government and Delhi Police. Filed by an advocate and a law student, the PIL claimed that they personally visited various places in the city and were shocked to see the damages caused to public properties during the riots and the resultant huge loss to the government exchequer. The PIL prayed that an independent machinery be set up to assess the damage caused and for recovery of the same from identified persons. Calling the contentions raised in the plea as false and baseless, the Delhi Police in the status report had said the police authorities acted promptly, vigilantly and effectively in a "professional manner" during the riots. Advocates Yudhvir Singh Chauhan, Shivangi Shokeen and Aditya Sharma appeared for the petitioners. 
Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with a petition against the order passed by the learned Additional Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Ferozepur via which petitioner's defense was struck off, held that the provisions of Order 8 Rule 1 of the CPC are directory in nature, however, the Courts must exercise their discretion to condone the delay in filing the written statement after exercising due circumspection and if it appears that the defendant has attempted to engage in dilatory tactics, the Courts should nip the same unhesitatingly.  The provisions of Order 8 Rule 1 of the CPC no doubt are directory in nature, however, at the same time the Courts must exercise their discretion to condone the delay, if any, in filing the written statement after exercising due circumspection and in case there appears to be an attempt on the part of the defendant to engage in dilatory tactics, the Courts should nip the same unhesitatingly.  The bench comprising Justice Manjari Nehru Kaul while allowing the petition, noted that the petitioners were granted four opportunities to file their written statement, however, they failed to do so.  Adverting to the case in hand, the petitioners were granted four opportunities to file their written statement, however, they failed to do so.  The court further added that if they are not granted one more opportunity, they would suffer irreparable loss which in turn would result in the miscarriage of justice.  Be that as it may, if the petitioners are not granted one more opportunity to file their written statement, they would suffer irreparable loss which in turn would result in the miscarriage of justice.  Therefore, for just and proper adjudication of the case, the Court granted one last effective opportunity to the petitioners to file their written statement in default of which, the case shall not be adjourned any further for filing of their written statement, and consequently their defense shall be deemed to be struck off.  Therefore, for just and proper adjudication of the case, this Court deems it appropriate to grant one last effective opportunity to the petitioners to file their written statement.

Sree Surya Developers and Promoters vs N. Sailesh Prasad  (SC) 143The Supreme Court has held that a separate suit challenging a consent decree is not maintainable.A party to a consent decree based on a compromise to challenge the compromise decree on the ground that the decree was not lawful i.e., it was void or voidable has to approach the same court, which recorded the compromise, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna observed.In this... The Supreme Court has held that a separate suit challenging a consent decree is not maintainable. A party to a consent decree based on a compromise to challenge the compromise decree on the ground that the decree was not lawful i.e., it was void or voidable has to approach the same court, which recorded the compromise, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna observed. In this case, the defendant to a suit filed an application under order VII Rule 11 CPC for rejection of the plaint on various grounds and mainly on the ground that the suit for setting aside the consent decree/Compromise Decree would be barred under Order XXIII Rule 3A of CPC. The Trial Court allowed the same and rejected the plaint on the ground that in view of Order XIII Rule 3A CPC, no independent suit would be maintainable against the Compromise Decree. Allowing the appeal filed by the plaintiff, the High court quashed and set aside the order passed by the Trial Court rejecting the plaint and remanded the matter to the Trial Court by observing that the effect of the provisions of Order XXXII Rules 1 to 7 CPC has not been considered by the Trial court, which would have a direct bearing on the validity of the Compromise Decree. The issue raised in appeal before the Supreme Court was whether the Trial Court rightly rejected the plaint in exercise of powers under Order VII Rule 11 CPC on the ground that an independent suit challenging the Compromise Decree would be barred in view of Order XXIII Rule 3A CPC is concerned, on plain reading of Order XXIII Rule 3A CPC? In this regard, the court noted the observations made in a recent judgment in R. Janakiammal Vs. S.K. Kumarasamy, (2021) 9 SCC 114 [LL 2021 SC 280]. The court said: "It is observed and held by this Court that Rule 3A of Order XXIII bars the suit to set aside the decree on the ground that the compromise on which decree was passed was not lawful. It is further observed and held that an agreement or compromise which is clearly void or voidable shall not be deemed to be lawful and the bar under Rule 3A shall be attracted if compromise on the basis of which the decree was passed was void or voidable. In this case, this Court had occasion to consider in detail Order XXIII Rule 3 as well as Rule 3A.  "That thereafter it is specifically observed and held that a party to a consent decree based on a compromise to challenge the compromise decree on the ground that the decree was not lawful i.e., it was void or voidable has to approach the same court, which recorded the compromise and a separate suit challenging the consent decree has been held to be not maintainable" Thus, the court concluded that the Trial Court was absolutely justified in rejecting the plaint on the ground that the suit for the reliefs sought challenging the Compromise Decree would not be maintainable. Yet another contention raised by the plaintiff was that in suit the plaintiff has not specifically prayed for setting aside the Compromise Decree and what is prayed is to declare that the Compromise Decree is not binding on him and that for the other reliefs sought, the suit would not be barred and still the suit would be maintainable. To reject this contention, the bench noted that, in this case, the reliefs of declaration of title, recovery of possession, cancellation of revocation of Gift Deed, declaration for DGPA and Deed of Assignment-cum-DGPA have been sought in the plaint. The said reliefs can be granted only if the Compromise Decree  is set aside.  As held by this Court in a catena of decisions right from 1977 that a mere clever drafting would not permit the plaintiff to make the suit maintainable which otherwise would not be maintainable and/or barred by law. It has been consistently held by this Court that if clever drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a cause of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so that bogus litigation will end at the earlier stage......Therefore, by asking such multiple reliefs, the plaintiff by clever drafting wants to get his suit maintainable, which otherwise would not be maintainable questioning the Compromise Decree. All the aforesaid reliefs were subject matter of earlier suits and thereafter also subject matter of O.S. No.1750 of 2015 in which the Compromise Decree has been passed. Allowing the appeal, the court also added that the High Court has erred in setting aside the said order by entering into the merits of the validity of the Compromise Decree on the ground that the same was hit by Order XXXII Rule 7 CPC. "What was required to be considered by the High Court was whether the independent suit questioning the Compromise Decree would be maintainable or not. The aforesaid crucial aspect has not been dealt with by the High Court at all and High Court has gone into the validity of the Compromise Decree in view of Order XXXII Rule 7 CPC. At the stage of deciding the application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, the only thing which was required to be considered by the High Court was whether the suit would be maintainable or not and that the suit challenging the Compromise Decree would be maintainable or not in view of Order XXIII Rule 3A CPC and at this stage, the High Court / Court was not required to consider on merits the validity of the Compromise Decree.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that merely because the detaining Authority among other grounds has also observed that the activities of the detenu pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of the people would not render the impugned order of detention under Section 3 of the PIT-NDPS Act illegal.  Section 3 of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 empowers the government to detain a person to prevent him from engaging in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The petitioner-detenu in this case had challenged an order passed by the Divisional Commissioner, Jammu, whereby the petitioner had been taken into preventive custody in terms of Section 3 on the ground that the activities of the petitioner pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of the people. It was argued that such a ground is alien to requirements of Section 3 of the PIT-NDPS Act. Dismissing his petition, Justice Sanjay Dhar observed,  "Merely, because the Detaining Authority has also observed that the activities of the petitioner pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of the people would not render the impugned order of detention illegal when it is clearly discernible from the contents of the impugned order of detention that the Detaining Authority has after recording subjective satisfaction that the petitioner is indulging in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that it is necessary to prevent him from doing so, passed impugned order of detention it cannot be said that the ground is alien to the provisions contained in Section 3 of the PIT NDPS Act"  The respondents contested the plea by submitting that the petitioner is a habitual drug peddler and smuggler who is indulging in illicit traffic of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Respondents further contended that the detenu poses a serious threat to the lives of young generation as well as to the economy of the Union Territory and has been found involved in numerous offences and various FIRs have been registered against the petitioner in District Jammu.  After considering the rival contentions on the matter, Justice Dhar observed that Section 3 of the PITNDPS Act is amply clear that an order of preventive detention under section 3 of the PITNDPS Act can be passed on the ground of preventing a person from engaging in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  While perusing the contents of the detention order the bench noted that the impugned order of detention shows that the Detaining Authority has observed that the petitioner is engaged in repeated cases of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of the people.  "It is clear that the Detaining Authority has spelt out in the order of detention that activities of the petitioner pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of the people as he is engaged in repeated illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and with a view to prevent him from doing so, the order of detention has been passed", the court said.  Answering the contention as to whether only two incidents of such nature were sufficient for the Detaining Authority to initiate proceedings for preventive detention is concerned, the court observed,  "Even one incident may be sufficient to satisfy the Detaining Authority. It all depends upon the nature of the incident".  The court observed that the Detaining Authority was fully satisfied that there was apprehension that the petitioner would indulge in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, in case he was allowed to remain free. The sufficiency of the material or the degree of probative criteria for satisfaction for the detention is the domain of the Detaining Authority and this Court cannot sit in appeal or exercise its powers of judicial review in this regard, it underscored.  The court accordingly could not find any ground to interfere with the impugned order of detention and hence dismissed the petition.  Case Title: Tajinder Singh alias Happy Vs UT of J&K & Ors.

In a recent order, the Gujarat High Court has held that the benefits of reinstatement would be a 'normal course' that ought to follow once there is a violative of Section 25(F) under the Industrial Disputes Act.

In a recent order, the Gujarat High Court has held that the benefits of reinstatement would be a 'normal course' that ought to follow once there is a violative of Section 25(F) under the Industrial Disputes Act.  Keeping in view this principle, the High Court reinstated, without backwages, the Petitioner who working as a 'sweeper' under the State for 6 years. The Labour Court's award only granting lumpsum compensation to the tune of Rs. 54,000 as was modified to that extent. Justice Biren Vaishnav stated: "Having therefore found that the Labour Court having positively held that there was violation of Sec.25(F) of the Act, for no fault of the petitioner, the Labour Court proceedings having been prolonged at the instance of the respondents, the petitioner could not have been then deprived of the benefits of reinstatement which is a normal course that ought to have been followed once violation of Sec.25(F) is otherwise proved."  The observation comes in a petition challenging Labour Court's award granting lump-sum compensation and seeking reinstatement with full backwages and consequential benefits.  The Petitioner-workman had been removed from service on account of outsourcing policy from May 2006 onwards. Initially, the Labour Court had granted reinstatement with 25% backwages but the same was set aside vide a fresh order in a Miscellaneous Application wherein compensation came to be granted.  The Petitioner primarily averred that she had worked for 240 days in each year of service continuously and further, the Respondents had failed to adduce any evidence which would establish that the termination was not bad in law. The AGP contrasted this with the argument that the Petitioner was a part-time worker.  The Labour Court had taken note of Director, Fisheries Terminal Department vs. Bhikubhai Meghajibhai Chavda to conclude that the petitioner was in continuous service of 240 days as defined in Section 25(B) of the Act and therefore, there was violation of provisions of Sec. 25(F) of the Act. However, the Labour Court had also cited Hari Nandan Prasad & anr vs. Employer I/R to Management of Food Corporation of India & Anr to opine that reinstatement could not be granted due to a lapse of 12 years since termination.  The High Court was of the view that the Labour Court "materially erred" in not granting the benefit of reinstatement on the ground of period of 12 years having gone by since adjudication. It observed that violation of Section 25(F) in the present case was 'writ large' and the proceedings were prolonged solely at the instance of the respondents.  Thus, the Respondents were directed to pass the reinstatement order within 3 months.  Case No.: C/SCA/1793/2019  Case Title: SAVITABEN MANGALBHAI HARIJAN v/s SUPERINTENDENT

The Allahabad High Court has observed that the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961 Act does not contain any such stipulation regarding the time difference between the first and second child for the grant of maternity benefits. A With this, the Court granted relief to an Inter College lecturer whose application for maternity leave had been rejected by placing reliance on Rule 153(1) of the Financial Handbook by contending that the same contains a restriction that the second maternity leave cannot be granted where there is a difference of less than two years between the end of the first maternity leave and grant of second maternity leave. The case in brief Essentially, her maternity leave application had been rejected on the ground that she had previously availed maternity leave which ended on May 18, 2018, which was a period less than 2 years, and hence, she was not entitled to the maternity leave as per Rule 153(1) of the Financial Handbook. Before the Court, she argued that she had applied for maternity leave for a period of 174 days from November 26, 2017, to May 18, 2018, which was duly sanctioned and the petitioner gave birth to a baby boy on January 29, 2018, but unfortunately, the newborn child passed away due to cardiorespiratory just a day after his birth.  The petitioner again conceived for the second time and applied for maternity leave for a period of 24 weeks from November 18, 2018 to May 16, 2019, which had been rejected by means of the impugned order. It was argued by her counsel that Rule 153(1) of the Financial Handbook runs contrary to the mandatory provisions of the 1961 Act, which doesn't stipulate any mandatory lapse of time between the first and second child so as to become eligible for the grant of maternity benefit. In view of this, considering the provisions of Section 27 of the 1961 Act, the Counsel contended, that Rule 153(1) of the Financial Handbook Vol. II to IX would have to be read down and it is the provisions of the 1961 Act that would prevail. On the other hand, the Counsel for the state argued that the impugned order is in conformity with the provisions of Rule 153(1) of the Financial Handbook Volume II to IV where a restriction has been placed for grant of maternity benefits prior to 2 years having lapsed from the date of expiry of the last maternity leave granted under the Rule. Court's observations  At the outset, the bench of Justice Alok Mathur observed that a perusal of the provisions of the 1961 Act indicate that a woman would be entitled to give notice in writing for grant of maternity benefit, and on receipt of the notice, the employer shall permit such a woman to absent herself from the establishment during the period for which she receives the maternity benefit.  "The 1961 Act does not contain any such stipulation of the time difference between the grant of maternity benefit for the first and second child as stipulated in Rule 153 (1) of the Financial Handbook," the Court observed as it stressed that the 1961 Act does not contain any such stipulation. Accordingly, the Court held that the respondents patently erred in placing reliance on Rule 153(1) of the Financial Handbook in rejecting the application of the petitioner for grant of maternity leave. "The Maternity Benefit Act 1961 has been enacted by the Parliament on a subject which finds mention in entry 24 of list III, and it was totally within its competence to make such an enactment. Even if the state legislature were to make such a law, overriding the provisions contained in the Maternity Benefit Act then the said act would be reserved for accent of the President and would be enforceable only after obtaining such an accent as provided in article 254(2) of the Constitution of India," the Court remarked. Consequently, the Court held that once the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 has been adopted by the State of U.P. then the said Act of 1961 would apply with full force irrespective of the provisions contained in the Financial Handbook which is merely an executive instruction and would, in any case, be subsidiary to the legislation made by the Parliament. "The provision of Financial Handbook are preConstitutional executive instructions and would be subsidiary to the Act of Parliament and in case of any inconsistency, the statutoy enactment framed by the Parliament would prevail and hence the provisions of Maternity Benefits Act, 1961 would prevail over the provisions of Financial Handbook and, therefore, provision of Rule 153 (1) of the Financial Handbook Volume I to IV are read down with regard to admissibility of leave to a woman with regard to second pregnancy which would be governed by Maternity Benefits Act, 1961 and not Rule 153 (1) of the Financila Handbook Volume II to IV," the Court held as it the writ petition is allowed and the respondents were directed to grant maternity benefit to the petitioner in terms of the Maternity Benefit Act 1961. Case title - Satakshi Mishra v. State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Secondary Edu. Dept. Lucknow And 4 Others [WRIT - A No. - 5114 of 2022]    
The Himachal Pradesh High Court on Thursday ordered defreezing of the account of an accused observing that Section 102 CrPC (Power of police officer to seize certain property) empowers the Police Officer to seize certain property on existence of a condition that the said property should have been alleged or suspected to have been stolen or which may be found under circumstances which create suspicion of commission of any offence. The observations were made by Justice Vivek Singh Thakur while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had approached the Court against the dismissal of her application by the Magistrate, for release/de-freezing her Saving Bank Accounts in State Bank of India.  The Petitioner had approached the trial Court under Section 457 CrPC for release/de-freezing of account numbers of the petitioner but the said application was dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that investigation was pending.  While examining the record the bench noted that the respondent-Investigating Agency has completed the investigation and as per conclusion of investigation, no offence was found to be committed by the petitioner and, therefore, cancellation report was prepared and submitted to Law Officer for vetting and verification.  The bench further noted that the said cancellation report was returned by the Law Officer with certain comments and as per Investigating Agency steps for removing objections raised by the Law Officer are in progress and investigation is yet to be completed.  In its bid to answer the moot question as to whether the account of the petitioner could continued to be kept under freeze or otherwise the bench observed that Section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the Police Officer to seize certain property on existence of certain condition which is pre-requisite, empowering the Police Officer to seize such property. He can seize any property, but the said property should have been the property which may be alleged or suspected to have been stolen or which may be found under circumstances which create suspicion of commission of any offence, it underscored.  Deliberating further on the matter the bench observed that the commission of any offence or levelling allegations of commission of offence is not sufficient to freeze the accounts of a person except as permissible under law and that too when such pendency of investigation extends for an infinite period, particularly when the property is neither a suspected stolen property nor there is any nexus between the property, i.e. Bank accounts and the commission of alleged offence by the accused. In the aforesaid circumstances the Court found that neither ingredients of Section 102 CrPC are existing to empower the Police Officer to seize the bank accounts of the petitioner nor any nexus or link has been pointed out, much less established, by the Investigating Agency between the offence allegedly, as per complainant, committed by the petitioner and operation of bank accounts concerned.  Accordingly the bench found the petitioner entitled for de-freezing of her accounts mentioned and to operate them in accordance with law subject to furnishing personal bond for an amount lying deposited in the bank accounts at the time of freezing of these bank accounts by giving undertaking therein to produce the said amount in the Court or anywhere else, wherever directed by the Court during trial or on conclusion of trial.

Expressing concern over the manner in which a visiting parent is often treated by the parent who is in custody of the child, the Madras High Court recently observed that every child has a right and need for an unthreatened and loving relationship with both the parents.  The court was deciding upon an application filed by a father with respect to right to visit his child who was living with the mother. He had contended that though he had visitation right on every alternate days between 6pm and 8pm, the mother was now planning to take the child to Delhi and settle there. The mother appeared and submitted that she had no such intention and in turn requested a modification to the earlier order to the effect that the father be given visitation rights on Friday and Saturday at the residence of the mother.  The court allowed the same and in the process went on to discuss in detail about the instances of ill-treatment and non-cooperation by one spouse towards the other who visits to see his/her child. The court opined that it is the children who are the ultimate sufferers undergoing emotional pain and mental trauma silently at the time of separation.   Justice Krishnan Ramasamy remarked as under:  Every child has a right to access both parents and get the love and affection of both parents. Whatever be the differences between the spouses, the child cannot be denied company of the other spouse.   The court also observed that some spouses after developing animosity towards the other spouse, used to engage in ill treating the visiting spouse. This in turn leads to quarrelling in front of the child who often gets disturbed. These feelings of vulnerability and insecurity can shape a child's personality and can even last a lifetime. The court equated such instances of parental alienation to child abuse and held that it had severe ill effects on the child like self hatred, lack of trust, depression etc.   A Parent who would teach a child to hate or fear the other parent represents a grave and persistent danger to the mental and emotional health of that child. Alienated children are no less damaged than other child victims of extreme conflict, however abusive that relationship may be. the court opined.   Thus, it was the duty of both the parents to behave friendly before their child so that the child feels secured and enjoys the moments in the company of both parents which develops positive feelings in him.   The court directed that even though the spouses may not consider each other as husband and wife due to personal indifference, they could still treat the visiting parent as an "Athithi" (Guest) and show kindness and empathy towards the guest who is none other than the parent of the child and respect him/her in front of the child.   The spouse shall treat other spouse, though not as wife/husband due personal indifferences, but atleast treat him/her as a guest by paying more attention than wife/husband since in our customs and practice, a guest is treated as "Athidi Devo Bhava (Guest is God)" and show kindness and empathy towards the guest who is none other than the parent of the child and respect him/her in front of the child.  Thus, the court directed the Respondent wife to not cause any inconvenience to the father when he was visiting the child and instead show hospitality by providing snacks and dinner, etc., to him and have the same along with her child which shall create a happy atmosphere for the child.

The Delhi High Court has observed that the interrogatories cannot be used by the plaintiff in a suit for substituting its burden of proving things by adducing relevant evidence, adding that its objective is to narrow the controversy and facilitate framing of issues regarding the disputed facts. Justice Neena Bansal Krishna further added that Order 11 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is for expediting trial of the suit, thereby saving judicial time and costs of litigation.  "The interrogatories must be used liberally by the parties. One of the great object of the interrogatories when properly administered is to save evidence i.e., to diminish the burden of proof which was otherwise on the plaintiff. The object is not merely to discover the facts but also to save the expense of proving a part on the case," the court said.  Order XI Rule 1 of the Code states that the plaintiff or defendant in a suit may, by leave of the Court, deliver interrogatories in writing for examination of opposite parties or any of the parties.  The provision also states that no party shall deliver more than one set of interrogatories to the same party without an order for the same.  The Court observed that interrogatories are not limited to giving plaintiff the knowledge of something which is not already known, but includes getting admission of anything which he has to prove on any issue raised between him and the defendant.  "Order 11 gives a party a right to interrogate with a view to obtain an admission from his opponent of everything which is material and relevant to the issue raised in the pleadings," the court added.  The court was dealing with an application filed under Order XI Rules 1 and 5 read with Section 151 of the Code by Micromax Media Private Limited seeking directions to make Hewlett Packard India Sales Private Limited officials to answer the interrogatories in the suit. The application stated that the defendants in their Written Statement-cum-Counter Claim had admitted the entitlement of the plaintiff company to the MVC rebates and bonus for the period between December 2008 till June 2009. Hewlett however allegedly set off and raised a counter-claim of Rs. 5,69,00,000 against Micromax claiming that it had received excess payments from November 2007 to April 2009 which was discovered during the audit. No document was placed by the defendant company on the basis of which it was claiming excess payment, the court was told. The counsel appearing for the defendant company sought dismissal of the application by taking a preliminary objection that the company had nowhere admitted to the entitlements to the alleged MVC rebates.  It was also argued that the interrogatories sought to be administered to the defendants were nothing but a fishing expedition tantamounting to embarking on a roving enquiry. Dismissing the application filed by Micromax, the Court noted that while the plaintiff company had explained in detail its claim and entitlement, the defendants in their Written Statement not only denied the said rebates but also filed a Counter-Claim.  "…. it is evident that there was multiple-tier process for enquiring into the MVC rebates due to plaintiff, which according to the plaintiff had been stringently followed and there are no excess payment made. It is for the plaintiff to prove its case in regard to its entitlements and the interrogatories sought by the plaintiff do not meet the criteria of interrogatories and cannot be permitted," the court said.  The court also observed that the documents sought from the defendants, relating to their Counter-Claim, did not shorten the controversy or narrow the scope of evidence that the plaintiff would have to necessarily prove in support of its claim.

The Court opined that conditions of that nature defeat the very purpose of grant of such loans.The Kerala High Court on Tuesday reiterated that the CIBIL scores of co-borrowers do not play a role in deciding applications for education loans since the eligibility conditions for sanctioning such priority sector loans should have a nexus with the object sought to be achieved by these loans.  Justice N. Nagaresh also observed that imposing such conditions would defeat the very purpose of granting such loans, thereby discouraging banks from doing so.  "The Banks including the nationalised Banks are within their competence to sanction student/education loans dehors any special Scheme framed by the Government or RBI. But, when the Banks disburse loans as priority sector loans, the eligibility criteria fixed for sanction of such loans should necessarily have a nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The Nationalised Banks and Scheduled Banks will not be justified in framing conditions for sanctioning of such priority sector loans so as to defeat the very purpose of grant of such loans." The petitioners had moved the Court aggrieved by the denial of education loans by the 2nd respondent-Manager of State Bank of India citing that their co-applicants (parents) did not have the requisite CIBIL scores. Advocates Manoj Ramaswamy, Jolima George, Jisha Sasi, C.B. Sabeela, Aparna G and Chinnu Rose Mary Thomas appeared for the petitioners and argued that the Reserve Bank of India had affirmed that an education loan is a futuristic loan aimed to provide financial support from the banking system to deserving/meritorious students for pursuing higher education in India and abroad. They argued that the rejection of their loan applications goes against the RBI mandate.  Further, reliance was placed on Pranav S.R. v. The Branch Manager, SBI & Anr to contend that unsatisfactory credit scores of the parents of the applicants cannot be a ground to reject an educational loan application since the repayment capacity of the applicant after his education should be the deciding factor. Therefore, it was submitted that the respondents were compelled to sanction and disburse the educational loan applied for by the petitioners.  Advocates Jawahar Jose, Cissy Mathews and Edwin Joseph appearing for the respondents vehemently opposed the petition. The Bank submitted that the SBI educational loan policy was that the loan would be sanctioned jointly in the name of the student and their parents/guardians and therefore, the parent/guardian would be a co-borrower in the loan. The Bank has to ensure that the co-borrower has the necessary credit discipline and has the prerogative to depend upon the Credit Information Report, it was submitted. The respondent stated that an RBI Circular issued in 2014 requires that banks/financial institutions include in their credit appraisal process/loan policies, suitable provisions for obtaining Credit Information Reports from one or more of the Credit Information Companies so that the credit decisions are based on information available in the system. The educational loans are classified as retail loans as per another RBI Circular issued in 2007, contended the respondents. Consequently, in SBI's Master Circular dated 20.03.2021, it was provided that Borrower/Co-borrower/Guarantor should not have any adverse credit history. However, the Court opined that the 2007 and 2014 RBI Circulars do not apply to the facts of these petitions and agreed with the dictum laid down in Pranav S.R (supra). It was held that the educational loans provided by the Banks in India under Vidya Lakshmi Scheme stand on a different footing from the circulars relied on by the respondents.  "India is one of the youngest nations in the world with more than 54% of the total population below 25 years of age. Yet, less than 5% of potential workforce in India gets formal skill training to be employable and stay employable. With a view to enable poor and middle class students to pursue higher education of their choice without any constraint of funds, a Scheme was provided by the Government of India to ensure that no student misses out on higher education for lack of funds." The Court also noted that in the exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21 and 35A r/w Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, the RBI in public interest issued Reserve Bank of India (Priority Sector LendingTargets and Classification) Directions, 2020. Attention was called to Direction 4 contained therein which categorises Education as a priority sector.  Further, Direction 11 stated that loans to individuals for educational purposes, including vocational courses, not exceeding ₹20 lakhs will be considered eligible for priority sector classification. Therefore, the petitions were allowed and the respondents were directed to reconsider the petitioners' loan applications disregarding the low Credit Score of the co-borrowers, and sanction and disburse eligible loan amount, if the petitioners are otherwise eligible, within one month. Case Title: Kiran David v. Assistant General Manager  
The Supreme Court has held that where there are more consumers than one having similar grievance, it is not necessary that they must file consumer complaint in representative capacity under Section 35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019. Instead, these few consumers can join together and file a joint complaint."There is nothing in the Consumer Protection Act 2019 to prohibit these... The Supreme Court has held that where there are more consumers than one having similar grievance, it is not necessary that they must file consumer complaint in representative capacity under Section 35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019.  Instead, these few consumers can join together and file a joint complaint. "There is nothing in the Consumer Protection Act 2019 to prohibit these few consumers from joining together and filing a joint complaint", the Court observed. The Court contrasted a "joint complaint" from a complaint filed under "representative capacity". "A careful reading of the above provisions would show that there is no scope for the contention that wherever there are more consumers than one, they must only take recourse to Order I Rule 8 CPC, even if the complaint is not on behalf of or for the benefit of, all the consumers interested in the matter. There may be cases where only "a few consumers" and not "numerous consumers" have the same interest. There is nothing in the Act to prohibit these few consumers from joining together and filing a joint complaint. A joint complaint stands in contrast to a complaint filed in a representative capacity. For attracting the provisions of Section 35(1)(c), the complaint filed by one or more consumers should be on behalf of or for the benefit of numerous consumers having the same interest. It does not mean that where there are only very few consumers having the same interest, they cannot even join together and file a single complaint, but should take recourse only to independent and separate complaints." The Court also observed that the though Section 2(5)(i) of the Act- which defines "complainant"-  uses the word "a consumer", it has to be understood as including plural consumers. "Under Section 13(2) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa in all Central Acts and Regulations, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. We cannot read anything repugnant in the subject or context of Section 2(5) or 35(1)(c) or 38(11) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 to hold that the word in the singular, namely, "consumer" will not include the plural", the Court observed.  The Court gave the following illustration to explain the point : "We may take for example a case where a residential apartment is purchased by the husband and wife jointly or by a parent and child jointly. If they have a grievance against the builder, both of them are entitled to file a complaint jointly. Such a complaint will not fall under Section 35(1)(c) but fall under Section 35(1)(a). Persons filing such a complaint cannot be excluded from Section 2(5)(i) on the ground that it is not by a single consumer. It cannot also be treated as one by persons falling under Section 2(5)(v) attracting the application of Order I Rule 8 CPC read with Section 38(11)". When can a consumer complaint in representative capacity can be filed The court observed that to file a consumer complaint in representative capacity under Section 35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the complaint filed by one or more consumers should be on behalf of or for the benefit of numerous consumers having the same interest.  The bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian was considering a civil appeal challenging an order ("impugned judgement") of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission passed under Section 35(1)(c) of the Act.  In the impugned judgement NCDRC had allowed 91 purchasers of 51 apartments in the residential complex developed by them, to file a consumer complaint in a representative capacity, on behalf of and for the benefit of more than about 1000 purchasers, the builder has come up with the above appeal. While allowing the appeal, the bench in Brigade Enterprises Limited V. Anil Kumar Virmani & Ors said that since "sameness of interest" was the pre­requisite for an application under Order I Rule 8, CPC read with Section 35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, it was necessary for the respondents to include in the consumer complaint, sufficient averments that would show sameness of interest.  "The delay in handing over possession of the residential apartments might have given rise to a cause of action for the individual purchasers of flats to sue the builder. But sameness of the cause of action is not equal to sameness of interest," the bench further observed. Factual Background About 91 persons who purchased 51 residential apartments, in a residential complex comprising about 1134 apartments, promoted by the appellant (Brigade Enterprises Limited)joined together and filed a consumer complaint on the file of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi.  The Consumer complaint was accompanied by an application u/s 35(1)(c), seeking the permission of the National Commission to prosecute the matter jointly, for the benefit of and on behalf of, not only of the 91 applicants, but of numerous other consumers who have purchased apartments in the same complex.  Though the builder objected to the application u/s 35(1)(c) but the National Commission by relying on the Top Court's decision in Chairman, Tamil Nadu Housing Board, Madras vs. T.N. Ganapathy (1990) 1 SCC 608 and National Commission's decision in Ambrish Kumar Shukla vs. Ferrous Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Aggrieved, the builder approached the Top Court. Submission of Counsels Senior Advocate Jayant Bhushan appearing for the builder contended that out of total 1134 apartments constructed and sold by them since the owners of merely 51 apartments have joined together and such a miniscule percentage of consumers could not file a complaint in a representative capacity. It was also his contention that there was no commonality of interest or grievance, as some individual apartment owners had also invoked the jurisdiction of the Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, seeking redressal of their separate and distinct grievances. Senior Advocate Ajit Kumar Sinha appearing for the respondents contended that the issue was no longer res integra in view of the decisions of this Court in Chairman, Tamil Nadu Housing Board, Madras vs. T.N. Ganapathy and Vikrant Singh Malik & Ors. vs. Supertech Limited & Ors. (2020) 9 SCC 145. He further contended that the respondents had the sameness of interest with the buyers of all the 1134 apartments, which was a sine qua non for maintaining an application under Section 35(1)(c) and that, therefore, the National Commission was right in allowing the application. Advocate Omanakuttan KK appeared for the intervenors. Supreme Court's Analysis  The judgement authored by Justice V Ramasubramanian, while referring to Section 35(1)(c) of the Act, observed that it enables one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same interest, with the permission of the District Commission, to file a complaint, on behalf of or for the benefit of all consumers so interested. It was further observed that the sine qua non for invoking Section 35(1)(c) was that all consumers on whose behalf or for whose benefit the provision was invoked, should have the same interest. Relying on Section 38(11) of the Act which makes the provisions of Order I Rule 8 of the First Schedule to CPC, 1908 applicable to cases where the complainant is a consumer, the bench said,  "Order I Rule 8, CPC, unlike Section 35(1)(c) operates both ways and contains provisions for a two­ way traffic. It not only permits plaintiffs to sue in a representative capacity but also permits people to be sued and to be defended in an action, in a representative capacity." Emphasising on the explanation under Order I Rule 8, the bench said that the same distinguished persons having the same interest in one suit from persons having the same cause of action. In this regard it further noted that to establish sameness of interest, it was not necessary to establish sameness of the cause of action. Referring to the definition of complainant u/s 2(5), the bench said, "The proper way of interpreting Section 35(1) read with section 2(5), would be to say that a complaint may be filed: (i) by a single consumer; (ii) by a recognised consumer Association; (iii) by one or more consumers jointly, seeking the redressal of their own grievances without representing other consumers who may or may not have the same interest; (iv) by one or more consumers on behalf of or for the benefit of numerous consumers; and (v) the Central Government, Central Authority or State Authority. While allowing the appeal, the bench modified NCDRC's order to the effect that the complaint filed by the respondents could be treated as a joint complaint filed on the behalf of only the respondents and not as one filed in a representative capacity on behalf of or for the benefit of all the owners of all the 1134 flats.

The Bombay High Court recently directed the Commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to take a final decision regarding grant of permission for construction of a Floating Hotel (Floatel) anchoring off the Raj Bhavan. “We further direct that the Commissioner of Municipal Corporation shall take his final decision in the matter in accordance with law within a period of four weeks from the date of his decision having exclusive jurisdiction or receipt of recommendations from the Three Member Committee, as the case may be”, the court said.  The court directed the Commissioner to first decide whether he has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the matter or whether recommendations from the three-member committee formed by the High Court are required.  The Commissioner has to decide the NOC application within four weeks from the date of his decision regarding jurisdiction and within eight weeks from the date of submission of all relevant papers and representation by the petitioner company.  The division bench of Justice Sunil B. Shukre and Justice M. W. Chandwani also set aside the three-member committee’s 2017 order denying permission to construct the floating hotel and related infrastructure. The three-member committee was constituted via the High Court’s order on August 6, 2015, in a PIL Vinay Mulchand Yadav v. State of Maharashtra. The MCGM has to permit, prohibit or regulate any activity at Marine Drive depending upon the committee’s recommendation.  The petitioner sought permission to construct a Floating Hotel two nautical miles into the sea. Permission was also sought for construction of a waiting area and floating jetty near the National Centre for Performing Arts. The petitioner said that it will implement the project on the basis of an MoU with MTDC. The committee consisting of the Chairman of the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee, the Police Commissioner, Mumbai and the MCGM Commissioner denied the permission. Bombay HC in 2018 upheld this decision observing that the infrastructure would be an extension of the Marine Drive Promenade. However, last year, the Apex Court set aside the HC’s decision and sent the matter back for fresh consideration.  In the second round, the court agreed with the petitioner’s contention that none of the proposed structures form part of the Marine Drive Promenade. The court noted that the starting point of the floating jetty does not form part of the promenade and the proposed waiting area is on a piece of land not on the Promenade. Further, the parking area has been allotted by the MMRDA and is not part of the Promenade. Thus, the court stated that the MCGM Commissioner has to first decide whether he has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the petitioner’s NOC application. “…if he decides that he has such jurisdiction in the matter, he would have to go ahead to consider the application of the petitioner on its own merits, without being influenced by the order passed by this Court and also order passed by the Three Member Committee on 24th May 2017”, the court added.  However, if the Commissioner concludes that he has no exclusive rejection then he would have to refer the matter to the three-member committee and act on its recommendation, the court said. The recording of finding on jurisdiction is important as it does to the root of the dispute in the case, the court held. The court also set aside the order of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone-1, rejecting the NOC application. That order was based on the objection by the Senior Police Inspector, Marine Drive Police Station and the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Colaba division. The court said that neither of these authorities have any jurisdiction in the matter and the police authorities having jurisdiction have already given the green signal.  “The authority which is having jurisdiction in the matter, i.e. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mumbai had already granted permission for the subject project vide its communication dated 13th April 2011. There is another communication dated 9th June 2016 of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Head Office-1, MCGM granting permission for implementing the Floatel project and carrying out incidental activities. This permission, granted on 9th June 2016, would in particular, nullify the subsequent objection taken by the subordinate officer of the Commissioner of Mumbai Police”, the court held.

The Tripura High Court recently observed that a person engaged in contractual service cannot be said to have a "legitimate expectation" regarding extension of services beyond the contractual tenure or to continue in service despite expiry of contract period.The observation came from Justice T.

The Tripura High Court recently observed that a person engaged in contractual service cannot be said to have a "legitimate expectation" regarding extension of services beyond the contractual tenure or to continue in service despite expiry of contract period.The observation came from  Justice T. Amarnath Goud:   "In so far as the continuity of service beyond 30.06.2020 is concern, it is not legitimate expectation or the promise made by the respondents (employer) for continuing his service beyond 30.06.2020. In so far as the violation of principle of audi alteram is concern, the question of issuing any notice before putting an end to the tenure of petitioner's service is not indicated in the service condition in the year 2002 when the petitioner got into service to the said post for the first time."  The petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India whereby the petitioner had urged to quash and cancel the memorandum dated 30.06.2020 passed by the District Disability Rehabilitation Officer, District Disability Rehabilitation Centre (West) informing the petitioner not to attend his services any further.  Petitioner submitted before the court that the observation made by the respondents stating that the service of the petitioner was not satisfactory is adverse remark which creates a stigma. Moreover, counsel for the petitioner submitted that before making such decision, an opportunity ought to have been given by the respondents by following principle of natural justice.  The counsel appearing for the respondents submitted before the court that since it is contractual obligation, the petitioner has no right to continue beyond the period beyond which he has been employed.  Court noted that in so far as the violation of principle of audi alteram is concern, the question of issuing any notice before putting an end to the tenure of petitioner's service is not indicated in the service condition in the year 2002 when the petitioner got into service to the said post for the first time.  "The present memorandum does not speak of termination of the petitioner but only discontinuing the petitioner from service since the contractual obligation came to an end. This court, at this juncture, cannot give any direction to the respondents to enforce the contract to the petitioner despite his tenure is complete."  With regard to reliance placed by the petitioner on Ditul Debbarma vs State of Tripura & Ors., the court held that the facts of the judgment and the facts of the present case are distinct and the precdent cannot be applied herein.  In view of the above, the court found that the petition is devoid of merit and liable to be dismissed.   Case Title : Nandan Datta v State of Tripura and ors

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that Police is not supposed to act as a super boss of the public administration system.  A bench of Justice Rahul Bharti observed,  "In case any public servant is to be subjected to a surveillance mode by a rank holder police official on the pretext of a complaint received without first entertaining the said complaint into a formal process, then surely the very confidence of the public servant in acting and doing his duty will be subjected to a paralysis".  The Court was hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner, employed as a Junior Engineer in PHE Department, had called in question a course of action in which the Superintendent of Police Doda had entertained an anonymous complaint addressed against him and the action of SHO, addressing the impugned letter to the Petitioner's Head of Department asking for the information concerning the petitioner who is working under him.  The petitioner in his plea sought to attribute the filing of this anonymous complaint against him to vested interests operating against him who are having political score to settle with his father-in-law.  The petitioners further contended that all this stated aspect of the case had no bearing in the context of the legal aspect, which is the competence of the respondent SSP Doda & SHO P/S Doda to seize the said anonymous complaint and use it at their own level without even registering it as an FIR.   Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Bharti frowned over the manner police has acted in the matter and observed that the perusal of the objections filed on behalf of respondents would show that it is no where disclosed as to how respondent no. 2 i.e. the Superintendent of Police Doda entertained the said complaint instead of referring it to the petitioner's Head of the Department that being the Chief Engineer.   The bench questioned the action of the respondents by recording that it is not even forthcoming as to how come the respondent Station House Officer, Police Station Doda came to have the said anonymous complaint to his end for the purposes of immediately acting upon it by addressing a letter to the respondent Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda thereby asking for information about the petitioner.   Examining the position from the legal standpoint the bench noted that in the face of the nature of the allegations levelled in the said anonymous complaint, it is is unable to figure out as to under which enabling provision of law the respondent Station House Officer Police Station Doda came to address this impugned communication on the pretext of a complaint against the petitioner to the respondent Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda.  The respondent no. 4 had not registered any FIR or even a preliminary inquiry into the matter so as to make formal and official the alleged exercise so undertaken on his part in addressing the impugned communication to the respondent no. 3 i.e. the Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda, the bench recorded.   "It is strange that the author of the anonymous complaint in the complaint has no where mentioned the fact as to why he/she has chosen to address the complaint directly to the Superintendent of Police, Doda and not to the Chief Engineer concerned and there is also no reference in the complaint that the complainant had in fact first apprised the Chief Engineer concerned or the superior officers of the petitioner about the alleged acts of omission and commission on the part of the petitioner related to his official status and position. This aspect does show that the said anonymous complaint was nothing but a set up aimed to harass a public servant", Justice Bharti observed.   Allowing the petition, the bench accordingly quashed the impugned communication issued by the Station House officer, Police Station Doda to the Executive Engineer, PHE Division Doda.

The Kerala High Court recently observed that constant and repeated taunts of the husband that his wife did not meet his expectations and comparisons with other women would amount to mental cruelty as contemplated under Section 10(x) of the Divorce Act, 1869 for the purpose of dissolution of marriage.A Division Bench of Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice C. S. Sudha observed that for the... The Kerala High Court recently observed that constant and repeated taunts of the husband that his wife did not meet his expectations and comparisons with other women would amount to mental cruelty as contemplated under Section 10(x) of the Divorce Act, 1869 for the purpose of dissolution of marriage. A Division Bench of Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice C. S. Sudha observed that for the conduct of a spouse to fall within the ground of cruelty, it should be 'grave and weighty' to the extent that the petitioner's spouse cannot be reasonably expected to live with the other spouse, and should be serious that "ordinary wear and tear of married life". "The constant and repeated taunts of the respondent/husband that the petitioner is not a wife of his expectations; the comparisons with other women etc. would certainly be mental cruelty which a wife cannot be expected to put up with." The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was solemnized in January 2019 and the petition for dissolution of marriage was filed within 10 months from the marriage. A decree of dissolution of marriage was granted by the lower court under section 10(vii) of the Indian Divorce Act i.e., non-consummation of marriage. Aggrieved by this decree, an appeal was filed by the husband alleging that the court below had erroneously concluded that the marriage has not been consummated and so granted the petitioner-wife a decree of dissolution under Section 10(vii) of the Act. Counsel appearing for the respondent-husband, Advocates Thushara James and Amal Darshan, contended that the point framed itself is incorrect, because, unless the petitioner pleads and proves willful abstinence/refusal by the respondent to consummate the marriage, she cannot succeed. However, the court below never went into the said aspect. Further, it was submitted that in the petition originally filed, the petitioner never had a case of non-consummation of marriage. It was also pointed out that there are no sufficient pleadings to establish the grounds under section 10(vii) of the Act.  However, it was submitted by the counsel appearing for the petitioner, Advocates K.P. Sreeja and M. B. Sandeep, that the omission of the incorporation of the ground under Section 10(vii) in the petition initially filed was an inadvertent mistake on the part of the counsel. Further, the counsel contended that necessary pleadings have been brought in by way of the amendment carried out, which amended pleadings contain the necessary ingredients to make out a case under Section 10(vii) of the Act.  The petitioner had also challenged the findings of the lower court rejecting the ground of cruelty raised under Section 10(x) of the Act. The petitioner contended that under Order XLI Rule 24 and Rule 33 give ample power to this Court to "resettle the issues and determine the case for meeting the ends of justice" and the Court sided with the contention raised by the petitioner. In the petition, the petitioner had referred to instances of physical cruelty as well as mental cruelty. It was alleged that the respondent, a man of short temper, was a person who gets easily provoked. He used to pick quarrels with the petitioner even on trivial matters. When he loses his temper, he turns violent and physically assaults his family members. Yet another allegation against the respondent was that he was always in the habit of belittling and humiliating the petitioner by comparing her with other women. The Court while answering the question as to whether the conduct of the respondent amounts to cruelty, referred to a number of Apex Court decisions and observed that it is difficult to give a comprehensive definition of cruelty, as it changes according to the changes and advancement of social concepts and standards of living.  "Continuous ill-treatment, cessation of marital intercourse, studied neglect, indifference on the part of the husband, and an assertion on the part of the husband that the wife is unchaste, are all factors which lead to mental or legal cruelty."  Reliance was placed on Shoba Rani v. Madhukar Reddi, in which the concept of cruelty was examined in the context of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, the Court observed that cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or unintentional. If it is physical, it is a question of fact and degree. If it is mental, the enquiry must begin as to the nature of the cruel treatment and then as to the impact of such treatment on the mind of the spouse. Whether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious to live with the other, ultimately, is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the nature of the conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse.  It has been further held that the cruelty alleged may largely depend upon the type of life, the parties are accustomed to or their economic and social conditions and their culture and human values to which they attach importance. The Court, therefore, observed that since each case has to be decided on its own merits, it would be better to place less reliance upon precedents.  A set of facts stigmatized as cruelty in one case may not be so in another case. The cruelty alleged may largely depend upon the type of life the parties are accustomed to or their economic and social conditions. It may also depend upon their culture and human values to which they attach importance. Judges and lawyers, therefore, should not import their own notions of life. It would also be better there  is less reliance upon precedents.  The Court further observed that to constitute cruelty, the conduct complained of should be "grave and weighty" so as to come to the conclusion that the petitioner's spouse cannot be reasonably expected to live with the other spouse. It must be something more serious than "ordinary wear and tear of married life".  The conduct, taking into consideration the circumstances and background has to be examined to reach the conclusion whether the conduct complained of amounts to cruelty in the matrimonial law, opined the Court.  Furthermore, it was observed by the Court that physical violence is not absolutely essential to constitute cruelty and a consistent course of conduct inflicting immeasurable mental agony and torture may well constitute cruelty within the meaning of Section 10 of the Act.  "Mental cruelty may consist of verbal abuses and insults by using filthy and abusive language leading to constant disturbance of mental peace of the other party and in the present case from the pleadings and testimonies adduced before the Court, the Court observed that the petitioner cannot be expected to put up with the demeaning attitude and behaviour of the respondent towards her." However, the Bench added that there may be cases where the conduct complained of itself is bad enough and per se unlawful or illegal. Ins uch cases, the impact or the injurious effect on the other spouse does not have to be enquired into or considered; cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is proved or admitted.  "The absence of intention should not make any difference in the case, if by ordinary sense in human affairs, the act complained of could otherwise be regarded as cruelty. Intention is not a necessary element in cruelty. The relief to the party cannot be denied on the ground that there has been no deliberate or wilful ill-treatment." Since the matrimonial bond between the parties seemed beyond repair and the marriage between the parties was only in name and the marriage has been wrecked beyond the hope of salvage, public interest and interest of all concerned lies in the recognition of the fact, the Court opined that to keep the sham is obviously conducive to immorality and potentially more prejudicial to the public interest than a dissolution of the marriage bond. Thereby, the Court dismissed the appeal but modified the decree granted by the Lower Court for dissolution of marriage as one under Section 10(x) of the Act. Case Title: xxxxxxxx v. xxxxxxxxxx  
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has observed that there is no need to obtain the previous sanction to prosecute bank officials in connection with offences under IPC/RPC. The Bench of Justice Sanjay Dhar also observed that the appointing and removing the authority of the officials of the petitioner Bank is not the Government but it is the competent authority of the State Bank of India that is empowered to do so and therefore, Section 197 of the CrPC [Prosecution of Judges and public servants] are not attracted to the case of bank officials. The case in brief Essentially, a complaint was filed by the respondent-complainant before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Anantnag, seeking a direction for conducting enquiry/registration of FIR against the officials of the State Bank of India, Branch office Anantnag. It was alleged that the officials/unknown persons operated the complainant's bank account illegally, thereby inflating the bank account without the knowledge of the complainant, and fictitious entries/transactions were made in the account head of the complainant. The Magistrate, after coming to the conclusion that the matter was required to be inquired into, forwarded the complainant of the respondent/complainant to the police for conducting preliminary verification. Challenging the order and the complaint, the officials of the petitioner Bank argued that being public servants, cognizance of offences against them cannot be taken by the Court without previous sanction and that this aspect of the matter had been ignored by the Magistrate. Court's order At the outset, the Court opined that the instant plea was premature as at the instant moment, not even process has been issued against the officials of the petitioner Bank, which meant that the Chief Judicial Magistrate had yet to make up his mind whether any offence is made out on the basis of the material before him. Further, regarding the contention of the absence of the previous sanction, the Court opined that the officials of the petitioner Bank come within the definition of the public servant as contained in Section 21 of IPC, but, the Court added, the officials of the bank are not the public servants who cannot be removed from their office save by or with the sanction of the Government. "...an official of the bank may qualify to be a public servant and for prosecuting such an official in connection with offences under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, a previous sanction has to be obtained but so far as prosecution of officials of the bank in connection with offences under I.P.C/RPC are concerned, no previous sanction is required," the court stressed before dismissing the plea.

Upholding the union government's Agnipath scheme for the armed forces, the Delhi High Court on Monday said it can conclusively state that the scheme was made in national interest to ensure that armed forces are better equipped.  Referring to the skirmishes on the borders, the division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that such transgressions exacerbate the need to have a leaner and fitter Armed Force which is capable of handling the mental and physical distress that accompanies service in the Armed Forces.  The court called the scheme a well thought out policy decision by the union government and said rather than focusing on the "alleged political motives" of the scheme, it is necessary to focus on the benefits that are being provided by it. It also said that policy decisions, particularly those which have wide-ranging implications on the nation's health and security, should be decided by bodies best suited to do so.  "It appears that the Government has been considering, for a long time, the possibility of creating an Armed Forces which consists of more youthful, agile, and physically adept individuals. Upon considering the opinions of experts bodies, defence personnel, and carefully studying the models adopted by other nations, it has decided to finally replace the prior mode of recruitment with the recruitment envisaged by the Agnipath Scheme. Considering that the stated objective of the Government is neither discriminatory nor mala fide, or arbitrary, this Court finds no reason to interfere with it."  Policy Decision The court said it is well settled that scope of judicial review does not extend to excessively questioning the policy decisions of the government, unless they are arbitrary, discriminatory or are based on irrelevant considerations. Relying on the various precedents on the question of court's interference on policy decisions, the bench said it is exceedingly clear that the court does not interfere with policy decisions pertaining to national security in normal course, as it is not best placed to take such decisions.  "Policy decisions with regard to national security are taken after careful consideration of the socio-political scenario of the country, along with the socio-political scenario of the border countries. Further, a measured analysis is undertaken when it comes to application of schemes propounded by other countries to the conditions in India. The Courts cannot and should not delve into the appropriateness of such policy decisions and, thus, endanger one of the most important aspects of the basic structure doctrine, i.e., the principle of separation of powers."  The court said that while exercising its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, it cannot consider alternatives to the Impugned Scheme. "The formulation of the Scheme is an exercise of the "sovereign policy-making functions" of the Central Government, which ought not to be interfered with unless on the settled principles discussed above," it added. The court added that policy decisions, particularly those which have wide-ranging implications on the nation‟s health and security, should be decided by bodies best suited to do so. It appears that the Government has been considering, for a long time, the possibility of creating an Armed Forces which consists of more youthful, agile, and physically adept individuals, it added. "Upon considering the opinions of experts bodies, defence personnel, and carefully studying the models adopted by other nations, it has decided to finally replace the prior mode of recruitment with the recruitment envisaged by the Agnipath Scheme. Considering that the stated objective of the Government is neither discriminatory nor mala fide, or arbitrary, this Court finds no reason to interfere with it," said the court. Salient Features However, the court went on to analyse the salient features of the scheme and said the Impugned Scheme, as stated, is a recruitment-generation scheme which will satisfy a large number of unemployed Indian youth and 25% of the Agniveers will be allowed to continue in the Armed Forces beyond the period of 4 years. "This has been done by the Government in order to meet the objective of creating an Armed Force which is agile, youthful, physically fit, and mentally alert. This will bring the Indian Armed Forces in line with nations such as the inter alia United States, United Kingdom, and France. The importance of creating such a force has also been brought to the attention of this Court," it added. The court further said Agniveer Scheme will increase the "leader to led" ratio from 1.1 to 1.28; a ratio that would inspire confidence, and would ease the pressure of the forces on ground. "Expert opinions have also been sought on the Impugned Scheme; who have in fact suggested the revamping of the existing in-take and retention scheme as well. Considering the fact that the laudable objective of maintaining national security is at the heart of the Impugned Scheme, this Court does not find it arbitrary, capricious or devoid of reason." The court also noted that a number of Agniveers will be absorbed by the Public Sector Undertakings and other government establishments on various posts. They would also be given various certificates which would enable them to secure a job in the government and PSUs, said the court. "Working with the Army for four years will definitely instil a feeling of nationalism in the Agniveers which is important for the youth of the country. This feeling of nationalism will be a major deterrent for these persons from resorting to crime in the future," said the court. The court further observed that four years training period would also instil a sense of nationalism in these personnel that would more or less prompt them to use their skills and focus on the development of the country. "Such advantages cannot be overlooked and dislodged on the basis of the apprehension that after four years such individuals may be unemployed or the mere apprehension that they may take to illegal or unethical activities, after being trained in the Army. This Impugned Scheme cannot be interfered with by this Court only on the basis of such apprehensions and bald averments," it added. On the argument that Agniveers would not be given pension at the end of four years, the court said: "Such pension, it has been contended, is being extended to soldiers from other nations which have deployed similar short term services in the Armed Forces. However, the Petitioners have failed to realise that a principal distinction between nations such as Israel, which have deployed such a policy, and India, is that the Indian Government has not made it mandatory for the youth of the nation to serve in the Armed forces."  The court rejected the argument that the Government has failed to make provisions for the meaningful employment of Agniveers in the future.  "As stated earlier, the Government has in fact sought to extend entrepreneurship financial schemes such as MUDRA and Start-Up India to Agniveers as well. Furthermore, the Government has avowed to give Agniveers priority in government organisations; 10% reservation has been made for Agniveers in the Department of CAPF under the Ministry of Home Affairs, 10% in all the Departments under the Ministry of Defence, and 5% in all the Departments under the Railways. Material on record also discloses that the Impugned Scheme will not only provide opportunity for youth to serve the country but will also result in the Armed Forces having the most capable individuals who will be rewarded with a decent financial package and a bright future." Title: HARSH AJAY SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA AND ORS and other connected matters    
The Kerala High Court recently said that when an original petition is converted to a suit as contemplated under Rule 26 of the Indian Succession Rules (Kerala), 1968, the court fee has to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act.  A trial court had earlier directed a plaintiff to pay court fees under Section 25(a) of the Act read with Article 1 Schedule I of the Court Fees Act, even after conversion of original petition to suit. However, Justice C.S. Dias said the same is incorrect and wrong. The court said Chapter VI of the Kerala Court-Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959 deals with the manner in which court fee is to be computed and paid on applications filed for probate, letter of administration and certificate of administration. "The above provisions clearly specify that whenever an application for the grant of probate or letters of administration is filed, the same has to be accompanied by a valuation statement of the estate in the form set forth in Part I of Schedule III of the Court Fees Act, and court fee is to be paid under Article 6 of Schedule I of the Court Fees Act," it added. However, the court added that whenever there is a contest, the court fee is to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act.  "So, in an uncontested application falling under Section 56 of the Court Fees Act, the court fee is to be paid under Article 6 of Schedule I of the Act and in a contested application, the court fee is to be paid under Article 11 (k) of Schedule II of the Act, i.e., one half of the scale of fees prescribed under Article 1 of Schedule I of the Court Fees Act". Senior Advocate N.N. Sugunapalan and Advocate S. Sujin appeared on behalf of the petitioners. The respondents were represented by Advocates Legith T. Kottakkal and Kodoth Sreedharan.

The Supreme Court observed that no mandamus can be issued to the State Government to provide for reservation.The bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed thus while quashing a direction issued by Punjab and Haryana High Court to provide for a sports quota of 3% in Government Medical/Dental Colleges in the State of Punjab.In this case, the High Court of Punjab... The Supreme Court observed that no mandamus can be issued to the State Government to provide for reservation. The bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed thus while quashing a direction issued by Punjab and Haryana High Court to provide for a sports quota of 3% in Government Medical/Dental Colleges in the State of Punjab. In this case, the High Court of Punjab & Haryana  allowed writ petitions and directed the State to issue a  notification providing for 1% reservation/quota for children/grand children of terrorist affected persons/Sikh riots affected persons in all private unaided non-minority Medical/Dental institutions in the State of Punjab. The court further directed that the said reservation/quota shall apply to management quota seats as well. It further directed that the fresh notification shall also provide for a sports quota of 3% in Government Medical/Dental Colleges. The State of Punjab challenged this judgment before the Apex Court. The issue considered by the Apex Court bench was whether the State Government's action taking a policy decision to prescribe a particular percentage of reservation/quota for a particular category of persons, can be interfered with by issuance of a writ of mandamus, directing the State Government to provide for a particular percentage of reservation for a particular category of persons other than what has been provided in the policy decision taken by the State Government? The court referred to the following judgments on this aspect: (i) Gulshan Prakash (Dr.) and others v. State of Haryana and others, reported in (2010) 1 SCC 477 (para 27); (ii) Chairman and Managing Director, Central Bank of India and others v. Central Bank of India SC/ST Employees Welfare Association and others, reported in (2015) 12 SCC 308 (para 26); (iii) Suresh Chand Gautam v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported in (2016) 11 SCC 113 (para 49); and (iv) Mukesh Kumar and another v. State of Uttarakhand and others, reported in (2020) 3 SCC 1 (paras 18 & 19). The court noted that the above judgments have held that no mandamus can be issued by the Court directing the State Government to provide for reservation.  "It was further observed that even no writ of mandamus can be issued directing the State to collect quantifiable data to justify their action not to provide for reservation. It was observed that even if the under-representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in public services is brought to the notice of the Court, no mandamus can be issued by the Court to the State Government to provide for reservation.", the bench noted. Therefore, while allowing the appeal, the court observed thus: 9. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand, we are of the opinion that the High Court has committed a grave error in issuing a writ of mandamus and directing the State Government to provide for 3% reservation/quota for sports persons, instead of 1% as provided by the State Government. A conscious policy decision was taken by the State Government to provide for 1% reservation/quota for sports persons. A specific order dated 25.07.2019 was also issued by the State Government. Therefore, the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction while issuing a writ of mandamus directing the State to provide a particular percentage of reservation for sports persons, namely, in the present case, 3% reservation instead of 1% provided by the State Government, while exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court insofar as directing the State to provide for 3% reservation for sports persons and/or provide for a sports quota of 3% in the Government Medical/Dental Colleges is unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.

The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday rejected a plea to transfer a case to another court on the ground that the Magistrate presently hearing the case had met a Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) leader in his chamber.  Justice Karunesh Singh Pawar observed that just because the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) met a political leader, it cannot be the sole ground for transferring or withdrawing a case from a particular court.  "The Executive Officers such as Sub-Divisional Magistrate also do various administrative functions wherein they are supposed to meet the general public in day to day basis for discharging his duties and regular Tehsil Divas are hosted in every Tehsil at least once in a week where the general member of public come and meet him. This ground alone cannot be a ground for transferring or withdrawing the case from a particular court", the Court opined.  The plea moved by one Himanshu Singh sought to quash of the order dated September 22, 2021, passed by the court of District Magistrate, Bahraich which had rejected the petitioner's prayer to seek transfer of the proceedings to any other SDM Magistrate.  It was pointed out to the Court that such a transfer application had been filed under Section 411 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was filed on the ground that the husband of opposite party no. 2 namely Udai Pratap Singh is a local BJP leader and has contested elections as a member of the Jila Panchayat from ward no. 46 of Visheshwarganj, District Bahraich. It was further averred that he frequently meets the concerned Sub-Divisional Magistrate in his chamber.  As a result, the petitioner submitted that he is under a legitimate apprehension that he may not get justice from the SDM before whom the proceedings under Section 145 CrPC are pending.  On the other hand, the Additional Government Advocate contended that apart from the 'bald assertion' no material had been placed by the petitioner before the Court to support such a contention.  Agreeing with the submission, the Court noted that the petitioner's contentions are not supported with any material to substantiate these his pleadings.  "However, he has not filed any material in support of this case to show as to why he will not get justice", the Court added further.  Accordingly, the plea was rejected with the direction that pending proceedings under Section 145 CrPC shall be expedited at an early date.  "The impugned order does not suffer from any illegality as while passing the impugned order the District Magistrate Bahraich has recorded the reasons as to why the prayer of the petitioner has been rejected. I am satisfied with the reasoning recorded by the District Magistrate. The petition lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed," the Court directed.  Case Title: Himanshu Singh v.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that there is existing social stigma associated with the offence of rape and accordingly held that a delay in lodging FIR in cases of such nature would not vitiate the prosecution case.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that there is existing social stigma associated with the offence of rape and accordingly held that a delay in lodging FIR in cases of such nature would not vitiate the prosecution case.  The Court accordingly upheld the conviction of a man for raping a minor victim aged 14 years who had subsequently given birth to a still born child.  A Bench comprising Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Bivas Pattnayak observed that it is apparent that the victim did not inform anyone about the crime due to continuous threats by the appellant and that she had proceeded to lodge the police complaint only after her pregnancy was discovered.  "I am also not unmindful of social stigma attached to the nature of the offence which might have also attributed to the delay in lodging FIR. Even otherwise, the mere factum of delay in filing complaint in regard to an offence of this nature by itself would not be fatal so as to vitiate the prosecution case", the Court underscored.  Further the Court observed that there is no evidence of concoction of a false version or embellishment and accordingly dismissed contentions pertaining to the delay lodging of an FIR.  Background  In the instant case, the appellant had challenged the order of conviction issued by the Sessions Court under Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act) and under Sections 448 (house trespass) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and 376 (2)(i) (rape on a woman when she is under 16 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC).  The appellant used to come to the house of the victim for the last 7 years and would even refer to the victim as his 'grand-daughter'. Taking advantage of the absence of other family members, the appellant had trespassed into the house of the victim and had forcibly committed rape on her repeatedly on different occasions for the last 6-7 months. Thereafter, the minor victim had herself lodged a compliant against the appellant on June 10, 2014.  Due to the offence of rape, the minor victim had subsequently conceived and given birth to a still born child on August 29, 2014.  Observations  Although the Court acknowledged that there has been delay in lodging the FIR, it rejected the contention of the appellant that the case of the prosecution is shrouded with suspicion as there is immense delay in lodging of the FIR.  The Court observed that the victim in the written complaint as well as in her statement under section 164 CrPC has consistently stated of continuous threatening by the appellant.  "The evidence of the victim girl and other evidence as discussed above unerringly point to the guilty of the appellant as the person who ravished the victim on several occasions by entering into their house during the absence of other family members resulting in her pregnancy and also of threatening the victim with consequences to kill her and her family members in order to coerce her from disclosing such fact to her family members", the Court held.  Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgment in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh and Others wherein the Apex Court had observed, "The courts cannot overlook the fact that in sexual offences delay in lodging FIR can be due to variety of reasons particularly the reluctance of the prosecutrix or her family members to go to the police and complain about the incident which concerns the reputation of the prosecutrix and the honour of her family. It is only after giving cool thought that a complaint of sexual offence is generally lodged." The Court further noted that only after a Councillor from Childline spoke to the minor victim did she agree to lodge a complaint. "Therefore it is quite apparent from the above evidence that the victim did not inform about the incident due to continuous threatening by the appellant and only when her pregnancy was discovered, she lodged the complaint", the Court observed further.   It was further noted that although no DNA test had been done on the delivered child due to a lapse on the part of the investigating officer, however, this could not be a ground to discredit the testimony of the victim girl. "The victim girl had no control over the investigating agency and any negligence of the investigating officer cannot affect the credibility of the evidence of the victim girl", the Court underscored further.  Accordingly, the Court upheld the conviction of the appellant and further held that the minor victim is entitled to compensation under the 'Victim Compensation Scheme'.  Case Title: Md.

The Delhi High Court has granted interim injunction in favour of Star India Pvt. Ltd., restraining certain 'rogue websites' from streaming, broadcasting or sharing through the internet the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021. Star India claims to have acquired exclusive global media rights for various ICC events from the International Cricket Council for a duration of eight years i.e., from 2015–2023. It has filed a suit to seeking to permanently restrain the Defendants from infringing its exclusive rights and broadcasting reproduction rights, rendition of accounts, damages etc. Observing that a prima facie case is made out in Star India's favour, Justice Sanjeev Narula directed the Internet Service Providers to block access to the seven websites within 72 hours and also directed Department of Telecommunications and Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology to issue notification calling upon the internet and telecom service providers to block access to said websites. The seven rogue websites as mentioned by the media company are filmyclub.wapkiz.com, ipl.hitcric.tv, doratv-ipl.wapkiz.com, tamilblasters.win, thdtvworld.xyz, uptomovie.xyz and zolhdtv.com. During the course of hearing, Senior Advocate Amit Sibal appearing for the plaintiffs submitted that the defendants had earlier also infringed their exclusive rights for 'Vivo IPL 2021'. It was the apprehension of the plaintiffs that the defendants will continue infringing their exclusive rights with respect to the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021 that commenced from 17th October, 2021. Screenshots of one of the "rogue websites" were also annexed with the plaint to demonstrate that it mentions various sporting events to be held/ streamed on the website, including ICC Men's CWC. It was argued by the plaintiffs that the information regarding the defendant-websites was completely masked and that they were not aware of the owners of the websites as they were either anonymous or had incorrect addresses. "..prima facie, sufficient material has been placed on record by the Plaintiffs, this Court finds a prima facie case in favour of the Plaintiffs. The balance of convenience also lies in favour of the Plaintiffs and in case an ex-parte ad- interim injunction is not granted, an irreparable loss will be inflicted upon the Plaintiffs. Consequently, till the next date of hearing before this Court, interim injunction is granted in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendants," the Court ordered. The matter will now be heard on 28th February, 2022. Case Title: STAR INDIA PVT. LTD. AND ANR. v. FILMYCLUB.WAPKIZ.COM AND ORS.

The Supreme Court reiterated that the summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter.  Criminal Law cannot be set into motion as a matter of course and that magistrate while ordering summons has to record his satisfaction about a prima facie case against the accused, the bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed. In this case, a private complaint was lodged by a person against a company, its director and other functionaries alleging offences punishable under Sections 406, 418, 420, 427, 447, 506 and 120B read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The Magistrate issued the process against the accused. Later, the Sessions Court set aside this order, and the same was upheld by the High Court, by dismissing the revision petition filed by the complainant. In appeal, the complainant contended that at the stage of summoning the accused, what is required to be considered is whether a prima facie case is made out on the basis of the statement of the complainant on oath and the material produced at this stage and the detailed examination on merits is not required. On behalf of the accused, it was contended that that issuing summons/process by the Court is a very serious matter and therefore unless there are specific allegations and the role attributed to each accused more than the bald statement, the Magistrate ought not to have issued the process. The court noted that, except the bald statement that accused have conspired with common intention to lay the pipeline within the schedule properties belonging to the complainant, without any lawful authority and right whatsoever and in furtherance they have committed to trespass into the schedule properties of the complainant and demolished the compound wall, there are no other allegations that at that time they were present. The court also noticed the observations made in judgments viz. Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, (2008) 5 SCC 668 Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate, (1998) 5 SCC 749 GHCL Employees Stock Option Trust v. India Infoline Limited, (2013) 4 SCC 505; and Sunil Bharti Mittal v. Central Bureau of 10 Investigation, (2015) 4 SCC 609. "The learned Magistrate has to record his satisfaction about a prima facie case against the accused who are Managing Director, the Company Secretary and the Directors of the Company and the role played by them in their respective capacities which is sine qua non for initiating criminal proceedings against them. Looking to the averments and the allegations in the complaint, there are no specific allegations and/or averments with respect to role played by them in their capacity as Chairman, Managing Director, Executive Director, Deputy General Manager and Planner & Executor. Merely because they are Chairman, Managing Director/Executive Director and/or Deputy General Manager and/or Planner/Supervisor of A1 & A6, without any specific role attributed and the role played by them in their capacity, they cannot be arrayed as an accused, more particularly the cannot be held vicariously liable for the offences committed by A1 & A6.", the court said while dismissing the appeal.

The Bombay High Court has granted bail to a man from Parbhani, accused of taking an oath of allegiance to the banned terror organisation Islamic State and booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.  A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and VG Bisht granted bail to Mohammad Raisuddin noting that laboratories had given divergent views connecting "oath" document to the handwriting of the accused. Moreover, NIA did not tender the opinion in the accused's favour for over two years.   Even otherwise, the Oath declaring a former leader of the IS as the "caliph" of Muslims was not prima facie incriminating, the court said.   The bench said witness statements that the accused would regularly discuss beef ban, Dadri incident, Muzaffarpur incident, Gujarat riots, on Islam, and therefore they were jihadist and fundamentalists, was merely the witnesses opinion.   "From a perusal of the said statements, one can reasonably conclude that, at the highest, what took place were mere discussions as to what was transpiring in India and the world and that everyone should work for Islam. The said statements prima-facie cannot be said to be incriminating," the bench observed.   Various other factors that weighed in on the bench include, a co-accused with far more incriminating circumstances being released on bail last year, two other accused pleading guilty, prolonged incarceration and no prima facie case being made out.   The bench therefore said that the bar under Section 45(D) of UAPA wouldn't apply.   "Considering the material on record, we are prima facie of the opinion that the said circumstances relied upon by the prosecution, do not appear to be of such a nature so as to sustain a reasonable belief that the accusations against the appellant are prima facie true and hence, having regard to the same, the bar under Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA will not apply."   "Oath (Baith) allegedly written by the appellant, at the highest, appears to be a declaration of the acceptance of one Abi Bakar Al Baghdadi Al Hussaini Al Quraishi as the `Caliph' of the Muslims. Prima-facie, a perusal of the said Oath (Baith) does not appear to be incriminating."  The NIA alleged that Raisuddin and three others were planning to attack the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad's (ATS) Aurangabad Unit. Arrested in 2016, they were booked under several sections of the IPC for conspiracy and of the UAPA.  The agency further alleged Raisuddin 's co-accused was in touch with Islamic State members, and another had procured an IED. He is accused of being a co-conspirator as an oath of his allegiance was also found in a co-accused's house.  Raisuddin, was represented by Advocate Mubin Solkar. Solkar argued that the Oath, contents of which are easily available on the internet, was initially sent to State Examiner of Documents, Aurangabad but they could find an expert in Arabic/ Urdu to compare it with the handwriting specimens of the accused.   In 2017, Chief Examiner of Documents (CFSL) Hyderabad, had opined that for want of adequate specimen opinion couldn't be given. He submitted that the investigating agency misled this Court and suppressed the said report despite being repeatedly asked by this Court to produce the same.   Finally in 2019, the same documents were sent of CFSL Pune that gave an opinion in NIA's favour within two weeks.   "Be that as it may, there is variance in the opinion given by the two Forensic Labs, on the said document in question," the court noted.   The bench further observed that while one accused was granted bail last year as 550 witnesses were cited, two others had pleaded guilty.   "We have very closely and meticulously gone through the statements of prosecution witnesses and have also given our findings as to their nature and contents thereof. Totality of the material gathered by the investigation agency qua appellant-accused and presented before us does not prima facie point out the involvement of the appellant-accused in the aforesaid offences."

The Karnataka High Court has dismissed a habeas corpus petition filed by a transgender person, seeking directions to the police to produce an 18-year old girl, alleged to be his partner.  A division bench of Justice B Veerappa and Justice K.S.Hemalekha dismissed the petition filed by the 23-year-old after the girl, who was produced in court, made a statement that petitioner is only her friend and she is not willing to go with the petitioner.  The petitioner, identifying as male, had submitted that the girl has been in a consensual relationship with him since 2019. Her parents did not approve her relationship with the petitioner since beginning and have resorted her to physical and emotional abuse for being in relationship with the petitioner.  He claimed that the girl, being unable to withstand the abuse inflicted on her, decided to leave her parents' house and came to the petitioner's house to stay with him on May 9, 2022. The next day, the police called the petitioner and informed that the girl's parents had filed a kidnapping case against him and therefore, asked the petitioner to bring her to the Police Station.  When the petitioner and the girl went to the police station, it is alleged that the family members forcefully separated her from the petitioner and took her away. It was submitted that the petitioner is unaware of the whereabouts of the girl and her safety and well being. The illegal and unlawful separation and confinement of the girl is without the authority of law and is in blatant violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  The police produced the girl along with her parents before the court. When a query was made by the Court, the girl stated that petitioner is only her friend and she is not willing to go with petitioner and denied the allegation made in the writ petition that she is in consensual relationship with the petitioner since 2019 and further stated that she is willing to stay with her parents. The statement was made in the presence of counsel for the petitioner, Government Advocate and respondent Nos.3 and 4 (her parents).  Following which the court dismissed the petition as not maintainable. It even issued a warning to the petitioner by saying, "Though we were inclined to impose cost, at the intervention of learned Senior Counsel, we deem it proper to dismiss the writ petition, with a warning to the petitioner not to repeat such acts of violating the rights of a person as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, in future."

The Gujarat High Court has affirmed that "in deciding the bail applications an important factor which should certainly be taken into consideration by the court is the delay in concluding the trial."  Observing thus, the Bench comprising Justice Gita Gopi granted bail to an accused under the Central Goods & Services Act, 2017. "Here, taking into consideration the course of investigation adopted by the Department, the evidence, so collected, the trial will take considerable time and it may happen, if denied bail, the judicial custody be prolonged beyond the statutory period of punishment which is for five years," it remarked.  The Applicant-accused herein sought regular bail under Section 439 CrPC, in connection with offences under sections 132(1)(b), 132(1)(c) read with section 132(1)(i) and section 132(5) of the and section 132(1)(b), 132(1)(c) read with section 132(1)(i) and section 132(5) of the Gujarat GST Act, 2017 and section 120(B) of the IPC.  The case pertained to creation of shell companies, passing on inadmissible Input Tax Credit ('ITC') by issuing invoices without any actual supply of goods. The Applicant was accused of unauthorizedly receiving and utilizing ITC of INR 10.29 crores, passing of fraudulent ITC to its buyers by way of creating a chain of bogus firms without physical receipt and supply of goods. Accordingly, the Applicant was arrested in September 2021 under Section 69 of the CGST Act 2017 wherein he was sent to judicial custody. Subsequently, his bail plea was rejected under Section 437 of CrPC. Later, the criminal miscellaneous application was also rejected in October 2021.  The foremost contention of the Applicant was that he was arrested without any basis or evidence. Further, he was engaged in the business of ferrous scrap, iron etc and was holding registration under the erstwhile VAT regime and thereafter the GST regime under Section 139 which showed that he was a tax paying citizen and his business was not merely conducted on paper.  Even during the de-sealing procedure, the officers also found stock containing iron scrap at the business premises of the Applicant which was supported by legal and valid documents and invoices. An additional averment was that the GST Act was a fiscal statute and the object of the statute was to provide a mechanism to recover the amount payable to the Government under Section 69(1). Yet, no such steps were taken by the Government.  Per contra, the Respondent Authority contested that the iron scrap in the Applicant's shop premises was without stock register, which was mandatory under Section 35 of the CGST Act. Accordingly, the goods were seized under Section 67 of the Act. Attempts were also made to locate the principal place of business but the location could not be found. Hence, it was concluded that this entity did not exist.  Findings At the outset, the Court noted that trial in this case will take its own time to conclude. Reiance was placed on Sanjay Chandra Vs. CBI, [2012 1 SCC 40] where the Supreme Court had observed that in deciding bail applications, 'delay in concluding the trial' must be considered as a relevant factor. The Bench then referred to Section 138 of the CGST Act which makes provision for compounding of offences even after institution of prosecution, on payment by the person accused of the offence. In this backdrop, the Court averred, "Taking into consideration the provisions of law and the fact that the Commissioner is empower to recover the due amount and propose for abating the proceedings and as the trial will take its own time to conclude, this Court finds this to be a fit case where discretion could be exercised in favour of the applicant." The bail plea was this allowed subject to furnishing a personal bond of INR 1,00,000 with one surety of like amount.

The Allahabad High Court recently explained the scope and necessary ingredients of an order drawn under Section 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by an Executive Magistrate.It may be noted that when an Executive Magistrate, upon consideration of such information that there is a likelihood of a breach of the peace by a person, is satisfied that it is necessary to proceed against that... The Allahabad High Court recently explained the scope and necessary ingredients of an order drawn under Section 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by an Executive Magistrate. It may be noted that when an Executive Magistrate, upon consideration of such information that there is a likelihood of a breach of the peace by a person, is satisfied that it is necessary to proceed against that person under the relevant sections (Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. as the case may be), then the Executive Magistrate has to first issue a show caused notice to that person under Section 111 CrPC so that he/she can be given a chance to negate the allegations or offer his explanation. However, there are certain ingredients of this provision that are required to be fulfilled by the EM before he can issue an order under Section 111 CrPC against a person. In this regard, stressing that the order under section 111 Cr.P.C. must be in a writing, the Bench of Justice Gautam Chowdhary further specified the following broad elements of an order drawn under this section: The substance of the information received under Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. (as the case may be), Upon consideration of such information, he has formed the opinion that there is a likelihood of a breach of the peace and that it is necessary to proceed under the relevant sections (Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. as the case may be). He is not bound to draw up order under Section 111 Cr.P.C. merely because he has received a Police Report or other information, The amount of the bond to be executed, The term for which the bond is to remain in force, The number, character, and class of sureties if any required Essentially, the Bench was dealing with an application filed under section 482 Cr.P.C. by one Titu with a prayer to quash the notice issued against him on January 3, 2022, by Sub Divisional Magistrate (S.D.M.), Bahjoi, Sambhal under section 111/110 (G) CrPC. In the said notice, he had been asked to show cause why he may not be required to furnish personal bonds of Rs.50,000/- and two sureties in the like amount for maintaining peace and good conduct for a period of one year. Challenging the notices, the applicant argued that in the notice, it had been mentioned that he is an addicted gambler and person of criminal in nature, however, it didn't contain the details of the criminal charges pending against him and even the substance of the information against him had not been mentioned. At the outset, the Court stressed that while issuing an order under Section 111 CrPC, the first thing that a Magistrate must do after receipt of the information referred to in Sections 107 to 110 of Cr.P.C. is to apply his mind to such information and, if he is satisfied that there is ground for proceeding under the chapter, to pass an order in writing under section 111 Cr.P.C. Now, the Court further observed that the basic object of the preliminary order being to give the person proceeded against an opportunity to meet the allegation made against him as well as the nature of the order proposed. "The order contemplated under Section 111 Cr.P.C. requires application of mind and has to be prepared and drawn up cautiously and carefully in compliance with the provisions of section 111 Cr.P.C. and the order must contain reasons of the Magistrate satisfaction. The substance of the information is the matter upon which he has to issue show cause notice. If the substance of information is not given in the order under Section 111 Cr.P.C. the person against whom the order has been made may remain in confusion and may not be able to give an explanation," the Court added. Against this backdrop, noting that the substance of the information set forth in the notice was vague and ambiguous, the Court allowed the petition under Section 482 and the order of notice issued by the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Sambhal, PS Bahjoi, District Sambhal under Section 111/110 (G) Cr.P.C. was quashed.  However, the Sub Divisional Magistrate was given the liberty to draw fresh proceedings against the applicant in accordance with provisions of law.   
The Allahabad High Court has observed that sympathy or compassion does not play any role in the matter of directing or not directing re-evaluation of an answer sheets.  The Bench of Justice Manju Rani Chauhan further observed that sympathy or compassion does not play any role in the matter of directing or not directing re-evaluation of answer sheet.  The case in brief The Uttar Pradesh Higher Education Service Commission published an advertisement for filling the vacancies of Assistant Professor in various subjects. The petitioners applied for the post of Assistant Professor in Geography subject and examintation took place in written examination conducted on October 30, 2021. After the examination, the answer key inviting objections from the candidates in case of any wrong answer in the answer key was published by the Commission. The petitioners found that answers to 10 questions given in the answer key published by Commission were wrong, therefore, they raised their objections before the commission. Without considering the objections as raised by the petitioners, the results were declared by correcting one question. Now the candidates/petitioners came before the Court challenging the results.  They also sought a direction to the respondents to re-evaluate the answer sheets on the basis of the answers as given by the petitioners in the objections and again declare the results. Before the Court, they contended that the conduct of the commission to declare the result without considering the objections of the petitioners amounts to arbitrariness and hard-heartedness on their part. Therefore, it was submitted that the selection of the petitioners on the post of Assistant Professor (Geography) had been denied by not taking into consideration the objections as raised by the petitioners, which in case done, the petitioners would have succeeded. Court's observations At the outset, the Court stressed that the burden is always on the candidates, not only to demonstrate that the key answer is incorrect but also to show that it is a glaring mistake which is totally apparent and no inferential process or reasoning is required to show that the key answer is wrong.  Further, the Court opined that normally, the Constitutional Courts must exercise great restrain in such matters and should be reluctant to entertain a plea challenging the correctness of the key answers. The Court was also of the view that the Courts should not re-evaluate or scrutinize the answer sheets of the candidates as it has no expertise in the matter, and that the academic matters are best left to the academicians there being no scope of judicial review in the matter "The Court should not over step its jurisdiction by giving the directions for re-evaluation which would amount to judicially reviewing the decision of the expert in the field...Undoubtedly, the Courts cannot judicially review the expert opinion unless and until the key answer is patently wrong," the Court stressed. The Court also underscored that when a decision is taken by the Committee of Expert having high academic qualifications and long experience in the specialised field, the Courts should not normally interfere in the matters. "The Court has to proceed on the assumption and presumption that the answer key is correct as the same is based on experts opinion given by the persons specialised..." the court said as it found no good ground to interfere in the instant petition, the same was accordingly dismissed.

The Gujarat High Court has distinguished between the right of an 'intra-court appeal' under Article 226 and Article 227 of the Constitution and held that an intra-court appeal does not lie against the judgement of a Single Judge when the power of superintendence is exercised by examining the subordinate court's order.  In other words, Clause 15 of the Letters Patent Act, does not permit an appeal against the order passed by a Single Judge of the Court in an Art 227 petition.  Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Joshi stated: "Where a petition is filed both under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, it will have to be considered whether the point raised in the petition arose for adjudication for the first time before the High Court. If the challenge in the petition is with respect to the points already adjudicated upon by the subordinate court or tribunal, then it will have to be held that the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court was invoked and not the original jurisdiction." "Mere mentioning of the provision of Article 226 and without there being any fundamental and foundation facts specified, which may indicate that original jurisdiction is invoked would not alter the position." The instant intra-court appeal was filed under Articles 226 and 227 and were challenging the decision of the Single Judge Bench of the High Court in an SCA which had affirmed the order of the Additional District Judge in a Civil Suit. The suit pertained to the provisions of the Public Premises Act wherein the Petitioner had not commenced construction on the land allotted to him even after 6 years. Consequently, the Petitioner was required to vacate the wheat being stored in the land. The Estate Officer later commenced proceedings for the order of eviction as well. Herein, the maintainability of the appeal was challenged by the Respondents on the ground that the order passed by the Civil Court had already been challenged before the Single Judge Bench under Article 227. Per contra, the Petitioner averred that the order of the Single Judge was not passed under Article 227 alone but also under Article 226. Addressing this contention, the Bench explained that the order passed by the District Judge under the PP Act was in the capacity of the Appellate Court and therefore, the challenge before Single Judge would proceed under Art 227 only and not Art 226. Therefore, the LPA was not maintainable. Reliance was placed on Life Insurance Corporation of India Vs. Nandini J. Shah, case where the Apex Court had held: "Whether the learned Single Judge has exercised the jurisdiction under Article 226 or under Article 227 or both needless to emphasise, would depend upon various aspects that have been emphasised in the aforestated authorities of this Court. There can be orders passed by the learned Single Judge which can be construed as an order under both the articles in a composite manner, for they can co-exist, coincide and imbricate." Keeping in view these precedents, the High Court noted that at first the order was passed by the Estate Officer u/s 5(1) of the PP Act. Later, the appeal was preferred against the order u/s 9 of the Act. Referring to the LIC case, the High Court concluded that the 'Appellate Officer' as u/s 9 of the PP Act was not persona designate (persons selected to act in their private capacity and not as Judges) but rather a Civil Court since he acts as a Court and the order passed by him constitutes an order of the subordinate court. Against such an order, the remedy under Art 227 lies. Thus, the power of superintendence under Art 227 was exercised by the Single Judge and merely filing the petition under Art 226 would not alter the manner in which the powers have been exercised.  The Appellants had also filed an application for amendment of original pleadings to incorporate certain facts in the SCA. However, the same was not permitted by the High Court on account of delay without reasons. Accordingly, the appeal was rejected as not maintainable even as the option for challenging the order of the Single Judge was kept open.

The Delhi High Court has observed that allowing fabricated allegations against the entire family in matrimonial disputes may lead to further misuse of process of law. "If false implication by fabricated omnibus allegations against entire family in the course of matrimonial disputes and differences, is allowed, it may lead to further misuse of the process of law and assume serious... The Delhi High Court has observed that allowing fabricated allegations against the entire family in matrimonial disputes may lead to further misuse of process of law.  "If false implication by fabricated omnibus allegations against entire family in the course of matrimonial disputes and differences, is allowed, it may lead to further misuse of the process of law and assume serious proportions," Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta observed.  The Court made the observation while denying anticipatory bail to father of a married woman in an FIR registered under sec. 182, 192, 195, 203, 389, 420, 469, 470, 471, 500, 120B and 34 of IPC.  It was the case of the prosecution that the FIR was registered on the complaint of a mother in law alleging that her daughter in law, who was married to her elder son, was not willing to live with him and in order to extort money from them, she hatched a conspiracy in association with her family members including the petitioner father and her friend.  It was alleged that in order to execute the plan to disappear from the matrimonial home, she gave false information regarding her suicide. In between, the family members of daughter in law registered a case bearing under the Dowry Prohibition Act against their son in law and other family members. The complainant's son was consequently arrested and was then granted bail.  The Court noted that the son of the complainant remained in custody on the basis of fabrication of incident of disappearance made by his wife. It also noted that the interim protection to the wife was already declined by High Court during the pendency of her application for anticipatory bail.  "At this stage, it cannot be ignored that Komal Talan (wife) was in touch with the family members during the aforesaid period and consequently Abhishek Kumar (husband) remained in custody. Also, the matter appears to have been highlighted in media on the basis of alleged suicide note, which the prosecution seeks to recover," the Court said.  The Court observed that in order to wreak vengeance for oblique motive, the incident of alleged suicide was fabricated and that the same not only led to adverse media coverage, caused misery to the family of complainant but also resulted in undue incarceration of the husband.  "The criminal proceedings were initiated as a gross abuse of the process of law. The implication and consequences of such conduct may not have been fully visualized by the petitioner at the aforesaid time but the uncalled for detention of Abhishek Kumar definitely ruined the chances of settlement. The law appears to have been used as a weapon than a shield by fabricating the incident of disappearance and suicide," the Court observed.  It added "I am of the considered view that a serious view needs to be taken of such incidents to ensure that social fabric is not ruined by such fabrication of facts." Accordingly, the anticipatory bail plea was dismissed.  Case Title: ANIL KUMAR TALAN v. STATE (GOVERNMENT NCT OF DELHI)

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh has ordered the reopening of the infamous Nadimarg Massacre Case, after a decade, by recalling an order dated December 21, 2011 whereby the criminal revision petition in the matter was dismissed. The case relates to massacre of 24 Kashmiri Pandits by militant groups at Nadimarg village in Shopian district in 2003. Seven persons were arraigned as accused in the matter. However, prosecution's plea to examine material witnesses on commission, citing threat perception, was dismissed by both the trial court was well as the High Court through the impugned order.   A bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar on Wednesday noted that the criminal revision petition was dismissed primarily because nobody had appeared on behalf of the State. It remarked, "A criminal revision petition cannot be dismissed for non-prosecution...this Court does have jurisdiction to recall an order which is a nullity in the eyes of law."  After the incident, a case (FIR No.24/2003) for offences under Sections 302, 450, 395, 307, 120-B, 326, 427 RPC, 7/27 Arms Act and Section 30 Police Act) was registered in Police Station, Zainapora in connection with massacre and investigations were taken up.  Counsel for the petitioners contended that that the impugned order was sought to be recalled as it was passed without hearing the petitioner and without adverting to the merits of the case.  Contesting the plea, the respondents countered by arguing that that a criminal court has no jurisdiction to review its own order in view of the specific bar contained in Section 369 of the J&K Cr.P.C, which is applicable to the instant case.  Findings:  While Justice Dhar agreed that a Criminal Court including the High Court, in exercise of its criminal jurisdiction, does not have power to review its own order however, he added that a criminal revision petition cannot be dismissed for non-prosecution.  Justice Dhar further recorded that though the High Court, while dismissing the Criminal Revision Petition had observed that the order of the trial court is well-reasoned and does not call for interference, but the fact of the matter remains that the Court was persuaded to dismiss the revision petition, primarily, because nobody had appeared on behalf of the State. The impugned order does not specify the reasons as to why the revision petition lacks merit, the bench noted.  The bench explained that a criminal matter cannot be dismissed for default and that it must be decided on merits because such matters relate to administration of criminal justice.   In order to buttress the said position the bench also found it necessary to record the observations of Supreme court in State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar and others, (2011) wherein SC while while examining the bar to review/alteration of a judgment, in view of the provisions contained in Section 362 of the Central Cr. P. C, which is in pari materia with Section 369 of the J&K Cr. P. C, observed:  " If a judgment has been pronounced without jurisdiction or in violation of principles of natural justice or where the order has been pronounced without giving an opportunity of being heard to a party affected by it or where an order was obtained by abuse of the process of court which would really amount to its being without jurisdiction, inherent powers can be exercised to recall such order for the reason that in such an eventuality the order becomes a nullity and the provisions of Section 362 Cr.P.C. would not operate. In such eventuality, the judgment is manifestly contrary to the audi alteram partem rule of natural justice. The power of recall is different from the power of altering/reviewing the judgment"  The bench thus recalled the impugned order and directed the Registry to post the revision petition for rehearing on September 15.  Case Title: State Through P/S Zainapora Vs Zia Mustaffa    
The Calcutta High Court has recently held that the abscondence of an accused by itself does not establish his guilt and accordingly proceeded to set aside an order of conviction for the commission of the offence of murder under Section 302 of the IPC.  A Bench comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Ananya Bandyopadhyay was adjudicating upon an appeal preferred against an order of conviction passed against the appellant for murdering a 10 year old boy. It was alleged that the appellant had illicit relationship with Rasida, mother of the boy. It was further contended that the child had disclosed the illicit relationship to his father and accordingly appellant nursed a grudge against him. During the proceedings, it was contended on behalf of the prosecution that the appellant had gone missing from the mosque immediately after the incident and did not return to the village and that the appellant had been arrested later at Panskura railway station. The Court relied upon the Supreme Court judgment in Sk. Yusuf v. State of West Bengal to rule that it is a settled law that the abscondence of an accused by itself does not establish his guilt.  "The aforesaid proposition of law wholly applies to the facts of the present case. Evidence on record shows apart from vague suspicion owing to a hunch that the appellant may have nursed grudge against the child for divulging his illicit association with her mother, no evidence was led to show that the appellant had clear access to the child soon before his death so as to complete the chain of circumstances pointing to his guilt", the Court observed.  It was further noted that the father of the deceased had not initially lodged an FIR against the appellant and that only after a couple of days out of suspicion the appellant had been implicated in the instant case.  Opining further that there is a likelihood that the appellant had run away from the village out of fear and apprehension of false implication, the Court underscored,  "Under such circumstance, it is likely out of fear and apprehension of false implication and harassment the appellant may have ran away from the village and secreted himself. Abscondence of the appellant when judged in the backdrop of the fact and circumstance of the case cannot by any stretch of imagination be treated to be conclusive evidence with regard to his guilt." Accordingly, the Court held that the appellant has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the appellant is entitled to an order of acquittal. Case Title: Md. Firoz Ala @ Firoj Alam v. State of West Bengal    
The Gujarat High Court recently reiterated the settled proposition of law that the amount of Public Provident Fund account shall not be liable to any attachment in respect of any debt or liability incurred by the account holder. The Bench comprising Justice AS Supehia was hearing the case of a Petitioner who had invested Hindu Undivided Family's money under Centre's Public Provident Fund Scheme with the Respondent-Bank of Baroda.  The Petitioner was also a partner of Gujarat Steel and Pipes partnership firm and the said firm held a cash credit account with the Respondent-Bank. It was the Petitioner's case that the PPF Account was opened with the Central Government through the Respondent but the same was not connected with the cash credit account.  The Petitioner submitted that vide a notification by the Government of India under Section 15 of the Public Provident Fund Act, it was clarified that any amount standing in the PPF Account shall not be liable to any attachment in respect of any debt incurred by the account holder. Thus, the PPF account was protected against any kind of recovery. Due to the economic conditions prevailing in the pandemic, the Petitioner wanted to withdraw the fund lying in the PPF Account. However, the Respondent Bank 'illegally and without the consent of the Petitioner' debited the amount of Rs. 85,380 from his PPF Account to the cash credit account of his partnership firm.  Reliance was placed on Section 60(1) of the CPC which provides for the properties liable to be attached to contest that the debiting the amount from the PPF Account was de hors the procedure prescribed in law. Reference was made to Dineshchandra Bhailalbhai Gandhi Vs. Tax Recovery Officer, 2014 S.C.C. OnLine Gujarat 15889, where it was held that PPF scheme was launched to provide for a social security and a fund to depend upon in old age; post-retirement. The High Court had further ruled,  "In turn, clause (ka) of the provision to Section 60 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that all deposits and other sums in or derived from any fund to which the Public Provident Fund Act, 1968 applies in so far as they are declaring by the said Act not to be liable to attachment, shall not be liable for attachment or sale under the Code."  Per contra, the Respondent Bank insisted that the Bank was forced to take this step for withdrawal of the amount since the Bank, along with the partners of the firm and other executed the General Form of Guarantee in 2018 for INR 24 lakhs. Therefore, the Petitioner along with other guarantors was liable to pay the entire debt due to the Respondent Bank.   Justice Supehia noted that it was not in dispute that the amount of Rs. 85,380 was withdrawn from the PPF Account of the Petitioner. However, it was settled law that the PPF Account could not be used towards any liability. Thus, this action of withdrawing the amount was illegal and unjustified.  Clarifying that the observations of the High Court should not be construed adverse to the Bank for any other proceedings for recovery, the Bench directed that the Bank to deposit the said amount within a period of 4 weeks in the name of the Petitioner's saving account.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the writ petition filed by journalist Rana Ayyub challenging the jurisdiction of a special court in Ghaziabad under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 to take cognisance of the complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate against her for alleged violations in amounts collected through crowdfunding for COVID relief. On January 31, a division bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and J.B. Pardiwala had reserved the verdict in a petition filed by Ayyub challenging the court summons against her on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad court. Senior Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing on behalf of the journalist, had argued that the Uttar Pradesh court had ‘absolutely no jurisdiction’ since no part of the alleged offence was committed in the state and that the alleged proceeds of crime are in an account maintained in Navi Mumbai. The bench has rejected this argument, while leaving it open to the petitioner to raise the issue before the trial court. Justice Ramasubramanian read out the operative portion of the order as follows : “Under Section 3 of PMLA, place where any of six activities or processes are carried out - concealment, possession, acquisition, use, projecting as untainted property, claiming as untainted property, the offence of money laundering is said to have taken place. Navi Mumbai, where the bank account is located, is the destination where the proceeds of crime have reached, if at all. The question as to whether any one or more of the six activities have taken place question of fact which has to be decided based on evidence. Therefore, we leave it open for this issue to be raised before the trial court. Petition dismissed.” Detailed judgment is yet to be uploaded. Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, appearing for the ED, had argued that the money laundering complaint has to be filed at the place where the scheduled offence has taken place. The ED initiated the investigation based on an FIR registered at Ghaziabad. He also argued that persons from UP and Noida have also donated for Ayyub's campaign and hence a part of the offence has taken place in that jurisdiction. He refuted Grover's argument that money laundering complaint can only be filed at a place where the proceeds of crime are found.  Ayyub came under the scanner of the federal agency for allegedly ‘cheating’ the public by misappropriating charitable donations worth Rs 2.69 crore and for receiving overseas donations without registration under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. The investigation was initiated on the strength of a first information report registered in September 2021 by the Indirapuram Police Station in Ghaziabad under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, and Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015. What was of interest to the law enforcement agency was a series of three campaigns launched since 2020 by the journalist on an online crowdfunding platform called Ketto to raise funds for slum-dwellers and farmers, relief work in Assam, Bihar, and Maharashtra, and for people impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in India.  In February, in the course of the investigation, bank balances in the accounts of Ayyub amounting to around Rs 1.77 crore, including a fixed deposit of Rs 50 lakh were attached by means of provisional attachment order. In March, the award-winning journalist was stopped by immigration officials at the Mumbai airport from taking a flight to London, on the basis of a ‘Look out Circular’ issued against her by the ED for allegedly failing to comply with their summons. The Delhi High Court, in April, quashed the circular, allowing Ayyub to travel abroad, and in August, restrained the federal agency from proceeding further with the provisional attachment of her properties in connection with the money laundering probe.  Finally, in October, the Enforcement Directorate concluded the investigation. “The investigation has established that Rana Ayyub had launched the fundraising campaigns with the sole intention to cheat the general public and acquired proceeds of crime in form of fixed deposits and balances in bank accounts projecting them as untainted,” the ED claimed in a statement on October 13, one day after it filed a charge-sheet against Ayyub before a special PMLA court in Ghaziabad under Section 45 read with Section 44 of the anti-money laundering act. Ayyub, a prominent critic of the current ruling dispensation, claimed that she was being targeted and intimidated for her work and for questioning the ruling regime. On November 29, the special court took cognizance of the prosecution complaint and summoned Ayyub to appear before the court on January 27. The journalist moved the top court in January praying for the proceedings initiated by the Enforcement Directorate in Ghaziabad to be quashed. The petitioner has, inter alia, cited the lack of jurisdiction of the special court in Ghaziabad since the alleged offence occurred in Mumbai.

The Gujarat High Court recently recommended that the State government take initiatives to implement the guidelines issued by the Apex Court in the DK Basu v. State of West Bengal and to install CCTV cameras with night vision and maintain their records for 6 months to deal with police atrocities in the region. A Bench comprising Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Mauna Bhatt was hearing a habeas corpus petition involving an inter-religious couple when it came down heavily on the Gujarat police and directed the concerned authorities to intimate all police stations about the guidelines issued in the Paramvir Singh Saini case. "We expect the State to complete the task of installing the new gadgets and also follow the directions of the Apex Court as earliest possible". The Court also opined that any incident of the alleged atrocities or involvement of the police officers in violation of mandatory guidelines shall at least be intimated to the Head of the District, i.e. to the Superintendent of Police or the Police Commissioner, as the case may be. However, since the matter was pending before the District Court, the Bench refused to intervene and granted liberty to the petitioner to take appropriate remedy through a personal complaint. Nevertheless, the High Court 'expected' the State to complete the task of installing new gadgets and following the directions of the Apex Court at the earliest.  The Petitioner herein had sought the direction that the Police Inspector (Respondent No. 2) release his son along with the girl he intended to marry from the Inspector's custody. It was averred that the action of Respondent No. 2 in detaining them was 'absolutely illegal.' The detenues had intended to marry each other under the Special Marriages Act and the notice was issued under Section 5. However, before the ceremony could be performed, Respondent No. 2 took both of them away and some of the family members were beaten up according to the petitioner.  It was also noted by the Bench that as soon as the habeas corpus petition was filed, they were released. Subsequently, the High Court was informed that the Superintendent of Police was conducting inquiry with utmost seriousness even as the girl agreed to join her parents out of her own volition. Therefore, the Court held that the petition did not survive as the corpus was no longer in illegal custody.  However, the Superintended of Police was required to remain present before the Court in the absence of any report produced before the Court.   While examining the petition, the Bench deemed it appropriate to examine the guidelines issued by the Home Department in relation to the preservation of CCTV camera footage when there are complaints against police officials. It observed that the camera footage was maintained for only a limited period of 30 days which was not in accordance with guidelines laid down by the Apex Court. The Bench remarked:  "It is admitted that the issue relating to the missing girls and the allegations of harassment by the police when are dealt with, the complaints regarding the missing persons have not been reported by a Special Report, however, the harassment by local police officers if comes to the knowledge of the Senior Officer and if it is escalated by complaint or it is brought to the knowledge of higher authority by the supervisory officer or SHO, the complainant can approach the Range Head or the Police Head i.e. the Director General and Inspector General of Police, Home Department, District Level Police Complaint Authority."  Placing reliance on the guidelines of 2018 which were issued b the Office of Director General and Inspector General of Police concerning the installation of the CCTV camera systems to prevent custodial violence, the High Court emphasised that the Superintended of Police or the Police Commissioner must monitor the footage at least once a week.   Reference was made to the PARAMVIR SINGH SAINI VS. BALJIT SINGH AND OTHERS, (2021) 1 SCC 184 and the DK Basu judgements for the guidelines enumerated by the Apex Court concerning CCTV camera systems in police stations. The Apex Court had laid down:  CCTV cameras should remain functional and that SHO must report to the authorities in case of fault in equipment in order to effectuate immediate repair or replacement. There should be regular maintenance of CCTV data, backup of data, fault rectification by the SHO.CCTV cameras must be installed at all entry, exit points, lock-ups, corridors, lobbies, reception areas, verandas, Inspector's room, station hall, station compound, outside washrooms etc. The cameras must be equipped with night vision and consist of audio and video footage. The records of the CCTV camera must be preserved for 18 months and not less than 1 year. In the instance, that force is used, the State Human Rights Commission should be immediately approached for redressal.The Union of India also directed CCTV cameras in the offices of CBI, NIA, ED, NCB,DRI and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and any other agency which carried out interrogations and had the power of arrest.

The Madras High Court recently observed that trial courts should refrain from acting solely on memo filed by the counsel of the party conceding the substantive right of the party viz-a-viz the subject matter of the suit, or right of defence, for passing any non-adjudicatory decree or appealable orders. Justice N Seshasayee observed that though there is not a complete ban on considering the memo filed by the counsel of the parties, what must be looked into is the effect that the memo and the consequential order will have on the rights of the parties.  The court also held that though a lawyer is authorized to act on behalf of his client through the Vakalatnama, there should be an express authority granted to him to enter into compromise and the same could not be implied.  The court further observed that the law in this regard was already settled through the decision of the Supreme court in Himalayan Coop. Group Housing Society v. Balwan Singh, [(2015) 7 SCC 373] where a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court held that An Advocate has no implied authority to concede the substantive rights of his client in a litigation. The court highlighted that even where the court chooses to act on a memo, it is required to evaluate the consequences of acting on such Memo. No Court, under any circumstances, should pass a decree or an order which it is not competent to pass, or which violates any of the mandatory provisions of law.  In the present case, a challenge was made against a decree passed by the Subordinate Court, Gudiyatham wherein the court acting upon an alleged memo filed by the counsel for the revision petitioner had decreed a suit. The revision petitioner contended that no such memo was filed on his behalf by the counsel and that the Court was tricked by Plaintiff in the suit (first respondent herein) to pass such order. The court held that even if it is assumed that the counsel for the revision petitioner (second defendant in the suit) had filed a memo, the subordinate court ought to have looked into the facts of the case and the previous proceeding. The court failed to consider the fact that the revision petitioner had impleaded himself into the suit stating that he was one of the absolute owners of the suit property. The court also should have considered the fact that in previous postings, the very same court was not inclined to allow the suit merely on an unregistered sale deed indicating its doubt over the right of the plaintiff to sustain his claim of declaration of title over the suit property. The court was, therefore, inclined to allow the revision petition and directed resumption of the suit from the date of carrying out the amendment in the plaint after the restoration of suit in 2015. Supervisory Power Under Article 227 One of the main challenges that was raised by the respondents was that the High Court did not have any power under Article 227 of the Constitution to travel into the domain of disputed facts. To this, the court discussed in detail the supervisory power under Article 227 of the Constitution. The court observed that the power of supervision under Article 227 is intended to secure and sustain the public faith in the judicial system. It may be understood as a duty to drone-cam the functioning of the courts subordinate to it to ensure that the quality of its functioning is effective and is worthy of sustaining the trust of the litigant public.  In the present case, the question was not whether the counsel had filed a memo before the trial court but how the trial court had approached the case. The court ought to have ensured the presence of the revision petitioner (second defendant) and should not have acted merely on a memo. Case Title: Abdul Rashid Sahib v.

The Gujarat High Court recently denied bail to an accused under the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Act, 2015, stating that accused was prima facie a part of an 'organised crime syndicate' involved in highway thefts.'Organized Crime Syndicate', defined under Section 2(1)(f) of the Act, means a group of two or more persons who, acting either singly or collectively, as a syndicate... The Gujarat High Court recently denied bail to an accused under the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Act, 2015, stating that accused was prima facie a part of an 'organised crime syndicate' involved in highway thefts. 'Organized Crime Syndicate', defined under Section 2(1)(f) of the Act, means a group of two or more persons who, acting either singly or collectively, as a syndicate or gang indulging in activities of organised crime. The Bench comprising Justice AS Supehia explained 'organized crime' as such continuing unlawful activity, indulged in by use of violence, threat, intimidation, coercion, or other unlawful means, with an objective of gaining pecuniary benefits/ undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person or for promoting insurgency. "Therefore, an 'organized crime' by nature of violent action indulged in by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of such syndicate should have been either with an object for making pecuniary gains or undue economic or other advantage or for promoting insurgency," it held. The Court further explained that mere indulgence in a violent activity etc. either for pecuniary gain or other advantage or for promoting insurgency as an individual, either singly or jointly as a member of 'organized crime syndicate' or on behalf of a such syndicate would be sufficient for bringing the said activity within the four corners of the definition of 'organized crime'. In the instant case, the Court noted that the accused seeking bail was the member of a gang involved in committing organized crimes like vehicle theft, stealing valuable muddamal on moving vehicles, violation of the Arms Act, violation of the Prohibition Act, causing injury, loot, robbery, extortion, gang rape, abduction, murder, attempt to murder, preventing public servant from discharging his duty, deadly attack on public servant and causing damage to public property. Further, applicant used to keep all muddamal articles, which were still in possession and used to help the accused to dispose of so that they could not be caught. In this backdrop, it was held, "there are at least 20 members involved in various offences. The complicity of the applicant can only be known after other members of the syndicate are apprehended and investigated by the policy authorities. Prima facie, the investigation reveals that the applicant is a member of the syndicate as she used to deal with the stolen articles, which were looted by the other accused from various highways of the State. The material on record reveals that prima facie the applicant along with other coaccused, who are relatives and family members, have formed an organised crime syndicate for committing the offences, and her role as alleged will satisfy the requirement of section 2(1)(a) which defines "abet"."  Background  Five FIRs were registered against the Applicant. It was alleged that she was a member of an "organised crime syndicate" that used to chase and recce vehicles passing on the Ahmedabad-Rajkot and Ahmedabad National Highways, including certain internal roads during night.  The Applicant contended that there five FIRs which were registered against the Applicant which were clubbed together for which separate trial will take place. Hence, she should not suffer under the rigour of the trial under the Act.  Senior Advocate Yatin Oza contended thatPer Article 20(2), she cannot be prosecuted more than once for the same offence. Except one offence registered under Section 207 of IPC in 2016, all other offences pertain to Section 379 and 413 of IPC which was not a serious offence. Further, it could not be said that she was engaged in unlawful activity of an organised crime, or she was part of an organised syndicate under 2(f) of the Act. Except an offence punishable under Section 413 of IPC, the Applicant was not named in the FIR, but she was named in supplementary chargesheets.  Additionally, all offences were registered on the statement of the co-accused which cannot be considered a substantial piece of evidence. Significantly, under Section 2(c) of the Act, filing more than one chargesheet for an offence punishable with more than 3 years imprisonment is not enough, but it must be satisfied that the unlawful activity is grave. She had been granted temporary bail by the High Court wherein she did not violate any condition. She also had a husband and a minor son who have been falsely encountered by the police. Lastly, dealing with stolen articles was a minor offence and did not attract the provisions of the Act.  Per contra, the Respondent contended that there were 20 other accused persons for the offences. The Applicant was part of an organised crime syndicate. She had also assaulted police authorities with a co-accused. There were 9 vehicles which were seized out of which one belonged to her. She was directly connected with the organised crime syndicate. She was involved in 93 offences while her brother was involved in 68.   Judgement  Justice Supehia, rejected the Article 20(2) contention stating that so long the provision remain in the statute (2015 Act), the Court cannot express or critcise its consequences being critical or in conflict with the provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution, more particularly while exercising powers under the provision of section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Prima facie, the Bench concluded, it seemed that the Applicant was part of a syndicate of 20 accused persons who were her relatives and family members. It referred to Prasad Shrikant Purohit vs State Of Maharashtra & Anr [(2015) 7 SCC 440] wherein the Supreme Court had explained the pari materia provisions of Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999 ['MCOCA']. The Apex Court had explained thus:  Justice Supehia opined that before the promulgation of the Act in 2019, the Applicant had been arraigned as an accused for provisions of Section 379 and 309 of IPC and after the promulgation in 3 offences under the same sections. The investigation is ongoing. Hence, the registration of offences on the same day cannot dilute the offence registered under the Act and this cannot be an ipso facto influence on the grant of bail.  Further agreeing with the definition of the Supreme Court of "organised crime", the Bench concluded that prima facie, the contents of the FIRs and chargesheet disclose that the Applicant was working in an organised crime syndicate.  In finality, the Bench explained that under Section 20(4) of the Act, there must be reasonable norms for believing that the accused was not guilty. However, looking at the role of the Applicant, the Bench could not be impressed from a prima facie perspective that the Applicant was not guilty. Accordingly, the Application was rejected.

Stating that many individuals on Youtube are propagating "wrong and deceitful" information, the Madras High Court has said that the use of digital media "to vent ire" against constitutional functionaries and senior officers of the state and centre government "would not only be a personal attack on their privacy and prestige" but would also damage their reputation and have cascading effect on their work. "The opinion among the public about the said officials would be blown to smithereens, which would not be in the interest of the Nation," Justice M. Dhandapani said. The court at the outset noted that a decade and a half ago, it was only the print media which would disseminate news. The media was very conscious of their reporting, which resulted in the citizens being fed with good information, the court said. "But the emergence of the digital media, more especially the social media platforms, and coupled with the rights that have been vested on the citizens by the Constitution, not having been understood properly, the citizens, through the various social media platforms cause havoc to the nation and degrade the credibility and respect which the other countries around the globe have on Mother India," it added. Social Media Surveillance The court on January 29 in 2020 had directed the state Director General of Police to constitute separate, dedicated and special cell in each Station House, both at District Level as well as State Level for tracking the "unscrupulous offenders", who "post filthy and derogatory messages/videos in the social media not only against the constitutional functionaries and high officials in the State and Central Government, but also against the common man" The Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu, which had been asked to invite bids for purchase of equipment for surveillance of social media, on October 18 told the court that tenders have been received and they will be opened within a week, adding that a report regarding it will be filed before the court by next date of hearing. "The said statement is recorded and the respondents are directed to take steps for procuring the equipments upon opening of the tender and establish the Special Cells at the earliest, as the matter has been on board of this Court for more than a year and half without much progress having been made in the constitution and functioning of the Special Cells, which were directed to be constituted," said the court. The bench further said it had directed the constitution of Special Cells so that as and when complaints are received, the same could be dealt with and "the scurrilous acts" could be nipped in the bud. "This Court is not pointing out any particular instance or channel that castigates the individuals and the officials in the State and Central Government and the constitutional functionaries," it said. The court added that it could "wield its judicial power to curb the menace" and maintain the "social decorum and harmony" in the society but it is the duty of the law enforcing agencies to be more vigilant and come to the rescue of the affected persons, rather than putting it on the head of the Court to interfere in each and every single instance. "Only with that view in mind this Court had constituted the Special Cells and, therefore, the operation of the Special Cells at the earliest is of utmost importance," said the court. Seeking a comprehensive report from the DGP and for considering the report of the Electronics Corporation, the court listed the matter for hearing on November 02. The court has been passing the orders regarding constitution of special cells in a bail matter of a person, who was accused of posting "defamatory, abusive and unsubstantiated statements not only against an advocate "but also against a serving Judge of this Court and the entire Judicial system".   
Observing that despite Supreme Court guidelines, and legal and executive reforms, there is no significant improvement in the state of the under-trials, the Rajasthan High Court recently granted bail to an NDPS accused in view of his over 6 years incarceration as an under-trial. "This Court is anxious over the fact that jails debilitate the under-trial prisoners and if after the long wait, the accused is ultimately acquitted, then how would the long years spent by the under-trial in custody be restored to him/her/them...The issue of a large number of under-trial prisoners and their poor living conditions has been standing stubborn against the otherwise incandescent face of our democracy," the bench of Justice Farjand Ali remarked. Further, the bench specified the following factors while adjudicating a bail application against the backdrop of the right to a speedy trial: i) The delay should not have been a defence tactic. Who has caused the delay is also to be seen. Every delay does not necessarily prejudice the accused.  ii) The aim is not to interpret the right to a speedy trial in a manner so as to disregard the nature of offence, the gravity of punishment, the number of accused and witnesses, prevailing local conditions and other systemic delays.  iii) If there is a strong reason to believe that the accused will surely flee from justice if released on bail and it will be a hard task for the investigating agency to re-apprehend him, then the benefit of bail should not be extended in his favour.  iv) If it is shown by placing compelling material on record that the release of the accused may create a ruckus in the society or that he will create such a situation wherein the prosecution witnesses will not come forward to depose against him or that he may otherwise hamper the evidence of prosecution in any other manner, then utmost caution needs to be exercised in such cases before granting bail to the accused. The bench, however, added that the (iii) and (iv) points are to be considered only when strong and cogent evidence is placed on record or a compelling reason in support has come to light but surely not just on the basis of a simple, blanket submission made by the counsel appearing on behalf of the prosecution/complainant/victim. The Court further observed that while hearing a bail plea, if there appears the slightest possibility of acquittal of the accused based on any of the submissions made by counsel for the parties, then there is no harm in inclining towards extending the benefit of bail in favor of the accused so far as it is limited to the justifiable disposal of the bail. "...this Court is of the firm view that the accused should be released on bail if he has been incarcerated pending trial for more than a reasonable period of time unless extraordinary and overwhelming circumstances prevent the Court from doing so...It is the duty of the prosecutor as wells as of the Court to ensure that the prosecution evidence is produced within a reasonable period which must not be an unfair and unjust. In order to justify period of incarceration pending trial, the aid of provision for setting off period of incarceration suffered pending trial with the term of imprisonment decided by the convicting Court in the order of sentence cannot be taken in cases where the trial went on for a long period of time and ultimately resulted into acquittal," remarked the Court. In a detailed judgment outlining the fundamental right of the accused to a speedy trial and discussing its evolution, the bench referred to an array of Apex Court judgments to observe that an under-trial prisoner cannot be made to wait for the conclusion of the trial for an indefinite period as pre-conviction detention is punitive in nature to a certain extent and goes against the settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.  The Court also took into account the pitiable state of the prisons in the Country as it noted that prisoners in India sleep in turns as there is no space for all of them to sleep at the same time.  "They are packed like sardines in the cells and are deprived of basic needs like balanced diet, sanitation, sewage, hygiene etc. From food and ration to commodities like soap, detergent, toothpaste etc., everything is provided by the state in measured quantities for the number of prisoners that the prison is designated to hold and not for the number of prisoners that it actually holds in reality. In such cases, an under-trial prisoner cannot be subjected to such harsh and inhuman conditions for eons," the Court sternly observed. Further, the Court also opined that it is high time that the judicial system works on the lacuna of implementation and ensures that a trial is concluded as expeditiously as possible. The Court also said that the State should maintain a computerized record of all the prisoners and use tools that would indicate the names of the prisoners who have become eligible for release under Section 436A and the names of the prisoners who have otherwise spent a long duration awaiting trial from the database.  The Court also suggested that there should be a reservoir of police officials as well as legal-aid lawyers in the State to secure the presence of an undertrial prisoner before the lower court timely and to see that no prisoner awaiting trial is made to stay in the prisons longer than necessary. Significantly, the Court also said that the lawyers should take up such cases pro bono every now and then as so many of the prisoners awaiting trial in the prisons are poor, illiterate, or lacking proper primary and secondary education and are unable to chart out their legal course of action.  Regarding the case of the petitioner, the Court, while considering the above observations, especially the right to the speedy trial being a fundamental right, the over-crowdedness, and a skewed prison-prisoner ratio, the rightful object of detaining an arrestee and being cognizant of the rigor of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, and in light of the guiding pronouncements of the Apex Court on this issue, though it just and proper to enlarge the petitioner on bail.

A Division Bench of the Supreme Court of India on Monday dismissed the challenge against a decision of the Allahabad High Court to disqualify Rampur MLA Mohd. Abdullah Azam Khan for not having attained the age of 25 years on the date of the election as prescribed in Article 173(b) of the Constitution. In 2019, the Allahabad High Court struck a major blow to Khan's electoral aspirations when the petitioner, one Nawab Kazam Ali Khan, moved the Court claiming that the young politician from the Samajwadi Party had falsely represented himself to be older for the purpose of contesting the assembly elections. The Bench, comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and B.V. Nagarathna, dismissed the appeal, with Justice B.V. Nagarathna delivering a separate but concurring judgement.  The appellant was represented by Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, who argued at great length about the failure of the High Court to take into account "basic principles of the law of evidence". The crux of his contention was that the appellant had satisfactorily established the factum of his birth by placing reliance on hospital records and corroborating such records with primary and documentary evidence in terms of Sections 60 and 61 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. On the other hand, the petitioner, Sibal submitted, had not successfully discharged his burden of rejecting or displacing this evidence because he had relied only on the date provided in a school register, unsupported by either primary or documentary evidence.   Per contra, Advocate Aadil Singh Boparai, appearing on behalf of the petitioner (respondent in this appeal), contended that he had successfully discharged the initial burden placed on him, and hence, the onus has shifted onto the opposite party. He took the Court through transcripts from the cross-examination of key witnesses and strenuously argued that even if the evidence adduced by the appellant to repel the allegation against Khan was considered relevant under Section 35, such evidence did not inspire confidence and would not justify setting aside the order of the High Court.  The contentions made on behalf of the disqualified legislator did not find favour with the Bench. In the course of the hearings, Justice Nagarathna, while expressing her reservations, had said, "Abdullah Azam Khan was born only once. He cannot have two dates of birth. We will have to record a finding as to the correct date of birth." Ultimately, the Bench ruled against the appellant and upheld his disqualification.  The appellant, Mohd. Abdullah Azam Khan is the son of senior Samajwadi Party leader and Member of Parliament (Rampur) Azam Khan. Khan had contested the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections from Swar constituency in Rampur on a Samajwadi Party ticket and won. However, in December 2019, a single-Judge Bench of the Allahabad High Court invalidated his membership of the State Legislature on the ground that he was below 25 years of age at the time of filing the nomination, on the date of scrutiny of the nomination paper, and on the date of declaration of results. Holding that Khan was not qualified to be chosen to fill the seat in the legislature of the State in terms of Article 173(b) of the Constitution, Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani allowed the election petition.   Khan, along with his father, Azam Khan, and his mother, Tazeen Fatma, were also arrested in February 2020 on several charges, including cheating, for allegedly fabricating his birth certificate. In December of the same year, Fatma obtained bail. However, it was not until January 2022, that Khan was released from Sitapur Jail in Uttar Pradesh. His father was released later in May after 27 months of incarceration.  Case Title  Mohd. Abdullah Azam Khan v. Nawab Kazim Ali Khan [CA No. 104/2020]

While disposing of the plea seeking benefit to the petitioners, under the package for return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants, Justice Sanjeev Kumar held that, "In the absence of a specific definition of the term "Kashmiri Pandit family," the only way to find out the true meaning of the term is to apply the common parlance principle. There is no denying the fact that in common parlance, Kashmiri Pandit is a community of Kashmiri-speaking Brahmins living in the Valley for generations and are distinctly identified by their dress, customs, and traditions, etc. "Kashmiri Pandits" is a separately identifiable community distinct from other Hindus residing in the Valley like Rajputs, Brahmins other than Kashmiri Pandits, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and many others." Background In the year 2009, the Government of India issued Prime Minister's Package for return and rehabilitation to Kashmiri migrants in Kashmir Valley. The said package was later extended to non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits as well. In December 2020, the State issued an advertisement for filling up 1997 posts while carrying a recruitment drive. The advertisement was also open for the Kashmiri Pandits who had not migrated. However, these categories of people were required to produce bonafide documents certifying that such candidates had not migrated and were, accordingly, not registered with the Commissioner (Relief). The Deputy Commissioners were also to certify that the candidates, seeking the benefit of special recruitment drive carried under Prime Minister's package, belonged to the community described as "Kashmiri Pandits."  The Deputy Commissioners chose not to grant such certificates in respect of a group of non-migrant Kashmiri Hindus, on the analogy that they did not belong to the community of "Kashmiri Pandits." After that, the present petition was filed, and by way of an interim measure, the Court allowed them to participate in the selection process. The petitioner now contends that the selection process has been almost concluded and the selection list framed. However, the respondents have withheld the selection of the petitioners on the ground that they do not meet the requirement of production of the "Kashmiri Pandit" certificate issued by the competent authority. Advocate Altaf Mehraj, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the benefit of the Prime Minister's Package cannot be restricted to only one community, i.e., "Kashmiri Pandits," and ignoring other Hindu castes, communities,, and clans who have similarly suffered due to the onslaught in 1990. It was submitted that all Hindus residing in the Valley and have not migrated constitute one class. Their further classification based on their identities is not permissible in law. It is alleged that the State has refused to issue certificates in bonafide cases in favor of candidates who are similarly situated with the petitioners and carry the surname of "Singh." It is further argued that the term "Kashmiri Pandits" is wide enough to include all non-migrant castes and communities of Hindus residing in the Valley and have similarly suffered as non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits.  Assistant Solicitor General of India, T.M. Shamsi, along with Government Advocates Usmani Gani and Sajad Ashraf, opposed the petition by submitting that various posts were created for Kashmiri migrants on a supernumerary basis across various departments. In terms of Rule 2 of the Jammu & Kashmir Migrants (Special Drive) Recruitment Rules, 2009, entitling the following category of people as eligible for the said posts: (i) a person who has migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November, 1989 and is registered as such with the Relief Commissioner;  (ii) a person who has migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November, 1989, but has not been so registered with the Relief Commissioner on the ground of his being in service of Government in any moving officer or having left the Valley or any other part of the State in pursuit of occupation or vocation or otherwise and is possessed of immovable property at the place from where he has migrated but is unable to ordinarily reside there due to the disturbed conditions;  (iii) an internally displaced person who has migrated within Valley from his original place of residence in Kashmir Valley for security reasons and is registered as such with the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner, Migrants; and  (iv) a person who belongs to the Kashmiri Pandit Family and has not migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November 1989 and is presently residing in the Kashmir Valley. Referring to the said classification, it was submitted that category (i), (ii), and (iii), the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner for Migrants is the designated authority for authentication of the migrant status of the applicants. He has to ensure that the applicant is a bonafide migrant. At the same time, as for the category of persons mentioned at (iv) above, the Deputy Commissioner concerned is the designated authority for authentication of the applicant's status through the issue of the certificate. It was argued that there was no separate quota within the quota available for any migrant or non-migrant community regarding these posts. It is, thus, submitted that in the absence of challenge to the Recruitment Rules of 2009 by the petitioners, the full effect to the rules is required to be given. Justifying the rejection, they argued that the petitioners who are neither migrants falling in categories (i), (ii), and (iii) nor do they belong to the Kashmiri Pandit family are not eligible to participate in the selection process. The respondents also brought attention to a 2019 judgment of the Jammu & Kashmir High Court, where the Sikh community living in the Valley approached, submitting that they have similarly suffered like non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits were entitled to have the benefit of Prime Minister's Special Package. They claimed to be considered for 500 posts earmarked for non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits residing in Kashmir Valley. However, the Court has not found a non-migrant Sikh community, which too had stayed back in the Valley and had not migrated during 1990 like the non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits, similarly situated and on par with non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits. Findings The Court held that the issue raised by the petitioners is no longer res Integra referring to Kashmiri Sikh Community and Ors. v. State of J&K and Ors. (2019). It remarked,  "The parity sought by the Sikhs residing in the Valley who had not migrated in the wake of 1990 turmoil, with the non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits for the purposes of implementation of Prime Minister's Special Package of employment and rehabilitation has not been accepted by this Court, and the classification made by SRO 425 of 2017 has been held to be valid, there is hardly any scope for the petitioners to raise the similar contention yet again." The Court observed that the argument raised is preposterous and cannot be accepted in the face of the clear language of the relevant rule. It needs to be noticed that the petitioners have not challenged SRO 425, whereby the Rules of 2009 have been amended to provide the category of non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits for admitting them to the benefit of a revised package of Prime Minister for employment and rehabilitation. The Court noted that in the absence of such challenge, the only question that remains to be determined in this petition is whether the petitioners, who are, admittedly, not Kashmiri Pandits but belong to different castes of Hindus, can be brought within the definition of "Kashmiri Pandits." Refusing to accept the broad definition proposed by the petitioners, the Court noted that in Rule 2(ca) is the term 'Kashmiri Pandit' means a person belonging to 'Kashmiri Pandit Family' who has not migrated from Kashmir Valley after 1st of November, 1989 and is presently residing in Kashmir Valley.  Applying the common parlance principle, the Court defined Kashmiri Pandit as members of a Kashmiri community speaking Brahmins living in the Valley from generations and are distinctly identified by their dress, customs, traditions, etc. It was held to be a separately identifiable community distinct from other Hindus residing in the Valley like Rajputs, Brahmins other than Kashmiri Pandits, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,, and many others. "It is, thus, difficult to accept the contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners, who are mostly Kshatriyas, Rajputs, Scheduled Caste non- Kashmiri Brahmins, etc. should be treated as Kashmiri," the Court added.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has quashed a demand by the GST Department against Genpact India and held that subcontracting for a service is not an "intermediary" service. The division bench of Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Deepak Manchanda has noted that Genpact India provides the main service directly to the overseas clients of Genpact International (GI) but does not get any remuneration from such clients. It is GI that gets paid by its customers, to whom the services are being provided directly by the petitioner. Nothing has been brought to light to show that the petitioner has a direct contract with the customers of GI. The petitioner/assessee, Genpact India, is registered with the Haryana GST Authorities and is involved in providing a host of services collectively referred to as BPO services to customers located in India as well as outside India. The petitioner entered into a Master Services Sub-Contracting Agreement (MSA) with GI, an entity located outside India. As per the terms of the MSA, various services are to be provided by the petitioner on a principal-to-principal basis. The petitioner is engaged by GI for the actual performance of BPO services for the clients of GI located outside India. The arrangement requires the petitioner to complete and submit the assigned processes and scope of work directly to third parties located outside India. The petitioner filed an application with the Haryana GST authorities, claiming a refund of unutilized ITC on account of zero-rated supplies of services without payment of IGST under the Letter of Undertaking. The Additional Commissioner CGST (Appeals) has held that the services provided by the petitioner are in the nature of "intermediary services" and do not qualify as "export of services." The Additional Commissioner CGST (Appeals) rejected the refund claim of unutilized Input Tax Credit (ITC) used in making zero-rated supplies of services without payment of Integrated Goods and Service Tax. The petitioner contended that as per the definition of "intermediary" under Section 2 (13) of the IGST Act, a person who provides services "on his own account" is not an "intermediary." The provider of the main service is clearly excluded from the definition of "intermediary." No evidence is on record to establish that the petitioner had not provided the main service. There was no mention of a third party that the petitioner had "arranged" and who had then provided the main services. The petitioner is rendering services "on its own account" and is not facilitating any supply of services between GI and its customers. The petitioner is responsible for providing all services as well as all risks associated with their performance and pricing. The department contended that the petitioner is acting on behalf of GI and supplying support services so that GI can supply main services in the nature of business process outsourcing, information technology services, managing relationships with customers, negotiating customer agreements and statements of work, and customer invoicing and collection to its customers. The court, while allowing the petition, held that the petitioner is providing the services that have been subcontracted to it by GI. It receives fees and charges from the main contractor, GI, for its services as a subcontractor. The main contractor, i.e., GI, in turn, is receiving commissions from its clients for the main services that are rendered by the petitioner pursuant to the arrangement of subcontracting.

The Supreme Court observed that the wilful breach of the undertaking given to the Court can amount to Contempt under Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act. An undertaking given by a party should be seen in the context in which it was made and (i) the benefits that accrued to the undertaking party; and (ii) the detriment/injury suffered by the counter party, the bench comprising... The Supreme Court observed that the wilful breach of the undertaking given to the Court can amount to Contempt under Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act.  An undertaking given by a party should be seen in the context in which it was made and (i) the benefits that accrued to the undertaking party; and (ii) the detriment/injury suffered by the counter party, the bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian observed. The bench, however, expressed its doubt about the observation made in an earlier judgment that there is no distinction between wilful violation of the terms of a consent decree and wilful violation of a decree passed on adjudication.  In this case, the Delhi High Court had held a husband and wife guilty of committing contempt of Court and sentenced them to simple imprisonment for three months along with a fine of Rs.2000. The proceedings were initiated by the Court in view of breach of an undertaking given by them to Court,while obtaining conditional order of stay. Their contentions before the Apex Court in appeal were: (i) that the failure of a party to comply with an undertaking, on the basis of which a conditional order of stay was granted, cannot be treated as a wilful disobedience warranting the invocation of the contempt jurisdiction; (ii) that the failure of the petitioners to honour the undertaking cannot be taken to substantially interfere with the due course of justice and, hence, the case would fall under Section 13(a) of the Act; (iii) that when an order indicates the consequences of the failure of a party to comply with a condition or honour the undertaking, the invocation of the contempt jurisdiction may not be appropriate; and (iv) that in any case if the defaulting party has relied upon an interpretation of the order that the consequences of failure are already inbuilt in the order, such an understanding of the order is to be treated as reasonable and rational and he cannot be held guilty of contempt "16. It is true that this Court has held in a series of decisions that the wilful breach of the undertaking given to the Court amounts to contempt of Court under Section 2(b) of the Act. But the Court has always seen (i) the nature of the undertaking made; (ii) the benefit if any, reaped by the party giving the undertaking; and (iii) whether the filing of the undertaking was with a view to play fraud upon the court or to hoodwink the opposite party." Doubts Rama Narang Judgment The court noted that in Babu Ram Gupta vs. Sudhir Bhasin, the court had noted the distinction between an order passed on consent terms and an order passed solely on the basis of an undertaking given to court and the distinction between a person playing fraud on the court thereby obstructing the course of justice and a person playing fraud on one of the parties. Referring to another judgment in Rama Narang vs. Ramesh Narang  the court observed: "In Rama Narang (supra), this Court pointed out the distinction between two categories of cases covered by Section 2(b) of the Act namely (i) wilful disobedience to a process of court; and (ii) wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court...This Court went to the extent of holding that it would neither be in consonance with the statute, judicial authority, principle or logic to draw any distinction between the wilful violation of the terms of a consent decree and wilful violation of a decree passed on adjudication. We have our own doubts whether the first category of cases covered by Section 2(b) can be stretched so far. Anyway, that question does not arise in this case and hence we leave it at that.", the bench said. An act of contempt cannot simply be based upon the subsequent conduct The bench further observed that an undertaking given by a party should be seen in the context in which it was made and (i) the benefits that accrued to the undertaking party; and (ii) the detriment/injury suffered by the counter party.  "It is also true that normally the question whether a party is guilty of contempt is to be seen in the specific context of the disobedience and the wilful nature of the same and not on the basis of the conduct subsequent thereto. While it is open to the court to see whether the subsequent conduct of the alleged contemnor would tantamount to an aggravation of the contempt already committed, the very determination of an act of contempt cannot simply be based upon the subsequent conduct.. But the subsequent conduct of the party may throw light upon one important aspect namely whether it was just the inability of the party to honour the commitment or it was part of a larger design to hoodwink the court.", it added. Taking note of the facts of the case, the bench observed that it is unable to find fault with the High Court holding the petitioners guilty of contempt. The court therefore upheld the finding of guilt, but ordered reduction of the period of sentence from three months to the period of imprisonment already suffered/undergone.       
The Supreme Court observed that any default or delay in the payment of EPF contribution by the employer is a sine qua non for imposition of levy of damages under Section 14B of the Employees Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.The bench comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S.

The Supreme Court observed that any default or delay in the payment of EPF contribution by the employer is a sine qua non for imposition of levy of damages under Section 14B of the Employees Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The bench comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed that mens rea or actus reus is not an essential element for imposing penalty/damages for breach of civil obligations/liabilities. In this case, the Karnataka High Court held that once the employer has failed to deposit the contribution of EPF or committed default as mandated under the provisions of thehaving failed to do so after determination under Section 7A by the competent authority, levy of damages is a sine qua non. The High Court upheld the order for recovery of damages in the proceedings initiated under Section 14B of the Act 1952. Before the Apex Court, the appellant contended that the element of mens rea or actus reus is one of the essential elements which has not been taken note of by the authority while imposing damages under Section 14B of the Act 1952. The respondents, on the other hand, contended that mens rea is not an essential element for imposing penalty for breach of civil obligations or liabilities So the issue considered was whether the breach of civil obligations or liabilities committed by the employer is a sine qua non for imposition of penalty/damages or the element of mens rea or actus reus is one of the essential elements has a role to play and the authority is under an obligation to examine the justification, if any, being tendered while passing the order imposing damages under the provisions of the Act 1952. it is well settled that mens rea or actus reus is not an essential element for imposing penalty or damages for breach of civil obligations and liabilities, the bench said while referring to various earlier judgments. The court noted that the three judges bench in Union of India v. Dharmendra Textile Processors and others (2008) 13 SCC 369 while examining the scope and ambit of Section 271(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 held that as far as the penalty inflicted under the provisions is a civil liability is concerned, mens rea or actus reus is not an essential element for imposing civil penalties and overruled the two-Judge Bench judgment in Dilip N. Shroff v. Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai and Another (2007) 6 SCC 329. Therefore, while dismissing the appeal, the bench observed: "Taking note of three-Judge Bench judgment of this Court in Union of India and Others v. Dharmendra Textile Processors and others (supra), which is indeed binding on us, we are of the considered view that any default or delay in the payment of EPF contribution by the employer under the Act is a sine qua non for imposition of levy of damages under Section 14B of the Act 1952  and mens rea or actus reus is not an essential element for imposing penalty/damages for breach of civil obligations/liabilities" Head notes Employees Provident Fund And Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 - Section 14B - Any default or delay in the payment of EPF contribution by the employer under the Act is a sine qua non for imposition of levy of damages under Section 14B - Mens rea or actus reus is not an essential element for imposing penalty/damages for breach of civil obligations/liabilities.

The 'Skin-to-skin' judgement passed by the Supreme Court yesterday had set aside impugned judgements of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench). A three-judge Bench of Justices U.U.Lalit, S.Ravindra Bhat and Bela.M.Trivedi has held that 'skin-to-skin' touch is not a requirement to constitute an offence of sexual assault under S.7 of the POCSO Act.

A three-judge Bench of Justices U.U.Lalit, S.Ravindra Bhat and Bela.M.Trivedi has held that 'skin-to-skin' touch is not a requirement to constitute an offence of sexual assault under S.7 of the POCSO Act.  The majority opinion, authored by Justice Bela Trivedi, makes a crucial observation about the manner in which certified copies of judgement be uploaded. The judgement expresses its surprise that the Registry of High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, has certified the copy of the impugned judgment by affixing the stamp on the back side of every page of the judgment which is blank. It further notes that the said copy of the judgment appears to have been downloaded from the website and, therefore, does not bear even the  signature or the name of the concerned judge at the end of the judgment. It further notes that while it is a written statement at the foot of the judgement that the said copy is a true copy of the judgment as contemplated in Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act is also missing.   Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that in case of certified copies of public documents the public officer having the custody of the public document shall provide a certificate written at the foot of such copy that it is a true copy of such document or part thereof.   The judgement further makes notes of the perils of not following the stipulation of Section 76:   "Such a practice, if followed by the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court, may allow the miscreants to manipulate or commit mischief in the judicial orders which are used as the public documents having great significance in the judicial proceedings."  The judgment has directed the Registrar General of the Bombay High Court, to look into the matter and ensure that proper procedure for preparing the certified copies of the judgments/orders of the Court in accordance with law is followed.  "It is very surprising to note that the Registry of High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, has certified the copy of the impugned judgment by affixing the stamp on the back side of every page of the judgment which is blank. The said copy of the judgment appears to have been downloaded from the website and, therefore, does not bear even the signature or the name of the concerned judge at the end of the judgment. The certificate that the said copy is a true copy of the judgment, is also not written at the foot of the judgment as contemplated in Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act. Such a practice, if followed by the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court, may allow the miscreants to manipulate or commit mischief in the judicial orders which are used as the public documents having great significance in the judicial proceedings. The Registrar General of the Bombay High Court, therefore, is directed to look into the matter and ensure that proper procedure for preparing the certified copies of the judgments/orders of the Court in accordance with law is followed"  Interestingly, in 2016 a Single judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in M/S.Spectrum Power Generation vs Mr.M.Kishna Rao had refused to interfere with the decision of the trial court raising an objection over the certified copies issued by the High Court which did not contain the certification as required by Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Further, it held that the copy of the order passed by the High Court containing no seal or certification as duly required by Section 76 of the Act cannot be called a certified copy.   It had observed:  "Unless there is a seal or certification as duly required under Section 76 of the Act, when it is not called a certified copy and even the High Court Rules in no way exempt from application of the said Section for the High Court to issue a certified copy, it is the duty of the registry of the High Court to take care in certifying in compliance with Section 76 of the Act. Thus, to the extent of return of the memo by the trial court to receive the documents as not duly certified as contemplated by Section 76 of the Act, there is nothing to interfere."

The Allahabad High Court last week directed the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Bahraich to take requisite steps to provide compensation to a 12-year-old Rape survivor whose unwanted pregnancy was terminated earlier this month as per HC's order. The bench of Justice Attau Rahman Masoodi and Justice Om Prakash Shukla has further asked the Secretary, DLSA to take up the matter with the district authorities and submit a report to the Senior Registrar of thE Court as to the outcome of such efforts taken for the payment of compensation to the victim or her family as per the prevailing scheme i.e. U.P. Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014. The Court was essentially dealing with the case of the 12-year-old Girl who was raped in April 2022, however, due to fear, she didn't disclose anything about the incident to anyone. Thereafter, in August 2022, she finally narrated the entire story to her parents and thus, an FIR was lodged and the accused was arrested. Thereafter, she moved a representation before the concerned authorities of her home district (Bahraich), however, no substantial action was taken and thus, the father of the victim moved to the High Court with the instant writ plea seeking the termination of her unwanted pregnancy.  The Allahabad High Court on September 13, allowed the Writ Petition that was filed before it to terminate the 24-week-old pregnancy of a 12-year-old rape survivor. Keeping in view the report of the medical board, the bench of Justice Attau Rahman Masoodi and Justice Om Prakash Shukla permitted the medical experts to proceed with the challenge of terminating the pregnancy in the interest of justice. After the termination of her pregnancy, the victim was discharged from the Hospital and she is currently under the guardianship of her natural parents. Now, on September 20, the Counsel of the victim's father pressed the prayer for rehabilitation of the victim.  It was submitted that the government has also evolved a scheme whereunder the victims of rape have been provided financial support so that they lead a normal life like ordinary citizens. It was informed that the victim is going through a vulnerable situation and is dependent on all sorts of help including legal services to claim the benefit of the scheme applicable in this behalf. In view of this, the Court disposed of the plea by issuing the following direction: "Accordingly, we hereby direct the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Bahraich to ensure all the necessary legal assistance and help to the victim and ensure that the claim for compensation as per the prevailing scheme i.e. U.P. Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014 as amended from time to time is provided to the petitioner without any delay. All the requisite steps for the payment of compensation shall be taken by the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Bahraich expeditiously." Case title - Ms. X Thru.

The Supreme Court observed that High Courts should refrain from excercising writ jurisdiction there is an alternate remedy available. When there is an alternate remedy available, judicial prudence demands that the court refrains from exercising its jurisdiction under constitutional provisions, the bench of Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed. The bench observed thus while allowing an appeal filed against a judgment of High Court which allowed a writ petition filed against an order passed by Assessing Officer determining the tax liability along with interest and penalty under Maharashtra Value Added Tax, 2002 and Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. Advocate Sachin Patil, for the appellants,  contended that against the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer under the provisions of the MVAT Act and CST Act, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The assessee had a statutory alternative remedy available by way of appeal before the first appellate authority and the said remedy ought to have been pursued, it was urged. Senior Advocate Rafique Dada justified the impugned judgment contending that for an earlier assessment order, there was a decision against the assessee by the first appellate authority on merits and therefore it may be a formality to prefer an appeal before the first appellate authority and hence the writ petitioner rightly filed the writ petition before the High Court. The bench observed that the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the assessment order in view of the availability of statutory remedy under the Act. The bench said: "It is required to be noted that against the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer under the provisions of the MVAT Act and CST Act, the assessee straightway preferred writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It is not in dispute that the statutes provide for the right of appeal against the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer and against the order passed by the first appellate authority, an appeal/revision before the Tribunal. In that view of the matter, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the assessment order in view of the availability of statutory remedy under the Act." The court observed that the question is not about the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, but about the entertainability of the writ petition against the order of assessment by-passing the statutory remedy of appeal.

The NCB had arrested the trio on October 3 following a raid at the international cruise terminal the previous day. They had moved the High Court after rejection of bail by the Special NDPS Court, on October 20.  NCB has alleged that the accused are part of a larger conspiracy, Khan has international links and thus required for further interrogation to unearth the truth.  The agency further alleged that Khan is an influential person and attempts have already been made to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence.  Meanwhile, Khan, represented by Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, that his arrest was made in sheer violation of Article 22 of the Constitution, inasmuch as he was not informed about the correct grounds for arrest.  He also denied allegations of "conscious possession" of contraband which was recovered from his friend Arbaaz (6gms charas). Read Khan's arguments here. Read NCB's arguments here.

The Delhi High Court has held that the reassessment notice based on an error resulting from the oversight of the assessing officer is not valid. The division bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice Amit Mahajan has relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Gemini Leather Stores v. Income Tax Officer, in which it was held that where the Income Tax Officer has all the material before him and has framed the original assessment, it is not open for him to take recourse to Section 147(a) of the Act to remedy the error resulting from his oversight. The court has observed that it was impermissible for the AO to seek a reopening of the assessment to review its decision regarding the fair market value of the property or deduction on account paid by the assessee to his sisters or the expenses incurred by him. The petitioner/assessee has assailed a notice under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The assessee was issued the notice to file a return of income on the grounds that his income chargeable to tax for the assessment year 2016-17 had escaped assessment under Section 147. The Assessing Officer believed that a part of the assessee's income, by way of capital gains resulting from the sale of the property at Vasant Vihar, had escaped assessment. The assessee contended that his return of income duly disclosed the transaction regarding the sale of property and the computation of capital gains resulting from the said transaction. The assessee's return was picked up for scrutiny, and his income was assessed under Section 143(3) of the Act. The AO did not accept the assessee's computation and recomputed the capital gains. The assessee claimed that the notice, in effect, seeks to re-examine the assessment, which is impermissible. The issue raised was whether the issue of the reassessment notice, occasioned by a possible change of opinion and seeking to review the assessment order, was valid. The assessee contended that the reopening of the assessment was not permissible merely on the ground of a change of opinion. The department claimed that the notice to seek reassessment was issued in response to audit objections. It constitutes tangible material on the basis of which assessments can be reopened. The court has allowed the petition and quashed the reassessment notice.

While upholding the detention of an alleged worker of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), under the J&K Public Safety Act, 1978, the Jammu & Kashmir And Ladakh High Court last week observed that those who are responsible for national security or for maintenance of public order must be the sole judges of what the national security, public order or security of the State requires.Observing that it... While upholding the detention of an alleged worker of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), under the J&K Public Safety Act, 1978, the Jammu & Kashmir And Ladakh High Court last week observed that those who are responsible for national security or for maintenance of public order must be the sole judges of what the national security, public order or security of the State requires. Observing that it is necessary to take preventive measures and prevent a person bent upon perpetrating mischief from translating his ideas into action, the Bench of Justice Tashi Rabstan stressed that preventive detention laws are devised to afford protection to society. Further, noting that the basis of detention is the satisfaction of the executive of a reasonable probability of likelihood of detenu acting in a manner similar to his past acts and preventing him by detention from doing the same, the court significantly observed thus: "There is no reason why the Executive cannot take recourse to its power of preventive detention in those cases where the Court is genuinely satisfied that no prosecution could possibly succeed against detenu because he is a dangerous person who has overawed witnesses or against whom no one is prepared to depose," the Court further remarked. The Court also stressed that the acts or activities of individual or a group of individuals, prejudicial to the security of the State or public order, have the magnitude of across-the board disfigurement of societies and therefore, no court should tune out such activities, being swayed by the passion of mercy.  "It is an obligation of the Court to constantly remind itself the right of society is never maltreated or marginalized by doings, an individual or set of individuals propagate and carry out...The court do not even go into the questions whether the facts mentioned in the grounds of detention are correct or false. The reason for the rule is that to decide this, evidence may have to be taken by the courts and that it is not the policy of the law of preventive detention. This matter lies within the competence of the advisory board," the Court added. Regarding, the Court's power to examine the material, which is made the basis of subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, the Court opined that it would not act as a court of appeal and find fault with the satisfaction on the ground that on the basis of the material before detaining authority another view was possible. Importantly, referring to Ashok Kumar v. Delhi Administration and others AIR 1982 SC 1143, the Court said that any preventive measures, even if they involve some restraint or hardship upon individuals, do not partake in any way of the nature of punishment. Further, the Court also noted that where individual liberty comes into conflict with an interest of the security of the State or maintenance of public order, then the liberty of the individual must give way to the larger interest of the nation. Lastly, opining that the petition was shorn of any merit, the Court, while dismissing the plea filed by Muntazir Ahmad Bhat, an alleged worker of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), observed that Preventive detention is devised to afford protection to society and the object is not to punish a man for having done something but to intercept before he does it, and to prevent him from doing so.

The Delhi High Court has permanently restrained a total of 732 rogue websites from broadcasting and streaming the Ajay Devgn starrer movie "Bhuj: The Pride of India." Directed by Bhuj Abhishek Dudhaiya, the film was released on August 13 last year. The movie relates to the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and has now been released on various online and OTT platforms.  Justice Pratibha M Singh decreed a suit filed last year by Star India Private Limited and Novi Digital Entertainment Private Limited against 42 rogue websites seeking that the websites be restrained permanently from communicating the film to the public.  On August 9 last year, the court had passed an order of interim injunction against the 42 rogue websites as set out in the plaint, restraining them from broadcasting the movie. However, despite the interim order, the court was apprised that additional URLs and domain names were also illegally streaming the film. In this regard, the plaintiffs then filed affidavits bringing on record various other domain names and websites.  Noting that the movie has already been released on various platforms including the OTT platforms and other online platforms, the court ordered: "In view thereof, since the rights of the Plaintiffs are not in question, a permanent injunction is liable to be granted in terms of paragraph 66(i) of the plaint against all the rogue websites i.e., Defendant Nos. 1 to 42 and the other domain names added by subsequent affidavits totalling 689 additional websites/ domain names." The court also directed the domain name registrars to ensure that the impugned domain names are suspended, locked and status quo is maintained in respect of the same.  "The same shall not be permitted to be transferred to any third party. The orders of blocking shall also stand confirmed permanently in respect of all the impugned domain names / websites," the court added.  Title: STAR INDIA PVT LTD & ANR. v. MOVIESGHAR.ART & ORS.    
The Madras High Court has recently reiterated that fraudulent or illegal encroachment of temple properties is a crime against society at large. The Court was adjudicating upon eviction proceedings against a man who had claimed to be the leaseholder of certain temple property belonging to the Arulmigu Agatheeswara Swamy Thirukkoil, Chennai. Justice SM Subramaniam observed,"Fraudulent... The Madras High Court has recently reiterated that fraudulent or illegal encroachment of temple properties is a crime against society at large. The Court was adjudicating upon eviction proceedings against a man who had claimed to be the leaseholder of certain temple property belonging to the Arulmigu Agatheeswara Swamy Thirukkoil, Chennai.  Justice SM Subramaniam observed, "Fraudulent and illegal encroachments of temple properties is a crime against the society at large. Misappropriation of the funds of the temple is undoubtedly an offence and all such offences are to be registered and the offenders are liable to be prosecuted by the State as the State is the controller of these temples and the offences are also committed against the State. Temple properties are allowed to be looted by few greedy men and by few professional criminals and land grabbers. Active or passive contribution and collusion by the officials of the HR & CE Department cannot be overruled. These lapses, negligence, dereliction of duty on the part of such public officials are also to be viewed seriously and all appropriate actions in this regard are highly warranted"  Furthermore, the Court held that properties of deities, temples and Devaswom Boards must be protected by their trustees, Archaks, Sebaits and other employees. It was also noted that in many instances, people entrusted with the duty of safeguarding temple properties have misappropriated such properties by setting up false claims of ownership or tenancy, or adverse possession.  "This is possible only with the passive or active collusion of the concerned authorities. Such acts of 'fences eating the crops' should be dealt with sternly. The Government, members or trustees of Boards/Trusts, and devotees should be vigilant to prevent any such usurpation or encroachment. It is also the duty of courts to protect and safeguard the properties of religious and charitable institutions from wrongful claims or misappropriation," the Court observed.  It was further held that public rights are involved in such matters and therefore Courts must intervene and discharge its constitutional obligations.  "Beyond the private right, a public right is involved in such matters. When a public right is involved and the allegations are far more serious, then the Courts are expected to step-in and deal with such matters sternly and in an appropriate manner, failing which, the High Court is failing in its duty to exercise its Constitutional obligations", the Court opined.  In the instant case, the Court held that no documents had been produced by the petitioner to substantiate his alleged lease rights. Thus, it was concluded that the petitioner as well his family members were encroachers and illegal occupants who had misused the temple property for personal gains. The Court further expressed strong reservations against the petitioner for sub-letting a super-structure built on the temple property for various commercial purposes such as establishing shops, restrooms, godowns among others.  "It is shocking that the temple properties are dealt with by these illegal occupants in an illegal manner and the Authorities though initiated action, this Court has to record that such actions initiated are not only insufficient, but raises a doubt about the active or passive collusion on the part of such Competent Authorities of the temple," the Court stated.  The Court thus proceeded to reject the petitioner's plea against eviction proceedings and thus directed the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department to conduct an elaborate inquiry into the matter taking into consideration the long period of illegal possession of the temple property and the money appropriated by the petitioner. In case, it is found that the HR&CE authorities had also colluded in any manner, the Court ordered that action must be taken against the authorities as well.  "Active or passive collusion on the part of the Authorities in dealing with the temple properties in such a manner and initiate appropriate action against all those Authorities, who have contributed for the maladministration of the temple properties", the Court added.  It was further opined that since the 'deity' in a temple is a 'minor', the Court must protect the interests of an idol in any litigation. In the event that the trustee or the Executive Officer of the temple fails to protect the interests of the idol, the Court opined that any person interested in respect of such temple or worshiping the deity can certainly be clothed with an adhoc power of representation to protect its interest.  "Where the persons in management of a temple failed to protect the interest of the temple diligently, the Court is empowered to take notice of such facts and deal with the issues in an appropriate manner. The Court is bound to take notice of the fact that the Executive Officers appointed in the temples are being changed periodically and in many a case, they do not get fully acquainted with the history or affairs of the temple. If there is lapses, slackness or negligence on the part of the Executive Officer and the trustees of the temple, "it is the duty of the Court to ensure that the 'Deity' does not suffer thereby. The Courts should be astute to protect the interests of an idol in any litigation", the Court further observed.  Case Title: K Senthilkumar v.

The Delhi High Court has dissolved marriage between a couple living separately for 12 years taking note of the fact that the wife had filed an unsubstantiated criminal complaint against the husband and his family members which caused them immense mental cruelty and agony.Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh dissolved the marriage by decree of divorce under Sections 13(1)(ia)... The Delhi High Court has dissolved marriage between a couple living separately for 12 years taking note of the fact that the wife had filed an unsubstantiated criminal complaint against the husband and his family members which caused them immense mental cruelty and agony. Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh dissolved the marriage by decree of divorce under Sections 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Bench was of the view that there was no chance of reconciliation between the parties and that the marriage was irretrievably broken down. It also noted that no useful purpose would be served by maintaining the matrimonial bond and the insistence to continue the relationship would only be inflicting further cruelty upon both the parties. "The marital discord between the parties at present is such that there is a complete loss of faith, trust, understanding and love between the parties. The conduct of the Respondent (wife) has been such as to cause great mental anguish to the Appellant (husband), and the parties cannot be reasonably expected to live with each other anymore," the Court noted.  The Court was dealing with an appeal challenging the judgment and decree passed by the Family Court whereby the petition seeking divorce under Sections 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 filed by the appellant husband, was dismissed. The Court was of the view that the conduct of the appellant showed that, at least, till the time he filed the petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, he wanted to make the marriage work. However, it noted that the wife did not resume cohabitation or join husband in the matrimonial relationship.  "Rather, the respondent filed a complaint before the CAW cell alleging dowry demand, threat to life, and harassment at the hands of the appellant and his family members. The same allegations were reiterated in the reply to the section 9 petition, where the CAW cell complaint was also annexed. The respondent prayed for dismissal of the petition under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955," the Court noted.  The Court said that the conduct of the wife not only demonstrated a clear intention on her part to desert the husband, but also her lack of sensitivity to the physical and emotional needs of the husband.  The Court said "After nearly two years of leaving the matrimonial home, and three years of the marriage, the respondent filed a complaint on 10.10.2011 before the CAW Cell, Krishna Nagar, Delhi against the Appellant and his family members, alleging dowry demands, abuse, physical and mental torture and harassment, amongst other cruelties. These allegations remained unsubstantiated." The Court was of the view that the allegations were not established and the same amount to a clear and categorical character assassination of the husband as well as his family members.  Observing that the Family Court ignored the said aspect of the matter, the Court said: "Moreover, the appellant had to make 30-40 visits to the police station in connection with the said complaint. A police station is not the best of places for anyone to visit. It must have caused mental harassment and trauma each time he was required to visit the police station, with the Damocles Sword hanging over his head, and he not knowing when a case would be registered against him and he would be arrested. So far as the respondent is concerned, she had done everything to get the appellant and his family entrapped in the criminal case. That was also her prayer in her complaint." Furthermore, the Court also said that the wife could not justify not returning to the matrimonial home, and her refusal to cohabitate with the husband was sufficient to establish desertion by her. "In this view of the matter, we are of the view that the appellant has been able to make out a case of being subjected to cruelty and desertion at the hands of the respondent. We are unable to agree with the findings of the Family Court. That the appellant is entitled to succeed on both the grounds i.e. Sections 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(ib)," the Court held.  Accordingly, the plea was disposed of. Advocates Sumeet Verma and Mahinder Pratap Singh appeared for the appellant whereas Advocate Pratyush Chirantam appeared for the respondent. Title: X v. Y      
The Supreme Court has modified the slew of directions relating to advance medical directives, or living wills issued in a 2018 judgement that had recognised the right to die with dignity as an inextricable facet of the right to live with dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution, and had, accordingly, upheld the legal validity of passive euthanasia.  The modification order was passed by a Constitution Bench comprising Justices K.M. Joseph, Ajay Rastogi, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy, and C.T. Ravikumar that was considering an application by the Indian Council for Critical Care Medicine. The order dictated by the bench on January 24 was uploaded recently. Arguing that the directions had become virtually unenforceable owing to the complexity of the procedure prescribed by the top court, the non-profit association of Indian physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, and other allied healthcare professionals involved in the care of the critically ill sought necessary amendments to make the judgement ‘workable’. Accordingly, several changes were introduced by the five-judge bench in the guidelines laid down in 2018 with respect to the execution and enforcement of advance care directives, as well as the procedure for passive euthanasia.  What is an advance medical directive?  Advance directives are legal documents that extend a person’s autonomy and control over their healthcare decisions in the event they become incapacitated. These directives enable individuals to communicate preferences regarding medical treatment, end-of-life care and other aspects of care, as well as designate a surrogate decision-maker ahead of time, before being incapacitated. In simpler terms, an advance directive ensures that the wishes of the executor are honoured, even when they are incapable of making a decision or their decision-making capacity is severely impaired.  It was noted in the 2018 judgement that unlike other countries, “there was no legal framework in our country as regards the advance medical directives”. However, the bench headed by the then-Chief Justice Dipak Misra observed, it was the constitutional obligation of the court to protect the right of the citizens as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. It was, therefore, held, “An advance medical directive would serve as a fruitful means to facilitate the fructification of the sacrosanct right to life with dignity. The said directive, we think, will dispel many a doubt at the relevant time of need during the course of treatment of the patient. That apart, it will strengthen the mind of the treating doctors as they will be in a position to ensure, after being satisfied, that they are acting in a lawful manner.”  However, as measures of abundant caution, the court also spelled out several safeguards relating to the competence of an individual to execute an advance directive and the procedure, its contents, how it ought to be recorded and preserved, when and by whom it could be enforced, where to prefer an appeal against a hospital medical board refusing permission, and the circumstances under which an advance directive could be revoked or would be inapplicable.  What changes have been made?  The bench led by Justice K.M. Joseph in January acknowledged that the earlier order resulted in ‘insurmountable’ obstacles that prevented the directions from being implemented. For instance, the court required advanced directives to not only be executed in the presence of two attesting witnesses, preferably independent witnesses, but also countersigned by a judicial first-class magistrate. “This clause has led the very object of this Court issuing directions being impaired, if not completely defeated,” the bench noted.  Several other aspects were also highlighted in the application, in response to which the court issued a detailed order appropriately modifying the existing legal requirements for withdrawal of treatment being administered to terminally ill patients. These changes have been summarised below. Surrogate decision-maker Previous guideline : Only one guardian or close relative was to be named, who would, at the time of the execution of the advance directive, be informed by the treating physician of the nature of illness, the availability of medical care, consequences of alternative forms of treatment, and the consequences of remaining untreated. Before a final opinion was formulated by the medical board constituted by the collector, and if the executor was incapacitated, the consent of the guardian or close relative would also be taken. Current guideline : More than one guardian or close relative can be named in the document, all of whom have to be informed of the nature of illness, the availability of medical care, consequences of alternative forms of treatment, and the consequences of remaining untreated by the treating physician at the time of the execution of the directive. Before a final opinion was formulated by the secondary medical board, and if the executor was incapacitated, the consent of all the nominees will be taken. Role of judicial magistrate of first class Previous guideline : Countersign of jurisdictional judicial magistrate of first class was required. The officer was further required to record their satisfaction that the document has been executed voluntarily and without fear or favour. The judicial magistrate would also preserve a copy of the document in both paper and digital formats. Current guideline : It is sufficient for an advanced directive to be attested before a notary or a gazetted officer. The requirements for it to be countersigned or preserved by a judicial magistrate has been dispensed with. Role of district court registry Previous guideline : The judicial magistrate was required to forward a copy of the document to the registry of the jurisdictional district court, which would have to retain the document in the original format. Current guideline : This requirement has been deleted. Informing family members and family physician Previous guideline : The judicial magistrate was required to inform the immediate family members of the executor and their family physician, if any. Current guideline : The executor has to hand over a copy of the advance directive to the designated decisionmaker(s) and the family physician, if any. Informing the government Previous guideline : A copy of the advance directive had to be handed over to a competent official of the local government. The aforesaid authorities would then nominate an official as its custodian. Current Guideline : In addition to this, the executor can now also incorporate the document as a part of their digital health records, if any. Ascertaining authenticity Previous guideline : When the executor became terminally ill, with no hope of recovery, the treating physician had to execute the advance directive after ascertaining its genuineness and authenticity from the judicial magistrate. Current Guideline : When the executor becomes terminally ill, with no hope of recovery, and no longer possesses decision-making capacity, the treating physician will have to execute the advance directive after ascertaining its genuineness and authenticity with reference to the digital records of the executor, or from the custodian of the document appointed by the local government body. Preliminary opinion Previous guideline : A medical board, comprising the head of the department, and at least three experts from the fields of general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry or oncology with experience in critical care and with overall standing in the medical profession of at least twenty years, had to be constituted. This board had to form a preliminary opinion. Current Guideline : A primary medical board, consisting of the treating physician and at least two subject experts of the concerned specialty with at least five years’ experience, will be constituted. This board will form a preliminary opinion preferably within 48 hours of the case being referred to it. Final opinion Previous guideline : After receiving the hospital medical board’s approval, the treating physician or hospital had to inform the jurisdictional collector, who would then constitute another medical board comprising the chief district medical officer and three expert doctors from the fields of general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry, or oncology with experience in critical care and with overall standing in the medical profession of at least twenty years. The members of the hospital medical board would not be eligible to be a part of the medical board formed by the collector. Current guideline : After the primary medical board gives its sanction, the hospital will immediately constitute a secondary medical board comprising a registered medical practitioner nominated by the chief medical officer of the district and at least two subject experts with at least five years’ experience in the concerned speciality who were not part of the primary medical board. This board will provide its opinion preferably within 48 hours of the case being referred to it. Withdrawal of treatment Previous guideline : The decision of the medical board constituted by the collector had to be conveyed by the chairman, i.e., the chief district officer, to the judicial magistrate, who would then authorise the withdrawal of treatment after visiting the executor at the earliest and examining all aspects. Current guideline : It is sufficient for the hospital to simply convey the decision of the primary and secondary medical boards and the consent of the person or persons named in the advance directive to the judicial magistrate before giving effect to the decision to withdraw the medical treatment administered to the executor. It is no longer necessary to wait for the judicial magistrate’s authorisation. Refusal by first medical board Previous guideline : If the hospital medical board took a decision not to follow an advance directive, it had to make an application to the medical board constituted by the collector for considering and passing appropriate directions with respect to the document. Current guideline : If the primary medical board takes a decision not to follow an advance directive, the nominees of the executor can request the hospital to refer the case to the secondary medical board for consideration and for passing appropriate directions. Appeal before High Court Previous guideline : If permission to withdraw treatment being administered to the executor was denied by the medical board, it would be open to the executor, his nominee, the treating physician, or the hospital staff to file a writ petition at the jurisdictional High Court. Current guideline : If permission to withdraw treatment being administered to the executor is denied by the secondary medical board, it is open to the nominees of the executor, the treating physician, or the hospital staff to file a writ petition at the jurisdictional High Court.  Can treatment be withdrawn if no advance directive has been executed?  In its 2018 judgement, the Supreme Court also prescribed the procedure to be followed in cases where a terminally ill patient with no hope of recovery did not execute an advance directive ahead of time. “It is necessary to make it clear that there will be cases where there is no advance directive. The said class of persons cannot be alienated,” the bench noted. Thus, under such circumstances, in excess of the usual safeguards, additional requirements also have to be met. Not unlike the procedure to be followed where a terminally ill patient has executed an advance directive, necessary changes were also made to the guidelines with respect to the withdrawal of treatment in the absence of an advance medical directive. The newly prescribed procedure has been summarised below:  Before withdrawing treatment, a primary medical board would have to be constituted by the hospital on being apprised by the treating physician as to the nature of the ailment. The board would consult with the patient’s next of kin, next friend, or guardian and record the minutes of the discussion as well as their consent, if they choose to furnish it, in writing. The primary board would be required to certify the proposed course of action within 48 hours. The preliminary opinion would be examined by the secondary medical board formed by the hospital. If they agree with the primary medical board, the judicial magistrate as well as the next of kin, next friend, or guardian of the patient would be informed preferably within 48 hours of the case being referred to it. Where there is a divergence of opinion, and the secondary medical board does not approve the plan to withdraw treatment, the family members, treating physician, or hospital staff may approach the High Court. The Constitution Bench has directed the Registry to communicate the order to Registrar Generals of all the High Courts, who in turn ,should dispatch a copy to the Health Secretaries in the respective States/Union Territories for onward communication to all the Chief Medical Officers in the States/Union Territories.

The Kerala High Court recently ruled that criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act merely for passing a wrong order, without any material to demonstrate that such order was deliberately passed by him for extraneous considerations or on oblique motives. The plea filed by P.Sunil Kumar, the then Tahsildar of Udumbanchola,... The Kerala High Court recently ruled that criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act merely for passing a wrong order, without any material to demonstrate that such order was deliberately passed by him for extraneous considerations or on oblique motives.  The plea filed by P.Sunil Kumar, the then Tahsildar of Udumbanchola, seeks to quash an FIR filed against him for passing an order unfavourable to the government. The said FIR alleged that the petitioner was actuated by extraneous considerations in passing it.  The question that came up in the Court was whether a public servant, who acts as quasi judicial authority under a statute, can be held criminally liable under the Act for passing a wrong order.   Justice R. Narayana Pisharadi while allowing the petition held that dishonest intention on the part of the public servant cannot be presumed to be a reason behind passing a quasi judicial order in favour of a party. There should be satisfactory material to proceed against the officer. In fact, a bare perusal of Section 13(1)(d)(ii) reveals that a public servant can be prosecuted only if he has abused his position and obtained any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage.  However, in the present mater, there was absolutely no allegation that the petitioner deliberately committed misconduct for extraneous considerations, and no discovery of any material disclosing such act during the 6 year long investigation. On that note, it was observed that "Every error committed by a quasi judicial authority, however gross it may be, should not be attributed to improper motives."  Moreover, if the petitioner has passed a wrong order, it could be corrected by the appellate or revisional forums, rather than initiating criminal proceedings. The very purpose of providing such forums was rooted on the presupposition that people may go wrong in decision making.  Possibility for a set of facts to arrive at a different conclusion is not a ground to indict a public servant for misconduct. If this is encouraged, the officer will be in constant fear of passing an order unfavourable to the Government, and would not be able to act independently. Therefore, erroneous exercise of judicial power would not amount to criminal misconduct.  Considering the aforementioned aspects, it was held that:  "Merely because the order is wrong, it does not warrant initiation of criminal proceedings against the public servant, unless he was actuated by extraneous considerations or oblique motives. The remedy for errors committed by a quasi judicial authority is appeal or revision to the forum or authority provided under the statute for that purpose."  Therefore, even if the petitioner had passed the alleged order without perusing the previous records or properly ascertaining the factual position of the matter, his act does not attract the offence under Section 13(1)(d)(ii) of the P.C Act.  A Tahsildar While Passing Orders U/S 12 Of Kerala Land Conservancy Act Acts As A Quasi Judicial Authority  To come to this observation, the Court looked into the distinction between a quasi judicial order and an administrative or ministerial order. It was found that if a statutory authority has power to do any act which will prejudicially affect the subject, the final determination of that authority is a quasi-judicial act.   Moreover, the following was observed,   "When the law requires that an authority before arriving at decision must make an enquiry, such a requirement of law makes the authority a quasi judicial authority. Another test which distinguishes administrative function from quasi judicial function is, the authority who acts quasi judicially is required to act according to the rules, whereas the authority which acts administratively is dictated by the policy and expediency."  Under the said Act, an enquiry is contemplated before passing an order. The Tahsildar has to act judicially in taking a decision in the matter before him. Therefore, the petitioner is a quasi-judicial authority in the present case.   F.I.R Must Disclose Commission Of A Cognizable Offence Before Commencement Of Investigation The police can only conduct investigation when they have sufficient reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence in a matter, and such offence should be prima facie disclosed in the FIR. Admittedly, the court has no power to stop the investigation if this condition is fulfilled.  However, the Court is justified to quash an investigation if the FIR does not disclose the commission of such an offence. It is not rational to put an innocent person through harassment by the process of investigation. In the present matter, the Court observed that the FIR did not disclose any offence against the petitioner. Consequently, the Single Bench quashed the FIR while allowing the petition.     
In a rare instance, the Bombay High Court recently directed the Superintendent of Amravati Central Prison to pay the legal expenses or the 'cost of a petition' for denying furlough to a 60-year-old blast convict on "stereotyped reasons".  "Considering the manner in which the impugned order has been passed, recording some worn out reasons, thereby revealing non-application of mind to the important and relevant facts of the case and also the fact that, this is not the first occasion when the petitioner has been required to experience inconvenience, delay and injustice, we are of the view that prayer made by the learned counsel for the petitioner is reasonable and deserves to be granted," the court observed while imposing costs.   A division bench of Justices S.B Shukre and M.W Chandwani noted that 1997-98 Jama Masjid Serial Blast convict Mohd. Sagir Bashir Khan was released on furlough six times in the past and he had surrendered on time and hadn't jumped furlough even once. The court ordered Khan's release on furlough based on his entitlement within seven days.   The court noted that even earlier Khan was forced to approach the HC as furlough was denied by the DIG Prisons, Nagpur for stereotyped reasons despite the DIG of the prison department being duty bound to pass a reasoned order.   "The requirement of recording of reasons under Rule 8(7) of the Prisons Rules, 1959 is not an empty formality and certainly, is not a license for passing an order recording same old reasons almost like a cliché. It is a well settled principle of law that whenever there is discretion, it comes with responsibility to exercise it reasonably, fairly and in a manner as to fulfill the object of legislation under which it is given," the court said.  The applications for furlough are decided under Rule 2 of Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959 by the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons (Regional).  "The discretion conferred upon the sanctioning Authority i.e. the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons, who is respondent no. 1 here, is not unguided and uncanalized," said the court.  Enumerating the consequences of denying relief without recording proper reasons, the bench said:  "Whenever, such mechanical orders are passed, inconvenience [is caused] to the petitioner… putting additional burden on the State exchequer because of the requirement of the prisoner being provided with Legal Aid at the State expense for challenging the order come as inevitable consequences and casualty of justice follows, which can be avoided."  The court said the sanctioning Authority under the Prisons Rules, 1959 must ensure exercise of due care and caution in deciding applications for furlough leave, while keeping in view the settled principles of law. In 2004, a Sessions Court at Mumbai convicted Khan along with 10 others in a case related to a series of blasts between November 1997 to February 1998 at the Jama Masjid Mosque, inside various railway stations and trains. Khan was found guilty for murder, conspiracy amongst various other sections of the IPC, Section 150(2) and Section 151 of the Indian Railways Act read with Section 120-B of IPC & Section 4 of Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Khan was released six times in the past, in 2008, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2021. The bench held that the past conduct of persons like the petitioner in such matters is very important.   Moreover, generalized reasons like; the heinousness of the crime, public wrath, and possibility of disturbance of law-and-order situation, were not enough to deny furlough.  "These reasons do not make any reference to any particular or specific instance on the basis of which one can make a conclusion that the petitioner may face violence out of public outrage that is still going on against him or that there would be possibility of disturbance of law and order."  Accordingly the court ordered his release on furlough leave as per his entitlement subject to reasonable conditions.   Case Title: Mohd. Sagir Bashir Chauhan v. The Deputy Inspector General of Prisons, Eastern Region, Nagpur         
The Supreme Court recently reiterated that the Court’s power to transfer cases to the Central Bureau of Investigation or any other specialised agency is an extraordinary power and therefore, should be used sparingly. A Bench of Justices AS Bopanna and Ahsanuddin Amanullah observed that the transfer of a case should be made to a specialised agency only if there’s no other option of securing a fair trial otherwise.   “Hence it is clear that though there is no inflexible guideline or a straightjacket formula laid down, the power to transfer the investigation is an extraordinary power. It is to be used very sparingly and in an exceptional circumstance where the Court on appreciating the facts and circumstance arrives at the conclusion that there is no other option of securing a fair trial without the intervention and investigation by the CBI or such other specialized investigating agency which has the expertise.”  The Bench was considering an appeal of a person who was accused of alleged possession and sale of 9.2 grams of cocaine. He was challenging two orders of the Chhattisgarh High Court which refused to transfer his case to the CBI and to quash the proceedings initiated against him.  The appellants, for whom Senior Advocates Shyam Divan and Gopal Sankaranarayanan appeared, argued that the appellant was travelling with regard to his business and he was illegally abducted, detained and a case under NDPS has been foisted on him. Owing to this, online complaints were lodged by his father, appellant No.2.   A citizen who is carrying on his lawful business activities in various states has been ‘framed’ and his personal liberty was taken away. This warrants a detailed investigation, it was argued. The appellants, therefore, prayed that the Court exercise its extraordinary power to refer to the matter to CBI.  Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi for the States of Chhattisgarh and Odisha informed that during the investigation it was revealed that the appellant was found to be indulging in the illegal activity in Raipur itself when he was apprehended and proceedings have been initiated. It was further contended that the claim for a CBI-investigation is without basis and is against the established law laid down.   No Need For CBI-Investigation; Other Remedies Available To Appellant Though multiple issues were raised in the appeals, the primary question that the Court dealt with was pertaining to the direction seeking a CBI-investigation.  Relying on the principles laid down in Arnab Ranjan Goswami vs. Union of India, the Court reiterated that the power to transfer an investigation must be used sparingly.  After noting certain factual inconsistencies with the Appellants’ case, the Court looked into whether the ‘seriously disputed facts’ still justified the prayer. “In that background, even if the rival contentions are taken note, we do not find that there is any issue of public importance which requires to be unearthed by an investigation to be conducted by the CBI”, the Bench opined.  Further, in the course of the trial, the five officers specified by the appellants would be available to be cross examined and other orders in that regard can be sought in the pending proceedings, the Court further pointed out.  The Court also highlighted that since the trial is under progress, the appellant would be entitled to put across his case when the statement under Section 313 of CrPC is recorded and also, he would be entitled to tender evidence, if necessary,  While dismissing the appeals, the Court noted that in case the appellant were really “framed”, other remedies to take action for malicious prosecution, loss of reputation, action against involved persons, compensation, among others would be available.  “In addition, in the said process of the judicial proceedings if the appellants bring out the fact that the appellant No.1 who was not involved, had been framed up and a case was foisted, the appellants would still have the legal remedy to take action for malicious prosecution, loss of reputation, action against involved persons, compensation and for such other relief in that regard. Therefore, when the issue raised is only a matter of evidence to be considered in the judicial proceedings to arrive at a conclusion, we are not convinced that in a case of the present nature, a direction to the CBI to hold an investigation would be justified nor is it required at this juncture when the trial in the judicial proceedings has progressed unhindered. Hence to that extent, all contentions of the appellants are kept open.” At this stage, the question of quashing proceedings or discharge also would also not arise, it added.

While disposing of a petition seeking to frame a set of guidelines for proper instruction of physical education in public and private schools, the Madras High Court stressed on the need for physical education in schools.  The court directed the state to constitute a committee to monitor and ensure that physical education is given due importance and requisite infrastructure in all schools is made available.  The committee shall be constituted by the Government within one month and shall be headed by the Secretary to the Government, School Education Department. The committee shall identify the schools not having requisite infrastructure for imparting physical education and ensure physical education is given necessary importance.   The bench of Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice N Mala observed as under:  "At this juncture, it needs to be emphasised that sports and physical activities are integral to education, and therefore, infrastructure for sports is indispensable. Physical activity enhances the physical and mental strength of the student, apart from developing comradeship, instilling discipline and imbibing leadership qualities. The essence of physical education is overall development of the personality and spirit of a student. If such is the essence of sports, how can playgrounds be dispensed with in schools."  The petitioner had contended that the government had not given requisite attention to physical education as a subject in schools, which resulted in inadequate infrastructure in schools and lack of physical education teachers. He had referred to a newspaper report stating that only 40 out of 9,000 schools in Tamil Nadu hired physical education teacher.   The State, on the other hand, submitted a status report informing the court that physical education had been made compulsory in all schools and periodic monitoring of facilities was being conducted by the officials concerned. The state assured that the authorities had taken earnest efforts to ensure that physical education is given equal importance as other subjects and classes would be conducted encouraging physical activity.   The court perused the provisions of law emphasising on the significance of physical activities and sports infrastructure and directed the respondent authorities to ensure that these laws were implemented stricto sensu in CBSE, Matriculation and State Board. The court also directed the authorities to consider the request of schools for utilising public grounds of Municipality/Corporation.   The court further directed the authorities to ensure compliance to the Government Order mandating playgrounds as there were still a number of schools which did not have one.  "The mandate of Government order and the provisions of law should not remain a paper tiger. It is more so when the significance of the physical activity and sports infrastructure has been emphasised even under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009."  Case Title: Dr. P R Subaschandran v. State and others  Case No: WP No. 17095 of 2018  Counsel for the Petitioner: Dr PR Subaschandran, Party-in-person  Counsel for the Respondents: Mr P Muthukumar, State Government Pleader (R1-R7)  
The Delhi High Court recently passed a decree in favour of Dharampal Satyapal Limited - the manufacturers of the iconic pan masala Rajnigandha and permanently halted the production, sale or promotion of any product under the trademark 'RAJNI PAAN', Holding that the defendants had intentionally attempted to "trade off the significant goodwill and reputation of the plaintiffs", the Court directed them to pay Rs 3 lakhs in damages. In 2018, the Court had granted an ex-parte ad interim injunction in the case. A Single Judge Bench of Justice Jyoti Singh, allowing an application filed by the plaintiff for ­ex-parte summary judgement under Order XIII-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, said:  "It appears that Defendants No. 1 to 4 have no real prospect of defending the claim, having chosen to stay away from the proceedings despite service. In these circumstances, Plaintiffs are entitled to a decree under Order XIII-A CPC, as amended by Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, which empowers this Court to pass a summary judgment, without recording evidence, if it appears that Defendants have no real prospect of defending the claims." The plaintiff had filed the suit for permanent injunction restraining infringement and dilution of its trademark and trade name. In September 2018, the company during a market surveillance had come across 'Rajnipaan' products - it also had identical trade dress. Further investigations revealed their wide availability on e-commerce sites. The company then approached the court and was granted interim relief on 29.11.2018. The plaintiff averred that Rajnigandha, which is their flagship product, is sold in "a unique packaging having a distinct layout, getup and colour scheme". Consumers around the world associate the trademark 'RAJNIGANDHA' exclusively with the plaintiff, it was asserted. In the final order, the Court held that a case of infringement of trademark and passing off has been made out. The defendants had dishonestly chosen to adopt a deceptively similar trademark in respect of identical products in order to pass them off as manufactured by the plaintiff, the Court concluded.  It observed: "The packaging of the impugned product has been designed in an identical colour scheme, font and labels, to give an overall look and feel of the Plaintiffs' products under the RAJNIGANDHA marks, which, as rightly contended by the Plaintiffs, has been done intentionally to trade off the significant goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiffs in their RAJNIGANDHA marks. It is obvious that there is a dishonest adoption by the Defendants and Plaintiffs have made out a case of infringement and passing off". The court further said the imitation, adoption and use of the nearly identical trademark, trade name logo and colour scheme by the Defendants is with the intent to cause confusion and create an impression amongst consumers that the Defendants have a direct nexus or affiliation with the Plaintiffs. Justice Singh further noted that once a court finds that there is imitation, no further evidence is required to establish the violation of the plaintiff's rights in an action for infringement.  On this point, the Court relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratana Pharmaceutical Laboratories. The principle of 'initial interest confusion' is also attracted in the case, said the court. "​​This Court finds that Defendants have mischievously and deliberately adopted a deceptively similar mark and have only replaced 'GANDHA' with 'PAAN' with an intention to ride upon goodwill and reputation established by the Plaintiffs," it said. Justice Singh also said Rajnigandha has been previously declared as a well-known trademark by the court and is entitled to a higher degree of protection. The impugned mark is visually and structurally deceptively similar to the plaintiff's mark, the court added. "Given that the trademark RAJNIGANDHA is a "well-known" mark as defined under Section 2(1)(zg) of the Act and entitled to a high degree of protection, even in cases of dissimilar goods the owner of the mark is required to be shielded," said the court. It further said, "Present case stands on a better footing, as the impugned goods of the Defendants are Chillum flavours, registered in Class 34 and the product of the Plaintiffs is Pan Masala, also registered in Class 34. The goods are allied and cognate and the triple identity test is satisfied as the trademark is nearly identical, goods are allied and cognate and the trade channels are identical with same consumer base." The Court, while declining the relief sought by the plaintiff to award damages on account of the lack of evidence, held that they were entitled to notional damages and costs. The Court observed –  "However, in view of the fact that Defendant Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are guilty of infringement by dishonestly adopting nearly identical trademark and identical packaging, trade-dress, etc., and have chosen to deliberately stay away from the proceedings, despite service, for which repeated efforts had been made by the Plaintiffs, this Court is of the view that Plaintiffs are entitled to notional damages…Plaintiffs are also entitled to costs." Finally, the Court issued the following order: "In the light of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, suit is decreed in favour of the Plaintiffs and against Defendants No. 1 to 4 in terms of para 48(i) (a) and (c) of the prayer clause of the plaint. Decree of damages is passed for a sum of Rs. 3,00,000/-. Further, Plaintiffs would be entitled to CS(COMM) 1255/2018 Page 16 of 16 actual costs, which would include Court fee, recoverable jointly from Defendants No. 1 to 4."

Observing that career guidance of students in Class XI and XII is crucial, the Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi government to consider having a system for career counselling of the students to ensure that an informed decision is taken by them regarding their subject choices. Justice Sanjeev Narula in a ruling observed that it is essential that students are counselled in the decision-making process, and asked the authorities to step-in to ensure that there is an appropriate system of counselling or career guidance programmes in schools to assist students.  "If students are made aware of admission policies of different universities, it could only help them in making an informed decision regarding their subject choices. Mr. Unmukt Gera, counsel for GNCTD, states that such systems must be in place, although he is unable to readily cite the same. Accordingly, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to GNCTD/ DoE to examine this issue in consultation with experts in the field and in case, any lacunae is required to be filled-in, they may do so by issuing appropriate directions to schools," the court said. The court made the observations in its judgement on a plea filed by a father whose son failed to secure admission in colleges affiliated with Delhi University in 2020. The petitioner blamed the lack of career guidance at school for it. His argument was that when his son opted for Mass Media Studies and Physical Education in Class XI and XII, he was not cautioned that these subjects are not considered as "Main" subjects by DU and are instead treated as "Elective" attracting penalty of 2.5% deduction of marks from aggregate marks for the purpose of selection in colleges of DU. The petition prayed for intervention of statutory authorities like Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Delhi government to ensure proper dispensation of information and guidance to students at the time of subject selection in Class XI and XII. It also sought action against the school and compensation for the alleged prejudice caused to the students. The court said the prayer seeking cancellation of the accreditation of the school, lacks foundation and is untenable. "Improper career counselling to some students cannot be a ground for de-affiliation/ de-accreditation, in absence of any statutory provision that provides for such a penalty," it added. Rejecting the prayer seeking compensation considering that highly disputed facts have emerged from the pleadings, the court said the school has asserted that guidelines issued by CBSE are diligently followed and students in Class XI are free to opt any subjects prescribed by CBSE. "They explain that Petitioner opted for the subjects voluntarily and in consultation with his parents. All of the subjects taught/ available in the School, are recognised by CBSE and here is no basis for the School to consider some subjects more favourable than others. The School does not dissuade students from opting any subject. In light of the above, there is no basis for the Court to hold that the choice exercised by Petitioner was not voluntarily or was exercised under persuasion," Justice Narula said. The court further said there is also no reason for it to hold that the school should have disapproved or opposed the option because of its likely impact on admission prospects to DU. "Petitioner's contention is farfetched and exhibits a very orthodox approach towards education centred around scoring marks. The School, on the other hand, would have a different approach of holistic development of students and would encourage them to select subjects based on their aptitude. Scoring of marks cannot therefore, be the sole criteria for selecting a subject," it said. Observing that prayer seeking consideration of the petitioner's admission has become infructuous, the court said Common University Entrance Test has now been introduced for the admissions. The court also noted that the student has been able to secure admission in some other college and he is continuing his education there. "Moreover, the Court has no reason to direct DU to dilute its standards for admission, as fixing the eligibility criteria is a policy- decision and lies within the exclusive domain of the University. No foundation or legal right has been demonstrated before this Court to issue any directions to DU qua admission procedure followed by them for intake of students under the erstwhile admission regime," it said. However, while disposing of the direction, the court issued a direction to the government with regard to career counselling of Class XI and Class XII students. Title: SHISHRAM AS GUARDIAN OF MR.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently termed the bane of live-in-relationship as a by-product of the Constitutional guarantee as provided under Article 21 of the Constitution, and has observed that such relations promote 'promiscuity' and 'lascivious behavior', giving further rise to sexual offences. "Those who wanted to exploit this freedom are quick to embrace it but are totally ignorant that it has its own limitations, and does not confer any right on any of the partners to such relationship," the bench of Justice Subodh Abhyankar further remarked as it rejected the anticipatory bail of a 25-year-old man who has been accused of raping a woman, with whom he allegedly had a live in relation. "The bane of live-in-relationship is a by-product of the Constitutional guarantee as provided under Art.21 of the Constitution, engulfing the ethos of Indian society, and promoting promiscuity and lascivious behavior, giving further rise to sexual offences" : Madhya Pradesh HC. pic.twitter.com/k63pXWrKiO— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) April 19, 2022 The case in brief An FIR was lodged by the prosecutrix/victim against the accused-applicant alleging that she was friends with the present applicant and at one point of time, he called her to his room and offered her cold drink and after drinking of which she fell unconscious and thereafter he committed rape on her. Allegedly, he also made a video of the same and subsequently, he kept on committing rape on her on the threat that he would viral her video with him. Further, it was also alleged hat the prosecutrix also got pregnant for more than a couple of times and got it terminated, allegedly under the pressure of the present applicant. Now, when the prosecutrix was engaged to someone by her father, the applicant started harassing her parents, her uncle, and her fiancé and his family by sending messages, photographs and also threatening them that if the prosecutrix marries some other person, he would viral her videos and photographs. Pursuant to the lodging of FIR and neing booked for offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(N), 328, 313, 506 and 34 of IPC, the applicant moved to the High Court seeking anticipatory bail. Court's observations and order At the outset, the Court noted that as per the case diary and the various documents filed by the applicant, it was apparent that the prosecutrix and the applicant were having live-in-relationship for quite some time and during this time, the prosecutrix also got pregnant for more than a couple of times and had to terminate the same allegedly under the pressure of the present applicant.  The Court further noted that subsequently, things got sore between them, and when the prosecutrix was engaged to some other person, the applicant, being a jilted lover, resorted to blackmailing the prosecutrix and sent his video clips to the in-laws of the prosecutrix that he would commit suicide and for which they would also be held responsible together with the family of the prosecutrix.  Calling the acts of the applicant 'serious', the Court opined the applicant had sent the video clips with a view to make sure that the proposed marriage of the prosecutrix does not get materialized. "How much stress his acts must have caused to the prosecutrix, her family members as also other persons is not difficult to comprehend," the Court remarked. Against this backdrop, taking note of the spurt of such offences in recent times arising out of live-in-relationship, the Court dismissed the anticipatory bail plea as it observed thus: "...this court is forced to observe that the bane of live-in-relationship is a by-product of Constitutional guarantee as provided under Art.21 of the Constitution, engulfing the ethos of Indian society, and promoting promiscuity and lascivious behavior, giving further rise to sexual offences. Those who wanted to exploit this freedom are quick to embrace it but are totally ignorant that it has its own limitations, and does not confer any right on any of the partners to such relationship. The applicant appears to have fallen into this trap and portraying himself as a victim, has assumed that once he has a relationship with the prosecutrix, he can also force himself upon her for all the time to come, having her various photographs and video clips etc..."

The Kerala High Court on Saturday held that the prosecution has every right to seek that the accused should surrender mobile phones for forensic examination under Section 79A of the Information Technology Act. The Court rejected the argument that the surrender of mobile phones will infringe the fundamental right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India.   Accordingly, it directed actor Dileep and other accused to hand over six mobile phones to its Registrar General in a sealed box by 10.15 am on Monday in the alleged criminal conspiracy to kill police officers investigating the sensational 2017 sexual assault case. After referring to a couple of landmark decisions in this area, Justice Gopinath P. ruled: "Bound, as I am, by the law...I hold that the prosecution has every right to seek that the accused hand over the mobile phones in question for the purpose of forensic examination by an agency identified by the Central Government as 'Examiner of Electronic Evidence' under Section 79-A of the Information Technology Act, 2000." Senior Advocate B. Raman Pillai appearing for the accused in the matter suggested that any direction to produce the mobile phones would amount to the violation of the right against self-incrimination guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.  However, Director General of Prosecutions T.A Shaji appearing for the prosecution vehemently argued that there is no question of violation of Article 20(3) as the direction to produce a document or a thing does not amount to self-incrimination.  He added that the investigating agency has every power to demand the production of mobile phones in question as the data contained in the same has to be verified for the purpose of investigation. It was further submitted that the Karnataka High Court had recently considered this issue in Virendra Khanna v. State of Karnataka & Ors.   After carefully perusing the arguments and advanced and the law laid down on this subject, the Court took the view that the issue raised was no longer res integra.  To confirm this stand, the Court referred to an 11-judge bench decision of the Supreme Court State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad [AIR 1962 SC 1809] where it was held that giving thumb impressions or impressions of foot/palm/fingers or specimen writings or showing parts of the body by way of identification does not violate Article 20(3).  The Judge noted that this decision was relied on heavily by other landmark judgments such as K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (which held the right to privacy as a fundamental right) and Ritesh Sinha v. State of U.P. (which held that Magistrate can direct accused to give voice samples without his consent). The Court also observed that in Virendra Khanna (supra), the Karnataka High Court had held so:  "Mere providing of an access of to smartphone or e-mail account would not amount to being a witness, the information that is accessed by the Investigating officer on the smartphone and or the e-mail account being only access; to the data and/or documents, it is for the Investigating officer to prove and establish the same in a Court of law by following the applicable Rules of evidence."  Finding force in the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Oghad (supra) and the Karnataka High Court in Virendra Khanna (supra), the Single Bench held that the prosecution was empowered to seek that the accused to hand over their mobile phones for the purpose of forensic examination. The Court issued the order in the anticipatory bail plea moved by Dileep and others in the alleged criminal conspiracy to kill police officers investigating the sensational 2017 sexual assault case.

In a first, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, while dealing with a bail plea, sought the response of the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT to get a broader outlook of the bail jurisprudence across the world. To assess the worldwide view on bail when the assault is laced with cruelty, the bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara used the AI tool and put the following question to it: "What is the jurisprudence on bail when the assailants assaulted with cruelty?" ChatGPT came up with the following response: "The jurisprudence on bail for cases where the assailants have assaulted with cruelty will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction where the case is being tried. However, in general, if the assailants have been charged with a violent crime that involves cruelty, such as murder, aggravated assault, or torture, they may be considered a danger to the community and a flight risk. In such cases, the judge may be less inclined to grant bail or may set the bail amount very high to ensure that the defendant appears in court and does not pose a risk to public safety. The severity of the assault, the defendant's criminal history, and the strength of the evidence against them are all factors that a judge will consider when deciding whether to grant bail. It is important to note that the presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of the justice system, and all defendants are entitled to bail unless there are compelling reasons to deny it. Therefore, even in cases where the assailants have assaulted with cruelty, they may still be granted bail if the judge determines that they do not pose a risk to the community or a flight risk." However, the Court clarified that any reference to ChatGPT was neither an expression of opinion on the merits of the case nor shall the trial Court advert to these comments and that the it was only intended to present a broader picture of bail jurisprudence, where cruelty is a factor. Essentially, the bench had the ocassion to refer to the AI chatbot while dealing with the bail plea of one Jaswinder Singh @ Jassi who has been accused of brutally assaulting the deceased along with his accomplices leading to his death. In its order, the Court noted that the complainant and the deceased, who were unarmed were waylaid by the petitioner and his other accomplices and attacked in an abhorrent manner as substantiated by the nature of injuries on their bodies. The Court observed that causing death itself is cruel but if the cruelty causes death, the tables turn. It also opined that when the physical assault is done with an element of cruelty, the parameters of bail also change. Stressing that when the offense is heinous and the crime is brutal, cruelty becomes one of the factors in granting or refusing bail, the Court noted thus: "The impact of individuals who act with cruelty is devastating not only for those on whom the direct harm and pain is inflicted but also on a systemic level. Cruel individuals contribute to sustain the greater deficiencies of society like gender, economic and social inequalities. Once the courts form a prima facie opinion that the accused acted with cruelty, then such an accused ordinarily should not be granted bail, and if the courts still deem it appropriate to grant, then it must be after specifying the reasons for such an indulgence." Further, the Court took note of the fact that the bail applicant had a criminal history of two cases and there was nothing on record which could assure the Court that if the accused is released on bail, then he shall not indulge in criminal behavior and will not abscond. Against this backdrop, the Court concluded that an analysis of the allegations, injuries, and evidence collected points out that the accused and some of his accomplices acted with ferociousness and total lack of mercy which does not warrant the grant of bail to the accused. Case title - Jaswinder Singh @ Jassi vs. State of Punjab and another    
The Delhi High Court has held that all the candidates belonging to reserved categories as notified by a Presidential Order in any state or union territory would be entitled to reservation benefit in Delhi subordinate services.  "If a candidate is able to furnish a certificate of belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe – which may otherwise be issued only by the competent authority where such a candidate is ordinarily resident – he cannot be denied the benefit of reservation as specified under the Notification."  A division bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice Amit Mahajan was dealing with a bunch of pleas filed by candidates, belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) category, who had appeared for interview for the post of "Court Attendant/Room Attendant (Group-C)" in the High Court but were not recommended for appointment for not submitting any proof of being ordinarily resident of Delhi.  The question which arose for consideration was whether the candidates were ineligible for appointment under the reserved category in the High Court's establishment on the ground that their caste certificates were issued outside Delhi. The court noted that in terms of the notification for recruitment by high court, applications were invited from all the citizens without any qualification as to their place of residence.  It also noted that it was not the case of the court's establishment that persons belonging to SC and ST category of another state were not eligible to apply.  "Concededly, there is no requirement for a general category candidate to establish that he is an ordinarily resident of Delhi for qualifying for the said appointment. The requirement for a candidate to be an ordinarily resident of Delhi has been carved out only in respect of candidates, who claim reservation by virtue of belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, as notified in relation to a State other than National Capital Territory of Delhi," the court said.  Relying on various judgments of the Supreme Courts, the court said a person who belongs to a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in another State is not entitled to benefits extended to the reserved categories in another State as they would not belong to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in relation to that State.  "Insofar as the services under the National Capital Territory of Delhi are concerned, the decision in the case of Bir Singh v. Delhi Jal Board & Ors. and Deepak Kumar & Ors. v. District and Sessions Judge, Delhi and Ors. hold that the rule of pan-India reservation would be applicable. Thus, all candidates belonging to reserved categories notified by the Presidential Order in any State or Union Territory would be entitled to benefit of reservation in the subordinate services in the National Capital Territory of Delhi," it said.  Allowing the pleas, the court directed its establishment to consider appointment of the petitioner candidates to the advertised posts under the quota for the reserved category candidates without insisting on them being ordinarily residents of Delhi.  This is subject to the petitioners otherwise qualifying for such appointment in the order of merit, the bench added. Title: ASHU & ORS v. THE REGISTRAR GENERAL, HIGH COURT OF DELHI AND ORS.     
The Jharkhand High Court recently denied bail to Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer Pooja Singhal in connection with a money laundering case registered against her pertaining to the alleged embezzlement of MGNREGA funds in Khunti district during 2009-2010 and some other suspicious financial transactions. While denying her bail, the bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi noted that the apprehension of the Enforcement Directorate with regard to tempering with the evidence cannot be ruled out.  The Court also took into account the fact that during the probe into the matter, the allegations had surfaced that she was indeed involved in the laundering of a huge amount of money. The case in brief Singhal was posted as Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Khunti between February 16, 2009, and July 19, 2010, wherein she was the principal authority for sanctioning funds for different development projects. Allegedly, in connivance with the co-accused, she managed to do defalcation of funds in different development projects.  In lieu of the same, she used to obtain the illegal commission from one Ram Binod Prasad Sinha/coaccused (Junior Engineer) in cash and ignored all the irregularities and misdeeds by him.  It came out in the inquiry conducted in this matter subsequently, that there were huge differences in the quantum of funds released to the Junior Engineer and the quantity of the completed work in respective projects. In many cases, it was seen that the construction work of nominal value was done against the withdrawal of a substantial amount allocated for the given project.  Pursuant to this, on May 6 this year, the ED conducted searches at several properties linked to Singhal and two others (her husband and her CA) and it recovered Rs 19.76 crore cash. She along with her CA was arrested and sent to judicial custody by the court of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The case of the ED is that Singhal used to receive a 5% "illegal commission" in development projects in Khunti from funds she disbursed for the works under MGNREGA. She maintained two PAN and an amount of Rs 73.81 lakh was found deposited in her ICICI bank accounts. Of the Rs 73.81 lakh, Rs 61.5 lakh was found to have been deposited between 2009-11, which the ED alleges, constituted "proceeds of crime".  On the other hand, moving the High Court seeking bail in the matter, her counsel denied all the charges and allegations leveled against her and argued that she is a responsible IAS officer who constituted a committee to look into the alleged embezzlement of the funds. Court's observations At the outset, the Court noted that a sum of Rs.01.33 crore had been deposited in the form of cash in the name of the brother of her Chartered Accountant and her mother and therefore, it cannot be said that she was not using the proceeds of crime in light of section 2(1)(u) of the PML Act. "The allegation prima facie suggests that it has a direct link with the "proceeds of crime". In that, the property derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to notified offences, termed as a scheduled offence, is regarded as tainted property, and dealing with such property in any manner is an offence of money laundering," the Court remarked. Further, the Court also took into account the alleged modus operandi as adopted by Singhal wherein she first opened bank accounts for a short duration, then deposited huge cash into it, then converted those cash into demand drafts to purchase insurance policies of longer durations and prematurely closed those policies to bring back liquidity in her accounts for further investment.  The Court also noted that she used to invest the same either in the form of capital infusion by her brother Siddharth Singhal and her husband Abhishek Jha who is also an accused in their company M/s Pulse Sanjeevani Healthcare Private Ltd. A huge amount of cash amounting to Rs.73.81 lakhs was deposited in her various ICICI bank accounts. The Court further took into account the submission that a false certificate was tried to be obtained on the medical ground to obtain the benefit of a medical certificate by her and that she had not been able to succeed due to the presence of the authority of the Enforcement Directorate). The Court also noted that the medical report suggested that she was well oriented stable and fit medically and psychologically. Consequently, noting that the apprehension with regard to tempering with the evidence cannot be ruled out, the Court refused to grant her the benefit of regular bail to her.

The court adopted a reformative approach for the two first-time offenders and remarked that today's youth, with their "now or never" attitude, cannot foresee the consequences of their actions.The Bombay High Court granted bail to two young men arrested for possession and consumption of drugs observing that prima facie purchasing drugs for another person at a party would not make one a drug peddler to attract the rigours of section 37 for bail under the NDPS Act.

The Bombay High Court granted bail to two young men arrested for possession and consumption of drugs observing that prima facie purchasing drugs for another person at a party would not make one a drug peddler to attract the rigours of section 37 for bail under the NDPS Act.  Justice Bharti Dangre adopted the reformative approach for the two first-time offenders and remarked that today's youth, with their "now or never" attitude, cannot foresee the consequences of their actions.   The two petitioners, arrested under sections 20, 21, 25 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) in June 2021, sought bail on the grounds that commercial quantity of drugs was not seized, mandatory provisions for search under sections 42 and 50 were not followed, and that the young men had learnt their lesson after spending two months in prison.   The prosecution argued that the first petitioner had organized the birthday party with 27 attendees at Igatpuri, Maharashtra, and the second petitioner was found in possession of 5.72 gms of cocaine and was in contact with the drug mafia.   The prosecution said that, "Traces of cocaine were also found in the swimming pool, and if the quantity of cocaine (once the FSL report comes) in 1 litre was multiplied with the quantity of water in the swimming pool (50k litres approximately), it would become a commercial quantity. Therefore the rigours of section 37 of the NDPS Act would apply."  However, Justice Dangre observed that prima facie, the second petitioner's calls with the Nigerian national, seemed to be for drug consumption at the party, and he couldn't be called a 'drug peddler' by any stretch of the imagination.   "At this stage, there is no material to indicate that the operation was a part of a crime syndicate, where drugs are sold and purchased and that the Applicant - Harsh, who has brought the substance and offered the same to other accused present in the party, by no stretch of imagination, would assign him the role of a drug peddler," the judge observed.   The court felt that the two deserved a chance at reformation with a forewarning that law wouldn't spare them if they repeated their actions or were found guilty during the trial.   Justice Dangre found the prosecution's arguments on calculating swimming pool contraband "obscure" and "outlandish."   "The NDPS Act imposes deterrent sentences upon those who traffic in significant quantities of drugs and addicts, who are addicted to its consumption…The applicants are not attributed with any antecedents of being involved previously in the consumption or use of drugs …considering their young age where they are in a stage of reformation, they deserve one opportunity by restoring their freedom, nevertheless with a forewarning."  Justice Dangre emphasized that today's youth, with their "now or never" attitude, cannot forsee the consequences of their actions.   "Adolescence and youth are the phases of lifetime, where making of irrational and impulsive decisions may be favoured by some. The challenge of today mainly focuses on the issue of drug addiction in youth and how to tackle it. Experimentation with alcohol and drugs is common. Unfortunately, the youths do not foresee the link between their action today and its consequences tomorrow."  The court further observed that the menace of drugs is a reality that would require posing serious questions to get to the root of the issue. "It indeed is a harrowing reality."

The Bombay High Court has directed the State Government to sympathetically and expeditiously consider the case of a young woman for appointment to a non-constabulary post in the police department, three years after a medical test declared her a "male."  The woman had qualified with flying colours in 2018 from the Nashik Rural Police Recruitment drive from the Scheduled Caste category but based on her medical test, her marks didn't make the cut off for the men's category.  "It is an extremely unfortunate case. The petitioner comes from a poor economic strata of the Society; her parents are doing sugarcane cutting work; the petitioner is the eldest in the family… It appears that right from the beginning, the petitioner was not aware that she was any different…No fault can be found in the petitioner, as, throughout, she has pursued her career as a female. Infact, according to the petitioner, she has all female attributes," the court said in the order.   A division bench of Justice Revati Mohite Dere and Justice Madhav Jamdar passed the order after the Advocate General's assurance that the case would be considered on priority and all benefits of a normally appointed employee would be made available to her.   Observing that the "wait has already been too long" the court asked the State to decide within 4 weeks of receiving the assured recommendation from the police department for her appointment.   The woman was 19 when she applied to the police department. She scored 171 out of 200 marks in her written and physical tests and. However, when she was sent for a mandatory medical examination to JJ Hospital, a sonography revealed "her uterus and ovaries were absent and a prostate-like structure was seen at the base of her bladder".   Another karyotyping test at the National Institute of Immuno-haematology (KEM Hospital) showed she has both "XY" (male and female) chromosomes. They opined she was a male.   Anyhow, with the SC category cut off for men being 181 of 200, she was ineligible. She was informed about this thought an RTI.   She then approached the Bombay High Court through advocate Vijay Kumar Garad. He argued that his client was qualified for the job and couldn't be denied a job merely because of a karyotyping test, especially when the results were not made available to her.   The Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni took up the matter with the State Government to consider the petitioner's as a special case. He said that the Special Inspector General will make a recommendation to the Home Department for her appointment to a non-constabulary post.   The petitioner would be treated at par with other normally recruited employees and would be entitled for all the benefits, including promotions, etc.  "We appreciate the sensitivity and alacrity shown by the learned Advocate General and the State Authorities," the bench said while disposing of the petition.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently directed state government to pay 50,000/- to an NDPS Act accused within 15 days for "violation of his fundamental right" who has been behind bars since January 2018 and the prosecution failed to present its witnesses before the Court for the trial.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently directed state government to pay 50,000/- to an NDPS Act accused within 15 days for "violation of his fundamental right" who has been behind bars since January 2018 and the prosecution failed to present its witnesses before the Court for the trial.  The Bench of Justice G. S. Ahluwalia was hearing the 10th bail plea of one Jaipal Singh on the ground of delay in the trial when it noted that State Government was continuously blatantly violating the fundamental right of the applicant of speedy trial.  The matter in brief  The applicant had been arrested on January 5, 2018 for the offence under Section 8/20 of NDPS Act, however, even till June 2020, the trial couldn't commence and therefore, the Court in June 2020 awarded 20,000/- compensation to the bail applicant on account of the nonappearance of the prosecution witnesses.  The Court had directed to recover the same from the salary of two Inspectors, however, the Court was not apprised as to whether the compensation amount had been paid to the applicant Jaipal Singh or not.  Now, filing the instant bail plea, the applicant submitted that the situation had not improved and still, the prosecution witnesses were not appearing for the trial.  Against this backdrop, the Court observed thus:  "The prosecution is not interested in early disposal of the trial and every prosecution witness who is police personnel is taking trial for granted, and are not appearing before the Trial Court without assigning any reason and permission from the Court."  Importantly, underling that no one can be kept behind the bars at the whims and wishes of the prosecution witnesses, the Court also observed thus:  "If the prosecution is not in a position to keep its witnesses present, then they must think it seriously as to whether they should go for the prosecution of the accused or not. The filing of the charge sheet is not the end of the duty of the prosecution. It is their duty to ensure that the witnesses appear before the Trial Court regularly without any default so that the fate of a person can be decided on the basis of pieces of evidence"  Ordering a 50K compensation to the accused, the Court also directed that since the Superintendent of Police, Bhind had miserably failed in ensuring the appearance of his own police witnesses before the Trial Court, therefore, the compensation be recovered from the salary of the Superintendent of Police, Bhind.  Further, the State Government was also directed to initiate a Departmental Enquiry against Sub-inspector, who did not appear before the Trial Court on March 15, 2021, in spite of service of summons.   The State Government was also directed to start Departmental Inquiry against the constable who did not serve the bailable warrants on Vinod Chhawai and did not return the same either served or unserved.  Lastly, directing that the trial be completed within 3 months, the Trial Court has been asked to fix the case on day to day basis.  The Court has also made it the personal duty and responsibility of Superintendent of Police, Bhind to ensure that all the prosecution witnesses appear before the Trial Court on the date which will be fixed by the Trial Court.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that educational qualification is a valid ground for classification between persons of the same class in matters of promotion. In the judgment delivered in the case Chandan Banerjee & Ors v. Krishna Prosad Ghosh & Ors, a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli held that such classification on the basis of educational qualification is not violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Holding so, the Court upheld the validity of separate eligibility conditions for promotion to Supernumerary Assistant Engineers having diploma and degrees in Kolkata Municipal Corporation.  The judgment authored by Justice Chandrachud observed that the legislature or delegatee in matters of public policy and public employment must be given sufficient room to decide the quality of individuals it seeks to employ as against different positions. Principles on classification Relying on the Apex Court decisions in State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Trilokinath Khosa (1974) 1 SCC 19, State of Mysore v. P Narasing Rao AIR 1968 SC 349 ; Ganga Ram v. Union of India (1970) 1 SCC 377, Union of India v. Dr (Mrs) SB Kohli (1973) 3 SCC 592 and Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India AIR 1967 SC 1889; Roop Chand Adlakha v. Delhi Development Authority and others 1989 Supp (1) SCC 116; M Rathinaswami v. State of Tamil Nadu (2009) 2 SCC (LS) 101; State of Uttarakhand v. SK Singh (2019) 10 SCC 49, the bench observed that the following principles emerged:  (i) Classification between persons must not produce artificial inequalities. The classification must be founded on a reasonable basis and must bear nexus to the object and purpose sought to be achieved to pass the muster of Articles 14 and 16;  (ii) Judicial review in matters of classification is limited to a determination of whether the classification is reasonable and bears a nexus to the object sought to be achieved. Courts cannot indulge in a mathematical evaluation of the basis of classification or replace the wisdom of the legislature or its delegate with their own;  (iii) Generally speaking, educational qualification is a valid ground for classification between persons of the same class in matters of promotion and is not violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution;  (iv) Persons drawn from different sources and integrated into a common class can be differentiated on grounds of educational qualification for the purpose of promotion, where this bears a nexus with the efficiency required in the promotional post;  (v) Educational qualification may be used for introducing quotas for promotion for a certain class of persons; or may even be used to restrict promotion entirely to one class, to the exclusion of others;   (vi) Educational qualification may be used as a criterion for classification for promotion to increase administrative efficiency at the higher posts; and   (vii) However, a classification made on grounds of educational qualification should bear nexus to the purpose of the classification or the extent of differences in qualifications  Facts Of The Case   Calcutta Municipal Corporation Services (Common Cadres) Regulations ("Regulations") were notified by Kolkata Municipal Corporation ("KMC") on December 23, 1994, which were applicable to all the employees under all departments and offices and provided for management and control of common cadres, seniority and recruitment among other conditions of service. Rule 9 of the Regulations provided for the method of recruitment for the post of Assistant Engineers ("AE") and Subordinate Assistant Engineers ("SAE"). To provide three modes of appointment to the post of AE, the Regulations were modified on August 7, 1997, and the KMC thereafter modified the Recruitment Regulations for the post of AE and notified them by a circular dated February 20, 2002.  The circular dated February 20, 2002, was challenged in a writ before the High Court which was disposed with granting liberty to the petitioners to make a representation before the KMC. In an effort to remove stagnation in promotion to the next higher post of AE from the post of SAE, a circular was issued dated June 17, 2008 which was called as "first career advancement scheme" as it awarded basic scale of pay (Rs. 8,000 - 275/- 1000) of an AE to SAEs who have completed twenty years of satisfactory service in the KMC.  The KMC on July 3, 2012 issued a circular ("impugned circular")which was considered to be the second career advancement scheme that stipulated the creation of supernumerary AE posts for SAEs holding a diploma and having completed twenty-five years of services and SAEs holding a degree and having completed thirteen years of services (out of which 5 years were as degree holder). In pursuance of the July 3 circular, an office order dated July 5, 2021 was published which had names of the SAE's who had been promoted to the post of AE against the supernumerary posts.  Aggrieved, the SAEs possessing a diploma in engineering approached the High Court. The Single Judge of the High Court on October 6, 2015 observed that when persons having different educational qualifications are subject to a common recruitment process and are selected thereafter, a subsequent classification in that cadre would be in violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The Single Judge also observed that the classification for promotion was not made to reward those SAEs who had improved their educational qualification during service, but instead was a benefit granted to all degree holders.  On the contrary, in letter patent appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court by order dated January 25, 2019 upheld the validity of the impugned circular and gradation list and observed that classification made on the basis of educational qualifications for supernumerary appointments to the higher post of Assistant Engineer was valid.  Aggrieved by the order dated January 25, 2019 the Division Bench, SAE's possessing diploma in engineering approached the Top Court.  Submissions Of Counsel   Appearing for the SAE's possessing diploma, Senior Counsel Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya submitted that the effect of the impugned circular would be that a junior SAE holding a degree would be promoted faster than a senior SAE holding a diploma and having more experience. It was also his contention that the High Court had failed to appreciate the ratio laid down in State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Shri Trilokinath Khosa (1974) 1 SCC 19 in which the Top Court had upheld separate channels of promotion for degree holders and diploma holders as they had been recruited through different channels on the basis of their qualifications.  Appearing for KMC, Advocate Sujoy Mondal contended that the Recruitment Regulations provided that educational qualification was one of the criteria for recruitment as well as promotion in the Engineering Service of KMC. It was also his contention that the impugned circular's purpose was to open promotion avenues for stagnating SAE's and that neither any substantive promotional post of AE or any financial benefit was granted to SAE's through the impugned circular.  Representing the degree-holding SAE's, Advocate Amit Sharma contended that the present case was similar to Roop Chand Adlakha v. Delhi Development Authority and Others, 1989 Supp (1) SCC 116 where category of Junior Engineers comprise of graduates and diploma holders and a rule providing for different length of qualifying service for promotion was challenged and the Top Court while upholding the rule had observed that differences in educational qualification could be compensated by difference in length of experience required in feeder post.  Court's Observations   Observing that the reading of State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Shri Trilokinath Khosa (1974) 1 SCC 19 as urged by the SAE's holding diploma was fundamentally flawed, the Top Court observed that,  "The appellants have sought to lay emphasis on the fact that the decision in Trilokinath Khosa (supra) was dependent on the existence of two different sources of recruitment, while in the present case there is a single source of recruitment. To read the decision in this light is to miss the wood for the trees. In Trilokinath Khosa (supra), the Court had adverted to the well-established principle that once direct recruits and promotees are integrated into a common pool, they cannot be treated differently based on the 'source of recruitment'. This however does not imply that they cannot be classified on other reasonable grounds. Thus, whether there are two different streams of recruitment, or a single source of recruitment merged into a common pool, the classification that was upheld in Trilokinath Khosa (supra) was based on the educational qualification which was linked to the purpose of enhancing administrative efficiency in the organization. We are unable to agree with the submission of the appellants that the decision in Trilokinath Khosa (supra) is not applicable in the present case."  The bench while upholding the High Court's view further observed that,   "The impugned circular indicates that these supernumerary posts were created for removal of stagnation amongst SAEs. Although that may be the stated goal of the impugned circular, KMC has urged before this Court that the distinction in education qualification for promotion has been made for the purpose of enhancing administrative efficiency. It cannot be denied that SAEs once promoted to the post of an AE in these supernumerary posts would be performing the task and functions of an AE. Thus, it is not merely a change in the designation of an SAE to an AE, but involves an increase in workload, supervisory functions, and performance of the regular functions of an AE. Since that is the case, we do not find any reason why the rationale underlying the need for higher degree-holders in the AE cadre through regular promotion would not be applicable in the case of supernumerary posts." "While creating supernumerary posts, KMC has not completely restricted the promotional avenues of diploma-holder SAEs who have stagnated in their service. It has provided adequate opportunity to them to advance in their career, although on different terms and conditions. Thus, the promotional policy of KMC for supernumerary posts is not irrational or arbitrary or to the detriment of diploma holder SAEs. In matters of public policy and public employment, the legislature or its delegate must be given sufficient room to decide the quality of individuals it seeks to employ as against different positions. As long as these decisions are not arbitrary, this Court must refrain from interfering in the policy domain,"  the bench observed.  Case Title: Chandan Banerjee & Ors v. Krishna Prosad Ghosh & Ors.

Hearing a plea filed by a runaway couple (a minor girl and a 28-year-old boy), claiming to be married and seeking protection, the Punjab & Haryana High Court last week directed the Chandigarh SSP to take over the custody of the minor girl (petitioner no. 1). The Bench of Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi also gave the liberty to the police to take appropriate action against the 28-year-old boy (petitioner no. 2), in accordance with law as may be warranted by the facts and circumstances of the case. The case in brief The runaway couple had moved the Court seeking protection of their life and liberty on the averments that they performed marriage on June 16, 2021, at their friend's residence as per Hindu rites and ceremonies against the wishes of respondents No.4 to 6. The Girl claimed her age to be about 17 years and 6 months, and the Man claimed that he is 28 years of age and they submitted that they are apprehending a threat to their life and liberty. Their Counsel submitted that the petitioners, after performing marriage are living together, and that no action for the protection of their life and liberty had been taken by the police despite making of representation by them and thus, a direction in this regard was sought to respondents No.2 and 3 for protection of their life and liberty. The State Counsel submitted that the Girl is less than 18 years of age falling within the definition of child under Section 2(a) of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.  Further, submitting that the Man was not entitled to the custody of a minor girl, it was submitted that Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 provides punishment for 1 of a person who performs child marriage.  Lastly, he argued that the life and liberty of the minor girl had to be protected by sending her to a child care institution under the care of the Child Welfare Committee. Court's order In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, adjourning the case to July 23, 2021, the Senior Superintendent of Police, U.T. Chandigarh was directed to take over custody of the minor girl from the Man petitioner and ordered that till further orders to the contrary, she be kept in Aashiana, Sector-15, Chandigarh. The SSP was also directed to take appropriate action for the protection of her life and liberty from danger at the instance of respondents No.4 to 6 and the Court clarified that all the expenses for a stay of the minor girl in Aashiana, Sector-15, Chandigarh shall be borne by the U.T. Chandigarh.  Read Order

The Allahabad High Court today denied bail to two UP Police officials, SO Vinay Kumar Tiwari & Beat Officer Krishna Kumar Sharma, who are facing conspiring charges in connection with the ambush in Bikru village on July 3, 2020, in which eight policemen were gunned down by Gangster Vikas Dubey. The Court started with the famous statement made by Justice VR Krishna Iyer "Who will police the police" 40 years ago in a judgment. "About 40 years have passed, but, that question is still there with a bigger question mark", the Court observed.  The Bench of Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava observed that it is not an unknown phenomenon that there are policemen, maybe very few in numbers, who show their loyalty more to such gangsters than to their department for the reasons best known to them.  "Such policemen tarnish the image, name, and fame of police and it is necessary that suspicious police personnel should be taken to task and their conduct should be regularly monitored for which a mechanism should be evolved, and if it exists already, the same should be geared up at different levels," the Court further added.  The case against the accused-applicants  The accused applicants Vinay Kumar Tiwari and K.K. Sharma have been booked under sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 307, 504, 506, 353, 332, 333, 396, 412, 120B, 34 IPC, section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act, and section ¾ of Explosive Substances Act.  It has been alleged that under a conspiracy, they leaked information of police raid to Dubey and gave them an opportunity to remain in preparedness and also, both of them did not render due support to police personnel, nor informed the police force regarding their preparedness to effectively counter the raid and they're being equipped with sophisticated firearms.   The accusation against the accused applicants is that they had a close friendly relationship with the gangster Vikas Dubey who and the members of his gang were running organized criminal activities of all sorts and was residing and flourishing within the local jurisdiction of the police station in which both the applicants were posted.   The IO has examined several witnesses and they have stated about the close relationship of the applicants with the gangster Vikas Dubey and gang.  Submissions made before the Court  The State submitted that Vikas Dubey had given a statement to the IO before his death that he had prior information about the raid.   On the basis of a study of CDR, the State argued that on the date of the incident, prior to the incident, the accused persons contacted each other and this call pattern is exceptional in the last one month as this type of communication between them was unique. It was also contended that several calls were made to Dubey by the accused, before the incident.  Importantly, it was also argued that accused-applicant K.K. Sharma, gave information to the gangster and was working as an agent to the aid and assistance of the gangster, and that it is why he kept himself in the police station deliberately on the day of the raid.  Lastly, it was submitted that at no point in time, applicant Vinay Tiwari along with the members of his team responded to provide any backup to the team.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that it was clear that the accused, who were posted in the same police station could not have any professional relationship with the gangster and his men, and communication on mobile with him is certainly a relevant circumstance that can be considered during the trial.  Further, the court opined that the nature of offence and amount of culpability is serious, heinous, shocking, and unprecedented and also added thus:  "It is also evident that the main accused persons had prior information of the police raid and naturally, in the present set of facts, this information was revealed by police which not only 30 made the main accused persons alert but also provided them fullest opportunity to prepare for attack and commit such a horrendous crime in which 8 police personnel including the Circle Officer sustained gunshot injuries and died. The situation of crime was such and so sudden that the police force could not get opportunity to sustain and counter and could do nothing. The accusation against the accused-applicants is that they conspired with the main accused for the commission of the offence because of their good relationship and loyalty with main accused and also they wanted to score their personal grudge with the Circle Officer."  Lastly, to arrive at the conclusion of dismissing their bail plea, the court took into account the following:  The magnitude of the crime and the preparedness on the part of gangster Vikas Dubey and his associates; The statement of Vikas Dubey given to the IO before his death that he had prior information about the raid; The conduct of the accused-applicants before and during incident; Applicant Vinay Kumar Tiwari though leading one team but did not give any backup support nor sustained any injury and showed complete inaction; and Applicant K K Sharma deliberately avoided in participating in raid and the accusation is that he stayed and was deliberately left on police station to pass information to the gangster.

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to an accused under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act as it noted that the constables of the Railway Police Force, who witnessed the alleged recovery, search, and seizure, cannot be said to be independent witnesses.The bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed that although the search and seizure were conducted at a Railway... The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to an accused under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act as it noted that the constables of the Railway Police Force, who witnessed the alleged recovery, search, and seizure, cannot be said to be independent witnesses. The bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed that although the search and seizure were conducted at a Railway Station, there was no independent witness to the alleged recovery as the constables of the Railway Police Force cannot be said to be independent witnesses. The case in brief Essentially, the Court was dealing with the bail plea of NDPS Act accused Aditya Kumar who was booked under Section 8(C)/21/29 of NDPS Act as he was allegedly carrying 358 gms of Heroine. It was argued by his counsel that the conduct of the N.C.B. Officers in the case was suspicious as they admit that they received the information at Lucknow that the applicant was carrying Heroin from Gaya, Bihar to Bareilly through a Train, which passes through Lucknow however, they chose to apprehend the applicant at Bareilly (about 250 km from Lucknow). The Counsel further submitted that it was strange on the part of the NCB Team that they traveled the whole night from Lucknow to Bareilly to apprehend the applicant at Bareilly, which is not a natural course of conduct and it raises doubts against their story.  He has further submitted that although the alleged search and seizure was conducted at a Railway Station, which is a public place, filled with independent persons, there is no independent witness to the alleged recovery and the constables of the Railway Police Force were named as witnesses, who can't be said to be independent witnesses. Analyzing the facts of the present case, the Court found the following facts to be relevant at the stage of granting bail: -  (i) Although the search and seizure were conducted at Bareilly Railway Station there is no independent witness of the alleged recovery.  (ii) The constables of the Railway Police Force cannot be said to be independent witnesses.  (iii) Although it is mentioned in the recovery memo that the search was conducted in presence of a Gazetted Officer, however, the recovery memo does not bear the signatures of the Gazetted Officer.  (iv) The recovery memo claims that in the test and re-test of the substances conducted by the DD kit, both times it was found to be Heroin.  (v) The Intelligence Officer, N.C.B. Zonal Unit Lucknow, has stated on oath that the sample was tested by the Government Laboratory and the report states that the samples under reference answered positive test for Heroin. However, a copy of the said test report has not been filed by the NCB.  (vi) The test report filed by the applicant categorically states that the substance was not found to be Heroin but it was Morphine.  (vii) Heroin and Morphine are different and distinct substances. Against this backdrop, the Court stressed that the aforesaid facts raise doubts against the prosecution case and it gives rise to a reasonable ground for prima facie believing at this stage that the applicant may not be held guilty of the alleged offences.  In view of this, the Court granted bail to the accused Aditya Kumar and ordered him to be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two reliable sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that at commencement of trial, an accused person is entitled to a list of those documents which are not relied upon by the Investigating agency. However, the accused cannot seek that the unrelied documents themselves should be supplied to him/her. The petitioner-accused herein had approached the Court under Section 482 CrPC assailing the order of Special PMLA Judge refusing to supply the copies of documents seized by the Enforcement Directorate during raids.  The ED stated that the documents which were relied upon had already been supplied, however, the list of all such documents which were not relied upon shall be supplied upon the completion of the investigation.  The petitioner, Ashok Solomon, then argued that every document seized during investigation was required to be furnished to the accused, whether relied upon or not by the prosecution. He referred to Re: To Issue Certain Guidelines Regarding Inadequacies and Deficiencies in Criminal Trials v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Others, wherein the Supreme Court had directed for adoption of the 'Draft Rules of Criminal Practice, 2021' and had provided that while furnishing the list of statements, documents and material objects under Sections 207/208 CrPC, the Magistrate was also supposed to ensure that a list of other materials (such as statements, or objects /documents seized, but not relied on) was furnished to the accused.  The Additional Solicitor General of India, on the other hand, argued that it was settled principle of law that 'an accused was entitled only to the relied upon documents and had no right to seek unrelied upon documents at the stage of framing of charges.' Reliance was placed on the decision in State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi, 2005 (1) SCC 568.  Reliance was also placed on the decision in Assistant Collector of Customs v. L.R Melwani, 1969(2) SCR 438, to contend that an accused was not entitled to documents in a case instituted upon a complaint and since the process under the PMLA was initiated upon filing of a complaint, the accused could not seek copies of the documents. "At the most, the accused was entitled only to a list of unrelied upon documents and not the documents," argued the ASG.   The single bench of Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri referred to Rule 6 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Rules and Orders and observed, "it has been so provided by the aforesaid Rules that those documents which are not relied upon by the Investigating Officer, qua them a list should be supplied to the accused person. However, there is nothing in the aforesaid Rules that the unrelied upon documents should also be supplied to the accused."  The Court further noted that the Rules were amended to the above effect following the Supreme Court's decision in Re: To Issue Certain Guidelines (supra). Accordingly, the petition was dismissed with liberty to the petitioners to move an appropriate application before the Special Judge seeking supply of "list" of any documents either relied upon or not relied upon.

The Supreme Court on Friday observed that the right against sexual harassment is vested in all persons as a part of their right to life and right to dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Court stressed that it is important that that the spirit of this right is upheld instead of rejecting sexual harassment complaints on "hyper-technical" grounds. The Court highlighted that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace(Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 which is a transformative legislation will fail to come to the aid of aggrieved persons if proceedings inquiring into sexual misconduct are invalidated on 'hyper-technical' interpretations of the applicable service rules. "It is important that courts uphold the spirit of the right against sexual harassment, which is vested in all persons as a part of their right to life and right to dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution". A Bench comprising Justices D.Y Chandrachud and A.S Bopanna further cautioned against the 'rising trend' of appellate mechanisms relating to inquiry into sexual harassment turning into a 'punishment' of sorts for aggrieved persons.  "We would also like to highlight a rising trend of invalidation of proceedings inquiring into sexual misconduct, on hyper-technical interpretations of the applicable service rules. For instance, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act 2013 penalizes several misconducts of a sexual nature and imposes a mandate on all public and private organizations to create adequate mechanisms for redressal. However, the existence of transformative legislation may not come to the aid of persons aggrieved of sexual harassment if the appellate mechanisms turn the process into a punishment." The Bench further underscored that it is important that Courts uphold the spirit of the right against sexual harassment, which is vested in all persons as a part of their right to life and right to dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. Enumerating further on the need to be mindful of power dynamics that are mired in cases of sexual harassment at workplace, the Bench further observed,  "It is also important to be mindful of the power dynamics that are mired in sexual harassment at the workplace. There are several considerations and deterrents that a subordinate aggrieved of sexual harassment has to face when they consider reporting sexual misconduct of their superior" The Court made these observations while deciding a case related to allegations of sexual conduct against a head constable of the Border Security Force(BSF). In the instant case, the complainant, a constable at the Border Security Force(BSF) had lodged a complaint against the respondent who was the head constable – his superior. The Court observed that the alleged discrepancy regarding the date of occurrence was of a minor nature since the event occurred soon after midnight and on the next day. "Deeming such a trivial aspect to be of monumental relevance, while invalidating the entirety of the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent and reinstating him to his position renders the complainant's remedy at nought. The history of legal proceedings such as these is a major factor that contributes to the deterrence that civil and criminal mechanisms pose to persons aggrieved of sexual harassment", the Bench further observed.  Accordingly, the Bench implored Courts to interpret service rules and statutory regulations governing the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice to all the parties.  The Calcutta High Court had quashed disciplinary proceedings against the respondent and had reinstated him to his initial position in the Border Security Force (BSF). Terming such an order as 'callous', the Bench further observed,  "The High Court, in this case, was not only incorrect in its interpretation of the jurisdiction of the Commandant and the obligation of the SSFC to furnish reasons under the BSF Act 1968 and Rules therein, but also demonstrated a callous attitude to the gravamen of the proceedings"  Factual Background On May 2, 2006, the complainant had accused the respondent of committing sodomy thus resulting in the conduct of an enquiry against him. It was argued that both the Single Judge and the Division bench of the High Court had taken a "hyper-technical view of the matter", and had failed to appreciate the provisions of the BSF Act, 1968 and BSF Rules, 1969, which make any disgraceful conduct of a cruel, indecent or unnatural kind, a punishable offence.  The Union of India and the BSF approached the Supreme Court challenging the High Court's judgment quashing the disciplinary proceedings against the complainant. The accused on conviction by a Security Force Court is liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment. However, while dealing with the respondent's statutory petition under Section 117, the Director-General of BSF had reduced the quantum of sentence. He was empowered to do so in accordance with the provisions of Section 48 of the BSF Act 1968.  The Court held that the charge against the respondent was fully substantiated by the evidence on record and accordingly observed,  "The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court of 18 December 2018 and of the Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court on 7 May 2009 are set aside. In consequence, the writ petition filed by the respondent shall stand dismissed." Case Title: Union of India and Ors v.

The Gujarat High Court has held that an electricity company does not require the consent of a private landowner to lay overhead high tension transmission lines and that at most, such landowner may claim compensation for any damage that may be sustained during the process.A single Bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav heavily relied on a division bench judgment in Gujarat State... The Gujarat High Court has held that an electricity company does not require the consent of a private landowner to lay overhead high tension transmission lines and that at most, such landowner may claim compensation for any damage that may be sustained during the process. A single Bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav heavily relied on a division bench judgment in Gujarat State Electricity Transmission Corporation Ltd., Vs. Ratilal Maganji Brahmbhatt which held that:  "The Electricity Act, 2003, is a progressive enactment, with a specific purpose of providing electricity to a large number of people, across the country, to promote industrial and sustainable development in all walks of life. Right of a land owner to possess and enjoy the property, though recognised as a Constitutional Right, under Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, such right has to yield to the Articles 14 and 21 respectively of the Constitution of India, which strive to achieve the Constitutional Goals, enshrined in the basic structure of the Constitution of India."  The Court was hearing a writ petition seeking installation of the 'KV Electric line' inside and underneath the final plot of the Petitioner. This was because the line passing overhead on the private land of the Petitioner had caused the value of the land to deteriorate without any consent from the Petitioner. The plot of the Petitioner has now been divided into halves and the other half has become 'redundant', it was claimed.  The High Court concluded that the Division Bench had specifically rejected similar contentions raised by individuals for passing of transmission lines through their land. The Petitioners were permitted to raise dispute regarding compensation u/s 16(4) of the Telegraph Act in accordance with law. It was held that neither the consent of the land owner was necessary nor was he required to be heard.  Reliance was also placed on Himmatbhai Vallabhbhai Patel Vs. Chief Engineer (Projects) Gujarat Energy Transmission and others, where it was held that the Company had absolute power u/s 164 of the Electricity Act to lay down the electrical lines subject to the right of the Appellant to claim compensation. "Once the power is conferred on the licencee or any other competent authority, there can be no objection to the implementation of the scheme, on the principles of natural justice or on the ground of unauthorised use of the land."  Therefore, the issue was no more res integra and the petition was dismissed.  Case No.: C/SCA/14617/2022  Case Title: PARTH KRISHNKANT PATEL v/s MANAGING DIRECTOR/ GENERAL MANAGER (LEGAL CELL)   
In a significant observation, the Rajasthan High Court (Jodhpur Bench) has held that as per Section 2(a) of the Domestic Violence Act of 2005, the definition of 'aggrieved person', would include any woman including a foreign citizen, who is subjected to domestic violence.Such a woman is very much entitled to get the protection of Section 12 of the Act of 2005 [Application to Magistrate],... In a significant observation, the Rajasthan High Court (Jodhpur Bench) has held that as per Section 2(a) of the Domestic Violence Act of 2005, the definition of 'aggrieved person', would include any woman including a foreign citizen, who is subjected to domestic violence. Such a woman is very much entitled to get the protection of Section 12 of the Act of 2005 [Application to Magistrate], the Court further ruled. Significantly, the Bench of Justice Vinit Kumar Mathur also observed that a plain reading of the Domestic Violence Act reveals that protection under the Act is extended to the persons who are temporarily resident of India, being covered under the definition of aggrieved person as per section 2 (a) of the Act of 2005. The case before the Court One Catherine Nieiddu, a Canadian citizen filed a complaint against her husband, Robarto Nieddu (petitioner before the Court) under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The petitioner preferred an application against the complaint of her wife, on the ground of maintainability of the complaint as being non-maintainable. The same was dismissed by the trial court vide order dated February 11, 2021.  The order was assailed by the petitioner by way of filing an appeal before the appellate court, and the same was also rejected by the appellate court vide order dated August 5, 2021.  Aggrieved against both the orders, the instant petition was moved before the High Court. Before the Court, it was submitted by the petitioner that the complaint of respondent No.2 i.e. before the trial court under Section 12 of the Act of 2005 was not maintainable as the petitioner and respondent No.2 are not Indian citizens and thus, are not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Act of 2005. Lastly, he submitted that since the petitioner was only a resident of India at that relevant point of time will not confer jurisdiction in the instant case. Court's order Observing that a woman of foreign origin can maintain an application under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence as such a woman would come under the purview of the definition of 'aggrieved person' as per Section 2 (a) of the Act, the Court, at the outset, observed thus: "The fact that the respondent No.2 (woman) is resident of Jodhpur for last about 25 years and after having solemnized marriage with the petitioner, the incident which is reported in the complaint also took place at Jodhpur and therefore, in view of definitions enumerated under sections 2 (a) and 12 of the Act of 2005, it is held that the application preferred by the respondent No.2 before the trial court is maintainable" Importantly, referring to Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the Court remarked that even Article 21 of the Constitution of India extends the benefit of protection not only to every citizen of the country, but also to a "person" who may not be a citizen of the Country.  "Article 21 states that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to a procedure established by law. Therefore, looked at from that angle, a person aggrieved i.e. respondent No.2 is very much entitled to get protection of section 12 of the Act of 2005," the Court noted as it dismissed the petition.

The Supreme Court set aside the conviction of a man accused in a POCSO case after noticing that he had married the prosecutrix and had two children."This Court cannot shut its eyes to the ground reality and disturb the happy family life of the appellant and the prosecutrix.

The Supreme Court set aside the conviction of a man accused in a POCSO case after noticing that he had married the prosecutrix and had two children. "This Court cannot shut its eyes to the ground reality and disturb the happy family life of the appellant and the prosecutrix. We have been informed about the custom in Tamilnadu of the marriage of a girl with the maternal uncle.", the bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and B R Gavai observed while rejecting the objection raised by the State which contended that the marriage might be only for the purpose of escaping punishment. The accused, who is the maternal uncle of the prosecutrix, was convicted under Sections 5(j)(ii)read with Section 6, 5(I) read with Section 6 and 5(n) read with Section 6 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.  He was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years. The Madras High Court upheld the conviction and sentence. Before the Apex Court, the appellant submitted that allegation against him was that he had physical relations with the prosecutrix on the promise of marrying her and that he married the prosecutrix and they have two children.  The court also noticed the statement of the prosecutrix in which she stated that she has two children and they are being taken care of by the appellant and she is leading a happy married life. The State opposed the appeal and submitted that the prosecutrix was aged 14 years on the date of the offence and gave birth to the first child when she was 15 years and the second child was born when she was 17 years and the marriage between the accused and the prosecutrix is not legal. While allowing the appeal, the bench observed: In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the considered view that the conviction and sentence of the appellant who is maternal uncle of the prosecutrix deserves to be set aside in view of the subsequent events that have been brought to the notice of this Court. This Court cannot shut its eyes to the ground reality and disturb the happy family life of the appellant and the prosecutrix. We have been informed about the custom in Tamilnadu of the marriage of a girl with the maternal uncle. The bench clarified that if the accused-appellant does not take proper care of the prosecutrix, she or the State on behalf of the prosecutrix can move for modification of this Order.

The Allahabad High Court recently set aside a show cause notice sent after pre-mediation as the Court noted that the respondent (a government authority) had already made up their mind and had expressed their decision in the notice while issuing the same to the petitioner (M/S Bcits Pvt.

The Allahabad High Court recently set aside a show cause notice sent after pre-mediation as the Court noted that the respondent (a government authority) had already made up their mind and had expressed their decision in the notice while issuing the same to the petitioner (M/S Bcits Pvt. Ltd.). "...even if the petitioner offers its explanation, it would be an empty formality and a futile exercise. Fairness demanded that the respondent should have taken care to keep their mind open to the issues while seeking an explanation," remarked the bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and Justice Dinesh Pathak. Essentially, the petitioner-Company was given a contract of "Door to Door Meter Reading, Bill Generation and Serving through SBM/Mobile App/Other Suitable Means with Downloading" by the respondent-Corporation in 2018. In June 2020 and in August 2021, the petitioner was issued a notice threatening to blacklist it on account of alleged irregularities on its part. However, both the notices were later on, dropped. However, another notice was issued in August 2021 with the same allegations threatening the petitioner company to blacklist it. The Petitioner comapny gave a reply to this notice, however, the explanation was not accepted and the respondent arrived at a definite finding that the alleged irregularities and breaches committed by the Company had resulted in tarnishing the image of the respondent-Corporation. Accordingly, the petitioner company was issued with a show cause notice to come forward and explain as why it should not be blacklisted/debarred for a period of two years. Challenging this notice, the petitioner company moved to the High Court stating that since the notice was issued after pre-meditation and thus, issuing notice and seeking explanation would not serve any purpose as the respondent/corporation that issued the notice had already made up its mind. Agreeing with this contention of the petitioner-company, the Court noted that the respondent corporation had already expressed its mind that the explanation offered by the petitioner company was unsatisfactory and that the petitioner company was guilty of the charges levelled against it.  In the above backdrop, the Court noted that now, even if the petitioner offers its explanation, it would be an empty formality and a futile exercise. Further, noting that the respondent-Corporation had already made up its mind that the explanation was not worthy of acceptance, therefore, the notice can't be said to be a show cause notice as the decision had already been taken.  Accordingly, the Court quashed the impugned notice leaving it open to the respondent corporation to issue a fresh notice in accordance with the law, if so advised. Senior Advocate Prashant Chandra assisted by Advocate Kartikey Dubey appeared for the petitioner company. Case title - M/S Bcits Pvt. Ltd. v. Purvanchal Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Ltd.

The Karnataka High Court has issued directions to be followed by magistrate courts for disposal of applications being made by an aggrieved person under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, within 60 days from the date of its filing. A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna said “The law Courts which exist to remedy the wrong when it is brought to its notice has to act swiftly, as it is trite that, actus curiae neminem gravabit that the act of Court should prejudice no person. If an act of the Court should not prejudice any person; the Court should not permit any procrastination of the proceedings before it.”   It added “A woman, who is a victim of domestic violence, knocking at the doors of the Magistrate, under the Act seeking maintenance or shelter, such grievance, will have to be addressed with immediacy. It is for this reason that the statute mandates that such applications have to be disposed of within 60 days in terms of sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act. The mandate is unequivocal as sub-section (5) mandates that the Magistrate shall endeavour to dispose of every application; every application would mean each and every, not a few or more.”   Further it opined “If the delay takes away the very soul of the enactment, such delay would definitely deny justice. It is, therefore, often said that “justice delayed is justice denied”.  Before issuing the directions the bench expressed “It becomes necessary for this Court to direct the Magistrates, to henceforth decide the applications filed by the aggrieved persons within the time frame.”  Following directions have been issued by the court:   (a) Applications filed along with the application under Section 12 be it under Section 18, 19 or 20 of the Act, the concerned Court shall decide those applications filed along with the petition under Section 12 within 60 days from the date of its filing. (b) The husband shall be granted 4 weeks time to file his assets and liabilities statement for a decision on an application filed under Section 20 of the Act. If it is not filed within the time frame, the concerned Court shall accept the application filed by the wife/aggrieved person and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.  (c) Objections if any, to the application/s filed by the aggrieved person under Sections 18 and 19 by the opposite party, shall be filed within 4 weeks from the date of receipt of notice, failing which, the Court concerned will be at liberty to pass appropriate orders in accordance with law. (d) To achieve the said timeline, the concerned Court shall draw up and regulate its procedure in terms of its inherent power under Section 28(2) of the Act.  The bench said “The concerned Court shall strictly adhere to what is indicated hereinabove and its deviation can only be for reasons to be recorded in writing while passing orders on the applications.”  The bench remarked “Adherence to the aforesaid timeline would be of paramount importance, as remedy under Section 12 to an aggrieved person is imperative. Therefore, timely disposal of such applications are also imperative as Section 12 is the salt of the statute; if by delay the salt would lose its savour; the statute would lose its flavour.”  The directions were given while allowing a petition filed by one Kavita M, who in 2018 instituted proceedings under the Act invoking Section 12, and also filed several other applications under Section 23 of the Act seeking non-alienation, encumbrance of schedule property, seeking alternative accommodation, monetary relief, ex-parte maintenance and return of valuable articles. The learned Magistrate in terms of his order dated 29-10-2018 rejected the application for non-alienation or encumbering the schedule property. Except that order, the learned Magistrate did not pass any order on any other applications.  The petitioner approached the court seeking directions to the magistrate court to dispose of the applications filed by her.  Findings:  The bench referred the objects and reason behind promulgating the act, various provisions contained in the act and said “Sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Section 12 permit an aggrieved person to seek relief or compensation or damages for injuries caused by the acts of domestic violence committed by the respondent.”  It added “Sub-section (5) thereof mandates that the Magistrate shall endeavour to dispose of every application made under subsection (1) within 60 days of its first hearing which would mean that when an aggrieved person approaches the learned Magistrate seeking one or more reliefs under the Act, it is mandatory that the Magistrate shall dispose of every, application made under subsection (1) within 60 days from the date of its first hearing.”  On going through the records the bench said “Applications seeking alternative accommodation, monetary relief and ex-parte interim maintenance were all pending consideration and they are pending consideration even as on date, despite the passage of 52 months after their filing.”  Observing that “If an application is filed by the aggrieved person under sub-section (1) of Section 12 and applications are filed under Sections 18, 19 and 20 they have to be decided within the time frame stipulated under sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, as sub-section (5) of Section 12 mandates that any application filed before the learned Magistrate while filing an application under Section 12 should be decided by the Magistrate within 60 days from the date of its filing.”  The bench said “Section 12 therefore becomes the heart and soul of the entire Act and applications under Sections 19 & 20 are clearly maintainable along with an application under Section 12. Therefore, those applications would also be bound by the time limit stipulated under Section 12.”  Following which it held “Section 23 of the Act empowers the learned Magistrate to grant of interim and ex-parte orders in any application under Sections 18, 19, 20 and 21 or even 22 against the respondent, granting interim relief in terms of the application/s so filed cannot be after an eon, it has to be granted anon. Therefore, there is no warrant for any Magistrate to await for the procedure as stipulated under the CrPC to get concluded, and then grant the relief that is sought in the application.”  It added “It defeats the very life blood of the Act.”  Finally it said “If Section 12 is the one under which applications are filed before the concerned Court, sub-section (5) of Section 12 mandates disposal within 60 days.”  Allowing the petition the bench directed the concerned court to dispose of the applications as sought for in the prayer within four weeks. The parties to the lis shall cooperate with the Court to pass appropriate orders on the applications, failing which, the Court should be at liberty to pass ex-parte orders in terms of Section 23 of the Act.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench recently refused to pass an order of child custody in favour of the Appellant-mother, upon noting that the children themselves had expressed their inclination to reside with their father. "It is true that both of them are minor, however, the age of 16 years is not such an age where a child, given a choice, is not able to make up his or her mind as to his or her inclination to reside with either of the parents. In the present case, this choice has been exercised in favour of the father and thus, despite agreeing with the contentions of the appellant/petitioner regarding the legality of the impugned order, the learned Writ Court has not found it to be appropriate to hand over the custody of the children to the appellant/petitioner/wife," division bench of Justice Subodh Abhyankar and Justice Satyendra Kumar Singh observed. The Bench was essentially dealing with a writ appeal preferred by the Appellant against the order of the Writ Court, whereby it quashed the order of Sub-Divisional Magistrate granting custody of children to the father (respondent no. 4), however, did not explicitly grant custody of the children to her.  The Court noted that ordinarily, when an impugned order is set aside by a higher authority, the status quo, prior to the date of impugned order is restored. However, the present case was not in respect of the any immovable or movable property or any live stock. It pertained to the lives of two human beings, who had expressed their inclinations. "It is nobody's case that the respondent No.4 (father) is in any manner incompetent or is having such vices which may prejudice the interest of the children in his company. In the considered opinion of this court, had it been a case where the father was not found fit to provide healthy environment to the children's upbringing, this court would certainly have interfered in the impugned order and the choice made by the children, but there are no such facts brought on record by the appellant," the Court ordered. Facts of the case were that the Appellant had twin sons with her husband, who were around 16 years old. Following a matrimonial dispute, the husband filed before an application SDM concerned, under Section 97 of CrPC, seeking custody of children. The SDM allowed the application and the custody of the children was handed over to the respondent no. 4.  The aforesaid order was challenged by the Appellant/wife before the High Court, whereby the single bench partly allowed the appeal and quashed the order of SDM. It further directed the husband to not force the children to live with him, and that the children were free to live with their mother.  The Appellant argued that despite the petition being allowed by the Writ Court and the impugned order being quashed, she got no relief as the custody of her sons were not given to her explicitly. She prayed for the order to be modified, accordingly to the extent that the custody of the children be handed over to her from the husband.  Per contra, the husband submitted that no interference was called for as the single bench of the Court had passed the order after having an interaction with the children, who had expressed their willingness to reside with their father only. Thus, he argued that the appeal was liable to be dismissed.  Considering the contentions of the parties and the material on record, the Court noted that since the children themselves chose to live with their father, thus, the Writ Court rightly did not find it to be appropriate to hand over the custody of the children to her.  With the aforesaid observations, the Court refused to interfere with the order of the Writ Court and the appeal was accordingly dismissed.

While upholding the conviction of a man who raped a minor girl in the year 2011, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court today remarked that in the Indian setting, the refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration, as a rule, is adding insult to injury.The bench of Justice Rajnesh Oswal and Justice Mohan Lal also observed that in rape cases,... While upholding the conviction of a man who raped a minor girl in the year 2011, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court today remarked that in the Indian setting, the refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration, as a rule, is adding insult to injury. The bench of Justice Rajnesh Oswal and Justice Mohan Lal also observed that in rape cases, the victim loses her face, and her value as a person. The Court further emphasized that in our conservative society, a woman and more so a young unmarried woman will not put her reputation in peril by falsely alleging forcible sexual assault. The case in brief  The appellant/convict had been held guilty, convicted, and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 20 years for commission of offence punishable u/s 376 RPC and was further sentenced to simple imprisonment for a period of 2 years for commission of offence punishable u/s 506 RPC. The appellant challenged the conviction order on the ground that the prosecutrix had filed an application for registration of FIR after the lapse of more than 08 months from the date of the incident, there has been a delay in the registration of FIR which has remained unexplained It was also argued that the prosecutrix had never mentioned in her statement recorded before the trial court that the appellant/convict had ever committed rape upon her, and that she had only stated that the appellant/convict committed "Beparadgi" upon her, which by no stretch of imagination can be construed as rape. Further, the accused also questioned the claim of the victim about being a minor. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that the delay in lodging FIR in cases under Section 376 IPC would depend upon the facts of each case, regard being had to the trauma suffered by the prosecutrix and various other factors such as fear of social stigma. "In the case in hand, FIR has been lodged on 04-12-2011 after a laps of about 8 months from the date of occurrence i.e. 04-04-2011. It is admitted case of the prosecution that there is a delay of about 8 months in lodging the FIR. The prosecutrix has satisfactorily explained the delay that she was under the threat of being killed by appellant/convict and therefore when her father came at home from Kashmir and enquired from her regarding her putting on flesh, she told her father that she is having child of accused in her womb," the Court remarked as it noted that the delay in the lodging of the FIR was explained by the victim. Further, the Court stressed that the evidence of the prosecutrix does not necessarily need corroboration for sustaining the conviction of the accused where the prosecutrix had no motive to falsely implicate the accused risking her own reputation and that a young unmarried woman will not put her reputation in peril by alleging falsely about forcible sexual assault. Against this backdrop, the Court held that the prosecutrix who is minor had no motive to falsely implicate the appellant/accused risking her own reputation in peril by alleging falsely about forcible sexual assault by the appellant. Adverting to the second argument of the accused, the Court observed that the word "bepardagi" is Urdu vernacular word and it clearly means to undress or make someone nude.  "The prosecutrix has testified the correctness of the contents of her statement recorded u/s 164-A Cr.pc before Judicial Magistrate during the course of investigation which clearly establishes/proves that she was subjected to the act of forcible sexual intercourse/rape by appellant/accused...Arguments advanced by Ld. Counsel for appellant/convict that the word "bepardagi" does not mean rape and the prosecutrix nowhere has stated before the trial court that she was subjected to forcible sexual intercourse/rape, in view of the cogent, credible and sterling quality of evidence led by the prosecutrix, are legally unsustainable, repelled, rejected and discarded." the Court further remarked. Taking into account the evidence on record, the Court came to the conclusion that the date of birth of the prosecutrix was 12-12-1995 and at the time of occurrence on 04.04.2011 her date of birth when calculated comes to 15 years and about 04 months, and therefore, the prosecutrix/victim (PW-3) at the time of occurrence on 04.04.2011 was minor and under 16 years of age. Lastly, regarding the quantum of sentence, the Court took into consideration the mitigating circumstances projected by the appellant/convict (34 years of age, married man), and while upholding the conviction, modified the sentence of 20 years rigorous imprisonment imposed upon the appellant/convict to a minimum sentence of 7 years (RI) for the commission of offence of rape u/s 376 RPC without altering the fine component of Rs. 50000/-.  However, the sentence imposed by the trial court for commission of offence u/s 506 RPC for 2 years simple imprisonment and fine component shall remain unaltered, the Court ordered.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted bail to one Fuzail who has been accused of selling sugarcane juice which was adulterated with beef.  The bench of Justice Deepak Verma granted him bail keeping in view the nature of offence, evidence, and complicity of the accused and the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Satender Kumar Antil vs Central Bureau Of Investigation |  (SC) 577.  Accused Fuzail, booked under Sections 323, 504, 295-A I.P.C. and Section 3, 5 of U.P. Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955, had moved the High Court seeking bail on the ground that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case due to ulterior motive.  It was submitted by his counsel Hasan Parvez that the accused is engaged in selling sugarcane juice and he was implicated in the case by the informant making a concocted story after a dispute arose between the parties regarding the payment of money.   It was also argued that there is no FSL report of the alleged incident, which may prove the prosecution story, hence, no offence under the alleged sections is made out and he is languishing in jail since November 30, 2022.   Against this backdrop, noting that the accused had made a case for bail, the Court granted him relief on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.

The Bombay High Court has imposed costs of Rs. 2 lakh on Adani Electricity Limited payable to Mumbai Electric Workers' Union while dismissing a petition in which the company claimed it was no covered under Maharashtra Industrial Relations Act, 1946 (MIR Act).  A division bench of Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice MS Karnik observed that it was so "unambiguously clear" that the company was covered under the act that neither did BSES Ltd or Reliance Energy Ltd, that were in charge before Adani ever raise this as an issue.  The petition is an effort to tire out members of the Union, the HC noted.  " (The) present effort on the part of the petitioning company, as has rightly been contended by Mr. Bukhari (Union' lawyer), is an effort to tire out the members of the Union in their battle with the petitioning company," the court observed.   Adani, involved in the generation and supply of electricity, was seeking all orders passed by the industrial tribunal against it after August 2019, be struck down. The dispute between Adani and its employees is with regard to wages and age of retirement, in employment agreements.   However, the HC did not comment on the original dispute as the question raised was only with regard to the industrial tribunal jurisdiction to hear the matter.   The company claimed that provisions of the Maharashtra Industrial Relations Act, 1946 (MIR Act), were not applicable to it since it is engaged in generation and supply of electricity in Mumbai and Mira-Bhayandar. It has a coal-fired thermal power plant at Dahanu in Palghar.   Before August 29, 2018, the business was owned and operate by the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited. It was later handled by Reliance Energy Limited and subsequently by Reliance Infrastructure Limited. Adani took over in August 29, 2018.   The MIR Act regulates relations of employers and employees, to make provision for settlement of industrial disputes and to provide for certain other purposes. It has succeeded the Maharashtra Industrial Disputes Act, 1938.   Senior Advocate AV Bukhari, for the union, argued that the petition was filed belatedly and that the company and its predecessor companies participated in the proceedings before the tribunal without raising any issues. He contended that the petition has been filed "to scuttle all efforts under the provisions of the MIR Act to ensure and/or secure industrial peace and harmony".  However, JP Cama, Adani's said they were not covered under the MIR Act therefore the industrial tribunal orders were without jurisdiction. The Act and notifications issued would apply to companies which are involved only in supply of the electricity.   The bench said that the company was covered under provisions of the MIR Act and the Industrial tribunal did have the jurisdiction to adjudicate references made to it and the matters must be decided without granting unnecessary adjournments.   "we are of the firm view that the provisions of the notifications issued under the MIR Act were so unambiguously clear that at no time in the past either BSES Ltd. or M/s. Reliance Energy Limited or M/s. Reliance Infrastructure Limited ever chose to raise a point in course of proceedings initiated under the MIR Act that the provisions thereof did not apply…"   Significantly, the court said that HC's can't stall proceedings before the tribunal on mere asking of an employer and a prima facie case ought to have been made out for the court to exercise its jurisdiction.   "..neither the High Courts ought to entertain writ petitions at the instance of employers on the mere asking nor should it pass interim orders stalling the proceedings before the Tribunal for no better reason than that a prima facie case has been set up without being concerned about the balance of convenience, the public interest and a host of other consideration."  
The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld an eviction order wherein the daughter-in-law was directed to vacate the residence belonging to her father-in-law after noting that she is a medical practitioner and is thus not in a poor financial condition. Justice Rajasekhar Mantha observed, "The applicant, Swati Das, is admittedly a medical practitioner. She is neither destitute... The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld an eviction order wherein the daughter-in-law was directed to vacate the residence belonging to her father-in-law after noting that she is a medical practitioner and is thus not in a poor financial condition.  Justice Rajasekhar Mantha observed,  "The applicant, Swati Das, is admittedly a medical practitioner. She is neither destitute nor in a poor economic or financial condition, and there is no averment to that effect in the application. Apart from the questions of law raised by the applicant daughter-in-law, she has not able to make out any case for restoration with possession of her father-in-law's house." The Court noted that the applicant had never claimed any right of residence or share of the household against the father-in-law or her husband under the provisions of the the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. It was also noted that the applicant had not asserted any domestic violence or torture perpetrated by either her father-in-law or her husband. Thus, the Court opined that it can exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of this court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to protect the life and liberty of the senior citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution.  "In respect of a discomfort expressed by a senior citizen towards his children, a single complaint is good enough evidence. Further, there are no disputed questions of fact in the instant case i.e., that the house admittedly belongs to the father of the writ petitioner", the Court underscored further.  It was further observed that the Writ Court under Article 226 has jurisdiction to evict sons and daughters-in-law from the residence of senior citizens, if the latter is uncomfortable or inconvenienced by the presence of any of the former. The applicant and her ex-husband are at best licensees in the house of the father-in-law, it was stated further.  Reliance was placed on the Calcutta High Court decision in Ramapada Basak v. State of West Bengal& Ors wherein it had been held that that children and their spouses living in the senior citizen's house are at best "licensees" and that the said license comes to an end once the senior citizens are not comfortable with their children and their families. During the proceedings, the applicant daughter-in-law had sought the recall of the impugned eviction order dated December 9, 2021 on the ground that she did not receive notice of the writ petition. She had argued that a copy of the writ petition was not supplied to her and that someone else- possibly someone on behalf of the petitioner had collected the said writ petition.  Dismissing such a contention, the Court observed,  "The Court however, is sufficiently satisfied with the evidence forwarded by the postal authorities, as also the reasons provided in the affidavit filed. Satisfactory reasons have been provided for absence/lack of a physical pay-slip of delivery, as well as for the lack of a signature in the electronic device used by the postman, wherein, as per the postman, the lady of the house who received the package had refused to sign citing COVID conditions. It therefore cannot be said that there is no proof of delivery of the writ petition to Swati Das, the applicant." Case Title: Debaki Nandan Maiti v. The State of West Bengal and Ors.

The Madras High Court on Friday ruled in favour of original jurisdiction of High Court for hearing child custody and guardianship cases in a 3:2 majority decision The five judge bench comprising of Justice PN Prakash, Justice R Mahadevan, Justice M Sunder, Justice Anand Venkatesh and Justice AA Nakkiran was constituted following reference by a three judge bench to answer the following questions:  (i) Whether the jurisdiction of the High Court, on its Original Side, over matters of child custody and guardianship is ousted, in view of the provisions of Explanation (g) to Section 7(1) read with Sections 8 and 20 of the Family Courts Act, 1984?  (ii) Whether the decision of a Full Bench of this Court in Mary Thomas Vs. Dr K.E.Thomas (AIR 1990 Madras 100) is still good law? Justice R Mahadevan, Justice M Sunder and Justice AA Nakkiran delivered the majority judgment and held that the jurisdiction of the High Court on original side is not ousted in view of explanation (g) to Section 7(1) of the Family Courts Act. They further observed that the judgement in Mary Thomas continued to be a good law. Justice PN Prakash and Justice Anand Venkatesh however ruled against original jurisdiction of High Court and held that Mary Thomas was not a good law.  During hearing, the petitioners supported the concurrent jurisdiction of the High Court and submitted that the decision in Mary Thomas was a good law. It was submitted that the word "District Court" does not have one meaning and its meaning depends upon each act.   The petitioners had further submitted that the Madras High Court had letter patent jurisdiction and this jurisdiction could not be taken away impliedly. Thus, even though Section 8 of the Family Courts act was an ouster of jurisdiction, it did not oust the jurisdiction of the High Court. The petitioners also advocated for a harmonious construction and submitted that the jurisdiction of the High Court, that was granted through a specific legislature (Letters Patent) could not be taken away by a general legislation (Family Courts Act).  The respondents, arguing for ouster of High Court's jurisdiction submitted that the High Court's power under the Letters Patent was subject to legislative enactments. Thus if there was a law that was enacted by the Parliament or the Legislature providing something different from that provided in the Letters Patent, the same shall have authority over the Letter Patent, as provided under Clause 44 (which would prevail over Clause 17).  The respondents also submitted that matrimonial jurisdiction was not an original jurisdiction of the court. An exclusive court under the act and concurrent jurisdiction of the High Court together would not be proper. The respondents further submitted that Family Courts Act being an exclusive legislation, the parliamentary intent was to give powers to the High Court alone  Case Title: S. Annapoorni v.

While allowing the plea filed by the petitioner, the single bench of Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur held that the decision of the State seeking to convert the school in question from a Hindi medium to an English Medium school with immediate effect, is fortiori, violative of Article 19(1)(a) and 14 of the Constitution.

While allowing the plea filed by the petitioner, the single bench of Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur held that the decision of the State seeking to convert the school in question from a Hindi medium to an English Medium school with immediate effect, is fortiori, violative of Article 19(1)(a) and 14 of the Constitution.  Justice Dinesh Mehta held that English, as a medium of instruction, cannot be thrusted upon a child even by a legislation enacted by the State Government, much less by a policy decision". The present petition, filed by the School Development Management Committee of Shri Hari Singh Senior Secondary School, Pilwa Panchayat Samiti Dechu, Jodhpur, challenging the decisions of Sept 2021 taken by the state government which converted petitioners' Hindi Medium school to an English Medium School - Mahatma Gandhi Government School (English Medium). From the factual matrix ,the following 5 questions emerged and the court answered accordingly: (i) Whether Article 21A of the Constitution of India which guarantees a right to education, also guarantees right to receive education in mother tongue or home language? Relying on the Supreme Court's case of State of Karnataka & Anr. Vs. Associated Management of English Medium Primary & Secondary Schools & Ors. (2014) 9 SCC 485, the court ruled that since Article 21A of the Constitution is tethered with the words "in such manner, as the State, may, by law determine", therefore, the State may by law provide the medium and manner to provide such free education, which in a given case can be Hindi, English or even regional dialect - the mother tongue of the child. No child or parent can claim it as a matter of right, that he/his ward should be instructed in a particular language or the mother tongue only. (ii) Whether right to get education in mother tongue or Hindi is a fundamental right? While examining the above ruling of State of Karnataka, wherein the Supreme Court also held that the right to have education in mother tongue or in a particular medium is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a), the single bench in this instant case, pointed out that such right has reasonable restriction under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. The court added that the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) is only subject to reasonable restrictions by law to be enacted by the State and through these, it can prescribe a medium of instruction considering the overall development of the child & socio-economic factors. The court answered that the State's policy decision cannot whittle down the fundamental right of a child to be taught in a particular medium, which is assured rather protected by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. (iii) Whether the policy decision of the State converting the school in question to Mahatma Gandhi English Medium School is in conflict with the provisions of section 20, 21, 22 and 29(2)(f) of the Act of 2009? The court pursued the Act of 2009 and the Rajasthan Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011 ("Rules"), which authorised the School Management Committee to perform various functions including the preparation of school development plan, enrollment, attendance etc. However, the Court was unable to conclude that prescription of medium of instruction is a decision to be taken by the School Management Committee, as a part of school development plan. The court observed that preparing a school development plan cannot be misconstrued to mean the prescription of syllabus and medium of instructions. It has to be done by the experts in the field of education/child education. (iv) Whether the consent of School Development Management Committee (SDMC) is necessary before converting a Hindi medium school to an English medium school? The court opined that on the conjoint reading of section 21 and 22 of the Act of 2009 and Rule 3 and 22 of the Rules of 2011, it can be observed that it is not within the domain of the SDMC to decide as to what language pupil of the school will be instructed. The medium of instruction is to be determined by the Appropriate Authority or Rajasthan School Education Council, added the court. Rule 3(2) of 2011 thereof provides that parent/guardian of every child studying in the School will be a member of the SDMC. However, In this case, the impugned administrative decision of abruptly converting a Hindi medium school to an English medium was upheld, without the wishes and consent of the SDMC. The court remarked that changing the medium of instruction of a school which houses 601 rural students, out of which 303 are girls and a major part of them hail from lower strata, including SC, ST, OBC and minorities cannot be countenanced. The same is violative of their constitutional rights and is likely to affect their emotional quotient as well. The court ruled, "Merely because the State has taken a stand that in view of the demand of more English medium schools, one English medium school in all villages having the population of more than 5000 should be established, the opinion of the SDMC cannot be given a go bye – altogether. The argument that there is no requirement of consent of the SDMC, for the school in question, as it is founded; funded; maintained and controlled by the State, cannot be accepted." The court, while quashing the state's decision, remarked, "The defence, which the State has taken that the children of this school will be accommodated in nearby schools, cannot be accepted as a valid justification for uprooting 601 saplings (students) from the present school to be implanted in nearby schools, even if they are within the vicinity of 2 kms. Such action in no case can be taken in the middle of academic session 2011-22." (v) Who can decide or change the medium of instruction in elementary level schools? As per court, Section 29 of the RTE Act specifically provides that curriculum and evaluation procedure shall be laid down by the Academic Authority. Rule 22 of Rules, 2011, which have been framed in exercise of powers available to the State under section 38 of the RTE Act is the relevant provision, which provides for and speaks of an Academic Authority. The court opined that since the medium of instruction is to be determined by the Academic Authority, which in the State of Rajasthan is Rajasthan School Education Council, the School Management Committee, cannot decide the medium of instruction may it be Hindi or English. The court observed, "Section 29(2)(f) of the Act of 2009 and the National Education Policy, 2020 prescribes that the medium of education or instruction till elementary level shall be in mother tongue. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the same cannot be changed to English medium at least by an administrative decision. It further added, "The conversion of the school in question to English medium is, therefore, clearly contrary to the provisions of section 21, 22, 29(1) and 29(2)(f) of the RTE Act." In addition to this, the Single Bench relied on the case of Dr. Srinivas Guntupalli Vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.; Writ Petition (PIL) No.183/2019. wherein Andhra Government had issued notification which provided that all Government schools from Grade - I to VIII for the academic session 2020-21 and Grade – IX & X for the academic session 2021-2022 be converted to English medium schools. When said decision came to judicial scrutiny, the Andhra Pradesh High Court quashed the Government notification holding, inter-alia, that the same is violative of Article 21A and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, apart from being in contravention of provisions of section 29(2) of the Right to Education Act, 2009 and section 7(3) and 7(4) of the Act of Andhra Pradesh Right to Education Act, 1982. The petitioner pointed out that the school comprises various children below 14 years. He argued that consequent to the impugned decision of the State, the students of the school are compelled to take admission in other schools that too in the midst of their academic session. Such action/order of the State Government is violative of the rights of the petitioners and students/parents guaranteed under Article 21A of the Constitution. The petitioner further submitted that if the State really wants to bring in more English medium schools or Mahatma Gandhi Schools, it is incumbent upon it to create infrastructure and provide for budget as had been done in the operational guidelines of 2014-15, in which a decision to establish Swami Vivekanand Government Model School was taken by the State Government, however by setting apart separate budget for the same. On the other hand, the respondents argued that the right of primary education has been guaranteed by Article 21A of the Constitution of India, but the same is not an absolute right. Imparting education in English can by no stretch of imagination be said to be violation of right guaranteed under Article 21A of the Constitution of India.

The Delhi High Court has ruled that the mere fact that the authority granting sanction for prosecution under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) is located in the national capital, will not give the court the jurisdiction to quash the order especially when all the ingredients, events and proceedings relating to the case are taking place in another jurisdiction.  A division of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Anish Dayal made the observation while dismissing the plea moved by former Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze for quashing of the order granting sanction to prosecute him under UAPA in theAntilia bomb scare case.  Rejecting the plea for lack of territorial jurisdiction, the court said: "Having considered the facts and circumstances of the matter and the obvious forum conveniens for the petitioner, being a resident of Mumbai, seeking relief relating to proceedings underway in Mumbai, the special courts and authorities investigating and adjudicating the matter located in Mumbai, this Court finds no reason to clothe itself with territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate the relief sought in this petition" It noted that the alleged offence, subsequent complaint, probe, FIRs, filing of the chargesheet and all proceedings in the case, including Waze's custody, had taken place in Mumbai. "In the considered opinion of this Court the mere fact that the authority which awards sanction for prosecution under UAPA is located in Delhi, will not give this Court the jurisdiction to grant relief to quash that order sans the fact that all possible ingredients, events and proceedings in relation to the said matter are taking place in Mumbai," said the court The court thus agreed with the argument made by Deputy Solicitor General SV Raju that the trial court in Mumbai, which had taken the cognizance of the chargesheet, would be competent to adjudicate upon the challenge to the sanctioning order.  As the plea also sought striking down of Section 15(1) of the UAPA - which defines the 'terrorist act' under the law, the court observed that there was no reason as to why the said prayer should be severed and considered in isolation. The case pertains to the recovery of 20 gelatine sticks (explosives) and a threat note in a Mahindra Scorpio vehicle near business tycoon Mukesh Ambani's house last year and the subsequent murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran. Waze was arrested in the case on March 13. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), Waze has also accused Waze of extorting money from bar and orchestra owners. The agency has claimed that the motive behind Waze's alleged crime was to re-establish himself as a "super cop" to regain the lost glory following his reinstatement in the Mumbai Police force in 2020, after 16 years. The NIA has accused Waze and 9 others under Sections 302(murder), 120B (conspiracy), 201 (destruction of evidence), 364 (kidnapping), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of the IPC and Sections 16 (punishment for a terrorist Act), 18(punishment for conspiracy) & 20 (punishment for being a member of a terrorist gang) of UAPA.

The matter has been posted for final hearing on September 20.The Madhya Pradesh High Court has refused to vacate a stay order on an ordinance seeking to increase the reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from 14 per cent to 27 per cent in the State.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has refused to vacate a stay order on an ordinance seeking to increase the reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from 14 per cent to 27 per cent in the State. The state government had moved the Court seeking to vacate the stay which affects the admission to post graduate medical courses. On hearing both the parties, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice V K Shukla posted the matter opposing the Ordinance to September 20 for final hearing. Background  On March 19, 2019, the  the Madhya Pradesh Public Service (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994 was promulgated, increasing the reservation of the OBC category from 14% to 27%. Subsequently, the Ordinance was repealed and replaced with the Madhya Pradesh Public Service (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Amendment Act, 2019, amending Section 4(a) and (b) of the 1994 Act giving effect to the increased per cent of reservation for the OBC category. The present petition was originally filed challenging the Ordinance; however, after the grant of interim relief, the amendment came and thus, the petition challenges the validity of the 2019 Amendment. It was the petitioner's case that if the increased 27% is to be considered, the total reservation will go up to 63%, which is constitutionally impermissible. Ordering a stay on the Ordinance, the Court directed that more than 14% of reservations for the OBC category in admission should not be made. Several other petitions were also filed challenging the same Ordinance and were thus linked with the main petition. The same order mechanically followed in all the other petitions. Thereby by an order dated January 28, 2020, it was directed that while it is open for the Public Service Commissions to continue with the selection process, the same shall not be finalized, and no appointment shall be made without prior permission of the High Court. On the grounds of parity, the Court ordered that the same order shall mutatis mutandis apply other similarly situated petitions. However, the Court clarified that the interim order would not be applicable regarding 10% reservation carved out for the economically weaker sections in the General Category as per the 103rd Amendment Act, 2019. The State has filed the present application for the vacation of the said interim reliefs and the dismissal of the petition. Submissions & Findings Solicitor General of India, Mr Tushar Mehta and Advocate General Mr Purushaindra Kaurav argued on behalf of the State seeking to vacate the said interim orders arguing that there is always a presumption concerning the constitutional validity of an enactment. It was argued that until and unless the enactment is declared ultra vires of the Constitution of India, its effect and operation cannot stay. Mr Mehta also argued that the order staying the effect of the said Ordinance does not record any reasons in support of the same. He submitted that the order dated January 31 2020, has been passed on the suggestion given by the Advocate General. He further proposed that the Court may modify the stay orders in the terms that the appointments to the extent of the increased quota of reservation in favour of the OBC may remain subject to the outcome of the petitions. Advocate Aditya Sanghi, the lead counsel for the petitioners, opposed the application, arguing that though the reasons have not been elaborated upon in the orders, the Court had heard the matter at quite some length before passing the orders. Moreover, they argued that Article 226(3) could not be invoked at this stage. He prayed before the Court to hear and decide the matter finally. 
Observing that a man couldn't claim irretrievable breakdown of his marriage after falsely accusing his wife being an "HIV patient" and refusing to co-habit with her, the Bombay High Court refused to grant the man divorce.  A division bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sharmila Deshmukh dismissed an artist's appeal from 2011 against a Family Court order refusing divorce under Section 13 (1)(i-a) (i-b) and (v) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.   "Petitioner cannot be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. In spite of the report… which shows the test result as HIV DNA "not detected", the Petitioner has refused to co-habit with the Respondent and defamed the Respondent (wife) in the society by informing relatives and friends that the Respondent (wife) has tested positive."  While the Family Court dismissed the husband's divorce petition filed in 2008, another court party allowed the wife's DV complaint against the husband. The parties were married on March 16, 2003.   The husband submitted that his wife suffered from Tuberculosis and he was providing her with the necessary medical facilities. However, she was whimsical, short-tempered and stubborn and misbehaved with her  family. Their fights caused him mental agony, he claimed. A year after the marriage, the wife contracted "herpes" and her HIV test turned out positive, again causing him mental agony. Moreover, she left the house in 2005.   Apparently when she returned to her matrimonial home two years later, she was asked to return as the mother-in-law was mentally disturbed. The man's lawyer argued that there was an irretrievable breakdown of marriage.   Conversely, the wife claimed that she had tested negative for HIV. Despite this the man was spreading rumours about her causing her a great deal of mental agony. She submitted through her lawyer that her "social life was destroyed." Moreover, under section 12 of the DV proceedings a court had directed the husband to pay Rs 5 lakh towards damages and a 1-BHK flat for her accommodation.   In its order the bench noted that the husband failed to give details of any specific incidents of his parents being treated badly. There were also no details of quarrels between the two. However, the man revealed during the cross-examination that his wife hadn't mentally or physically tortured him. Regarding allegations about being HIV positive, the bench noted that no report was produced to demonstrate the same.  The woman had examined a scientist in National Aids Research Institute who identified the tests conducted in his laboratory showing that the petitioner was not suffering from HIV.   "The burden was cast upon the Petitioner to prove that the Respondent was suffering from venereal disease in a communicable form. There is not an iota of evidence produced by the Petitioner that the Respondent had tested positive for HIV, which caused him mental agony or that the Respondent has treated him with cruelty," the bench observed.   The court also rejected the husband's allegation of desertion based on his admission that he asked his wife to leave the matrimonial home following his mother's objection.   "In our opinion, the Petitioner has failed to prove the essential ingredients of desertion i.e. both the factum of separation and animus deserendi," the bench said and dismissed his appeal.

In a survey conducted on the virtual court hearings, a majority of participating Supreme Court lawyers expressed the need to replace the Vidyo App with a more effective one, such as Cisco Webex.

In a survey conducted on the virtual court hearings, a majority of participating Supreme Court lawyers expressed the need to replace the Vidyo App with a more effective one, such as Cisco Webex.  The Advocates said that they were routinely either unable to log in or were automatically logged out during Court proceedings. Further, the Vidyo App did not offer an effective screen sharing feature due to which, they were precluded from showing certain documents or Judgments to the Bench, which could ordinarily have been handed across in Court.  Participants also felt that there ought to be a viewing room for Advocates or litigants who just wished to observe Court proceedings, without participating in them.  Thus, 159 of the 210 Advocates who had taken part in hearings through Video Conferencing before the Supreme Court, suggested that the Supreme Court should migrate to a different software application for conducting hearings through Video Conferencing.  The Survey was conducted by five Advocates on Record at the Supreme Court namely, Bhabna Das, D. Abhinav Rao, Harsh Parashar, Krishna Dev J. and RV Yogesh, with an aim to find ways and means to improve the digital systems in place at present.  A total of 227 Advocates participated in the survey, including 13 Senior Advocates, 133 Advocates-on-Record and 81 Advocates, including 8 Advocates representing their Law Firms.  Due to the technical issues with VIDYO App, 155 of 218 Advocates strongly felt that the Supreme Court should migrate to a different software application.  "Cisco Webex, which is being successfully used inter alia by the Delhi High Court and NCLAT was the most popular choice amongst Advocates," the report highlighted.  Another concern expressed by most participants was that only a single person was responsible for co-ordinating the entire link sharing exercise, which lead to him being overburdened and unavailable to address grievances.  "There is absolutely no clarity on who is to be contacted in case of any technical issue in connecting via the link shared," many Advocates stated.  They suggested that the Supreme Court should have separate designated officers for each Virtual Court, who would be constantly available over the phone to respond to any technical queries and assist with problems which arose during a virtual hearing.  E-FILING   79.3% out of 213 Advocates had availed the E-filing facility of Supreme Court. While most of them (98 out of 166) preferred E-filing to Physical Filing, a significant portion [41%] of Advocates had faced some problems with the E-filing mechanism.   8 Advocates stated that they had been unable to use it because of technical issues.  Participants also gave feedback that they found the defect curing system for E-filing to be "tedious", and that most clerks struggled with the same. They expressed concerns regarding filing of voluminous petitions, as the process of uploading the petition and the printing of the same by the Registry caused a lot of delay  As per the report,  "By and large, Advocates feel that the interface is not user friendly, unnecessarily requires filling in of too many details at the Advocates' end, and that the support from the Registry is inadequate. Advocates are also anxious about the Diary Numbers not being generated immediately on E-filing, unlike a physical filing."  MENTIONING & LISTING  41.8% of the participating Advocates were able to get their matters listed "only after filing a Mentioning Application indicating some urgency".  Further, where Mentioning Applications were rejected, no reasons were furnished for the same, leading to lack of clarity as to when the matter is likely to be listed.  "There has been a significant delay of 10 days or more in listing of the cases of a large proportion of participants i.e. 34%. On some occasions, this delay has been caused despite filing a Mentioning Application, which has remained pending for several days," the report indicated.

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday held that short artificial breaks in service between successive contracts cannot be used as a device to deny maternity rights to the employees. Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan noted that as per the Government Order dated January 2021, the employee should have "actually" worked for a period of not less than 80 days immediately preceding her expected date of delivery or date of miscarriage to be eligible for maternity benefits and that artificial breaks are not a valid ground to deny the same. "By employing the word 'actually', the Government wanted to include persons such as the petitioners who have been working for years together. Furthermore, I have no doubt in my mind that the artificial break-in of two days inserted between successive contracts cannot be used as a device to deny the benefits to which the petitioners, as female officers, were entitled by way of maternity benefits." It was also noted that a similar view was taken by this Court in a judgment in 2018 wherein this Court had held that the petitioners therein were allowed renewal based on their satisfactory service, the artificial break of one day is only to be ignored. Justice Vijayaraghavan also reinstated that women who constitute almost half of the segment of the society have to be honoured and treated with dignity at places where they work to earn their livelihood. It was further observed that whatever be the nature of their duties, their avocation and the place where they work, women must be provided with all the facilities to which they are entitled.  "To become a mother is the most natural phenomenon in the life of a woman. The employer has to be considerate and sympathetic to the cause of the female officer and no action shall be taken to lower the dignity of the women employee in the workplace. The employer is to take all steps possible to ensure that they are sympathetic to the cause of the female officer so that she can achieve her potential in the workplace and the time spent by her to deliver and raise her child shall not be detrimental to her career or her prospects." The Court noted that the Maternity Benefit Act aims to provide all these facilities to a working woman in a dignified manner so that she may overcome the state of motherhood honourably, peaceably, and undeterred by the fear of being victimized for forced absence during the pre or post-natal period.  Three women working as IT Programmers at the Kerala University of Health Sciences on a contract basis approached the Court aggrieved by the denial of maternity benefits to them by their employer despite having met the required conditions. The 1st and 3rd petitioners have been working with KUHS for the past 9 years and the 2nd petitioner for the past 5 years. During their term, they had all applied for maternity leave and the same was granted to them but they were eventually denied any allowance in furtherance of the same. The State issued a Government Order extending the benefit of maternity leave on full pay in terms of Rule 100, Part I of the Kerala Service Rules up to a period of 180 days or till the expiry of the existing contract whichever is earlier to female officers appointed on contract basis, irrespective of the tenure of the contract, subject to the condition that the leave will not be admissible from a date before 3 weeks from the expected date of confinement as certified by the medical officer. This was made applicable to Rule 101 as well.  However, as per clause (4) of the order, no officer was entitled to these benefits unless she has actually worked under the employer for a period of not less than 80y days immediately preceding her expected date of delivery or date of miscarriage.  The petitioners submitted separate applications seeking benefits as per this Order. However, their requests were rejected on the ground that each period of the contract has to be considered a separate posting. The respondents proceeded to deny the benefits to petitioners 1 and 3 on the ground that they had not completed the stipulated 80 days of contract service prior to the date of confinement. Insofar as the 2nd petitioner is concerned, KUHS took the view that her application for maternity leave cannot be considered since her delivery took place on 19.12.2020, a day, which was a break period between her two contracts. Being aggrieved, they approached the Court. In the counter affidavit filed by the State, it was argued that as per Rule 2 Appendix VIII of Part I of the KSR, maternity leave is admissible to provisional female recruits only when they continue beyond one year. Relying on the provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, they argued that a woman is entitled to benefits only if she has worked for a period of not less than 80 days in the 12 months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery. Therefore, it was submitted that the request of the petitioners was rightly rejected and no interference is warranted.  On the other hand, Advocate Dhanya P. Asokan appearing for the petitioners asserted that the Maternity Benefit Act was enacted to regulate the employment of women for certain periods before and after childbirth and to provide for maternity benefits and certain other benefits. She added that Article 42 of the Constitution requires the State to make provisions for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief.  The counsel further submitted that it has been unequivocally held by this Court that the benefits of enhanced maternity leave to women employees are undoubtedly a piece of welfare legislation which is intended to give women equal opportunities in public employment. She urged that the State has a responsibility to ensure that a restricted meaning is not given to welfare legislation so that the rights of women employees to avail leave are not restricted one way or the other. It was also pointed out that the petitioners had been actually working in the University for years together and merely to deny them maternity reliefs to which they are legitimately entitled, KUHS had relied on an artificial break-in of 2 days between the successive extension of contracts.  She contended that when employees are allowed renewal based on their satisfactory service, the artificial break of two days is only to be ignored and that continuous engagement of a person with an artificial break-in is a device designed by some unscrupulous employers to keep on engaging persons without regularizing them thereby denying them the benefits of regular employees.  Standing Counsel P. Sreekumar appearing for the KUHS and Government Pleader Anima argued that neither under the provisions of the KSR nor under Government order would the petitioners be entitled to maternity benefits. The Court opined that the word "actually" has been consciously used in the impugned Government P4 order. It noted that from the appointment orders itself, it was evident that the KUHS is working with the minimum number of staff and it was when the same had adversely affected the workflow of the University that recommendations were obtained from the system manager and after reckoning the qualifications and the prior experience of the petitioners in the University that the Vice-Chancellor chose to accord sanction to appoint the petitioners as programmers. It was also undisputed that the 1st and 3rd petitioners have been working under the 2nd respondent for the past 9 years and the 2nd petitioner for the past 5 years. Therefore, the artificial breaks in service of 2 days were to be ignored, the Judge held.  As such, the impugned orders denying maternity benefits to the petitioners were quashed and KUHS was directed to forthwith calculate the maternity benefits to which the petitioners are entitled and to disburse the same expeditiously within two months. Case Title: Naziya & Ors. v. State of Kerala  
The Calcutta High Court on Thursday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the National Investigation Authority (NIA) to probe an alleged case of forced conversion in West Bengal's Malda district. Justice Rajasekhar Mantha was adjudicating upon a plea moved by two women who had claimed that their husbands, brothers by relation and residents of Kaliachak area of the district, were converted from Hinduism to Islam by force as part of a punishment for working for a political party which lost the last assembly election. Accordingly, the Court sought inputs from the agencies with regard to allegations of forced conversions, cross-border infiltration, threats and intimidation by accumulation and storage of huge quantities of arms and ammunition, and counterfeit currency. "Since the NIA and the CBI are the party respondents to the instant proceeding, appropriate inputs may be given from their side as regards the allegations made in the writ petition,  the Court directed.  Furthermore, the Superintendent of Police (SP), Malda was also asked to cooperate with the two agencies. The petitioners, who are also sisters, claimed that their husbands were missing since November 24 last year but the police authorities had not taken any step in the matter even after being informed. The state government, however, submitted that the two had converted to Islam voluntarily and they had left home because of a family dispute Pursuant to the rival submissions, the Court observed that it is surprising to note that the police station had not registered first information reports (FIRs) or ordered any steps as per the dictum in the Supreme Court case of Lalita Kumari v. Govt of UP & Ors. Thus, the Court instructed the Superintendent of Police, Malda to independently submit a detailed report on the allegations of the petitioners, steps taken by the police, or any other vital information that would be necessary for the determination of the issues raised in the petition. The Superintendent of Police was also ordered to review the security of the petitioners and take immediate measures in that regard, since they apprehended serious threat to their lives. "A detailed chronology of events before and after receipt of complaints from the petitioners may also be set out by the SP," the order read.  Other allegations made by the petitioners such as random forcible conversion, cross border infiltration, threats and intimidation, storage of huge quantities of arms and ammunition and counterfeit currency may also be addressed by the agencies, the Court stated.  "The aforesaid allegations may not be directly in issue to the claim of the writ petitioners but appear vitally linked to the allegations of abduction and forcible conversion of the petitioners' husbands", the Court directed further.  Accordingly, the matter was listed for further hearing on June 21.  Case Title: Smt Kalabati Mondal v. Union of India

In a significant order, the Allahabad High Court has allowed conduct of DNA Test in a murder trial as it noted that the same was in the interets of justice to unearth the truthfulness of the prosecution's case. However, the bench of Justice Gautam Chowdhary did stress that the DNA test should not to be directed as a matter of routine and in only deserving cases where a strong prima facie case is made out. The Court noted that the contention of the murder accused that he is innocent would be proved if the DNA samples are not matched and it would come on the record that he was being falsely roped in the case. The case in brief  An FIR was lodged by Hardeo Singh/Informant under Section 302 I.P.C. alleging that Mohan Singh (Murder accused) has abused and shot his mother, who had gone to the market to purchase some articles. After the filing of the charge sheet, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions.  During the pendency of the trial, the accused contended that the deceased had died somewhere else and that the Investigating Officer had prepared the wrong Naksha Nazari of the place of incident and the accused was falsely implicated in the case since the place of occurrence was recorded in the investigation was not correct. Therefore, he moved an application under Section 233 Cr.P.C. stating therein that the prosecution may be directed to provide the blood sample of the family members of the victim and be sent to the Forensic Laboratory for conducting the DNA test of the blood collected from earth (from the place of the incident) to ensure as to whether both are same or not. It was his primary contention that if the blood of the stained earth and the blood of the family members of the victim are found to be the same, then it could be said that the prosecution has a valid case and therefore, all this can be ascertained by way of DNA test only. Further, when the prosecution raised the contention that conduct of the DNA test would result in the violation of the privacy of the family member of the deceased, the accused contended that there would be no adversity for the informant, in case, the Court directs for DNA test of the family members of the victim with the blood-stained earth mud, and the same could help him (accused) in proving his innocence.  However, on the application of the accused, the objection was filed from the side of the prosecution, and thereafter, said application was rejected, the same was under challenge in the instant application before the High Court.  Before the High Court, the Counsel for the informant submitted that if a person refuses to undergo for a DNA test, then he cannot be forced/compelled to undergo the same as such the informant or his family members also cannot be forced to undergo for DNA test as it relates to their privacy. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that in case, the DNA is directed to be conducted and DNA matched, then the accused may be convicted and in case, the DNA does not match, then the contention that the applicant is innocent would be proved.  In view of this, the Court opined that in the instant case, the DNA test was not beingb sought to establish the relationship between the applicant and informant, rather the same has been requested to prove the innocence of the applicant, therefore, the Court noted, there would be no impinge on his personal liberty and his right to privacy of the informant or his family members. "It is the case of the applicant that false naksha najri has been prepared to implicate him as the incident has taken place somewhere else and is shown to have occurred at the place mentioned in the FIR, it would be primary to ascertain the place of the incident first so as to gain faith in the prosecution story as narrated in the FIR. The said requirement can be best served by obtaining DNA result of the blood sample of the informant or his relative with the blood stained earth recovered from the alleged place of occurrence" the Court remarked. Considering the facts and circumstances in its entirety, the Court opined that to arrive at just decision of the case and to avoid any suspicion or doubt in the prosecution case, it would be in the interest of justice that DNA test may be conducted. Therefore, the Court held that the Court below has committed illegality in passing the impugned order, therefore the same was set aside and the Court directed that the blood sample of the informant or any of his family members be taken for conducting the DNA test with the blood stained earth collected from the alleged place of occurrence to unearth the truthfulness of the prosecution case.

The Orissa High Court has clarified that a complainant need not mention the detailed particulars of every single act of domestic violence in the complaint itself.

The Orissa High Court has clarified that a complainant need not mention the detailed particulars of every single act of domestic violence in the complaint itself. Thus, even a prima facie disclosure of acts of violence would be sufficient to maintain a complaint under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDV Act).  While rejecting a revision petition praying to drop the proceedings, the Single Judge Bench of Justice Sashikanta Mishra observed,  “After perusing the complaint petition, this Court is of the considered view that some allegations have been made undoubtedly in general terms but then it is not expected of the complainant to cite the detailed particulars of every single such act that may be treated as an act of domestic violence.”  Factual Background  The petitioners are the parents-in-law of the opposite party, who married their son on 13.12.2015. It was alleged that she was subjected to domestic violence by her husband and in-laws on different grounds including for additional dowry. After being tortured regularly, the opposite party was constrained to file a complaint under Section 12 of the PWDV Act in the Court of SDJM, Berhampur.   The petitioners appeared and filed an application to drop the proceeding against them as there was hardly any material to proceed against them. However, the SDJM rejected their plea holding that the application clearly makes out a case against them. Subsequently, they preferred an appeal before the Court of Sessions and to their dismay, the Appellate Court also held that the complaint petition prima facie reveals a case of domestic violence. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.  Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioners approached the High Court in the present revision.  Contentions of the Petitioners  Surya Prasad Mishra, senior counsel for the petitioners contended that if the averments made in the complaint petition are viewed objectively, it would reveal that the allegations are directed mainly against the husband. He argued, firstly there are no allegations as such to show commission of domestic violence and secondly, the same are too general in nature to be taken note of judicially.   He also submitted that there is a tendency to implicate all the in-laws and other family members only to harass them and therefore, he prayed the Court to judiciously separate the “grain from the chaff”. To buttress his arguments, he placed reliance on Shyamlal Devda & Ors. v. Parimala.  Contentions of the Opposite Party  S.K. Pradhan, advocate for the opposite party contended that ‘strict rules of pleading’ are not applicable to a complaint filed under the Domestic Violence Act. He also submitted that having regard for the statutory intent of protecting women from domestic violence, it would suffice if the complaint prima facie contains allegations which can be subsequently proved by adducing evidence.   He submitted that there are enough materials to show that the opposite party was subjected to physical, mental, verbal and emotional torture by the petitioners at different points of time and thus, both the courts below have rightly rejected the contentions advanced by them.  Court’s Observations  After perusing the complaint as a whole, the Court acknowledged the averments made therein to the effect that the husband of the complainant used to exhibit violent behaviour and the petitioners allegedly encouraged him to do so and also restrained the complainant from disclosing the same to her parents.   Further, the Bench was of the view that though some of the allegations have been made in general terms, it is not expected of the complainant to explain the ‘detailed particulars’ of every single such act of domestic violence Accordingly, the Court noted,  “Thus, while the main allegations appear to be directed against the husband, the role of the present petitioners appears to be confined to supporting their son and in omitting to restrain him from exhibiting violent behavior towards the complainant. Read as a whole, it cannot be said that the averments do not make out a case of domestic violence against the petitioners. On the contrary, this Court is of the view that the averments, prima facie, show acts of domestic violence by the petitioners against the complainant by way of commission as well as omission.”   However, it clarified that the allegations need to be proved in an appropriate proceeding before the competent Court to hold the petitioners guilty. But at this preliminary stage, the allegations made in the complaint would suffice to continue the proceedings against them.  The Court also said that Shyamlal Devda (supra) can be easily distinguished factually as in the said case several other family members apart from the husband and parents-in-law were impleaded as parties without any specific allegations of domestic violence against them. Under such circumstances, the Apex Court had observed that in the absence of specific allegations, the case of domestic violence was liable to be quashed against the relatives.  Resultantly, the revision petition was dismissed being devoid of merit.  Case Title: Girish Prasad Mishra & Anr. v. Smt.

Court noted there is no evidence regarding ownership or actual running of educational institution.The Gujarat High Court recently refused to interfere with an order passed by the Executive Engineer of the Surat Municipal Corporation, directing removal of an alleged "Madrassa" said to be constructed on a government land, on the ground that the construction was without prior permission of the competent authority. "In the opinion of the Court, in absence of any evidence on record regarding actual running of educational institution and there is nothing on record to indicate any permission to running educational institution or building permission to put up construction of educational institution and the factual assertion not being controverted that the premises were being used for commercial purpose, the Court is not inclined to interfere with the ongoing process, which according to the Court is in accordance with the provisions of GDCR," Justice AY Kogje said. The Petitioners, Madrasa-e-Anware Rabbani Waqf Committee, had filed a petition for the quashing of the impugned notice and order which declared that the Petitioner-Waqf was unauthorised occupant of the government land and the construction on such land was illegal. The Petitioner also sought a direction to the Respondent authorities for the regularisation of the construction of the premises of the Petitioner.  The Petitioner's case was that the subject land was originally owned by five brothers and by way of an oral gift deed had been transferred in favour of the Waqf which was representation by the Petitioner as its 'Muttwali'. The Petitioner thereafter was running a 'Madrassa' to provide education to Muslim students. However, since the transaction was an oral gift deed, the same could not be entered into the revenue record. Subsequently, in 2021, the City Survey Superintendent under Section 61 of the Land Revenue Code ordered the removal of the construction of the Madrassa on the ground that the construction was illegal even as a penalty was imposed on the Petitioner. The Waqf Tribunal directed the petitioner to submit an application for fresh development permission or regularization along with necessary plans and directed respondent Nos.1 and 2 to decide such application in accordance with law. However, vide an order of 28th March 2022, the Respondent (Executive Engineer) ordered the removal of construction within 7 days. Hence, the present proceedings were instituted. Per contra, the Respondent authorities submitted that the subject land was acquired by the government in 1967 and the original owners had received compensation in this regard. The land, was therefore, owned by the State authorities and the Petitioner had any legal right to occupy the structure nor did the Madrassa own any permissions for the safety of children. It was submitted that the Petitioner was coming in way of development of the land for public purposes.  Judgement  Justice AY Kogje observed that the photographs of the property did not indicate the running of the school but rather the shutters showed that there was a commercial establishment (garage). Further, in issues of running educational institutions, the same is governed by the Gujarat Development Control Regulations along with permission of the authorities. There was nothing on record to show that the construction was carried out for developmental purposes. No evidence was placed that students were studying in the establishment.  Further, the land in question, owned by the five brothers had been duly compensated for in 1967 and a possession receipt was issued to that effect by the brothers. To the Bench it seemed that the Petitioner and other occupants of the plot were taking advantage of the fact that no revenue records were present. The State Government was advised to monitor the situation closely to correct such lapses, including holding public servants responsible.   The Court said that the Petitioner had also failed to show any renovation and 'construction completion' certificate to the State in response to the impugned notice issued under Section 260(1)(a) of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, 1949. Additionally, because the Petitioner could not advance any document to prove lawful occupation, the Petitioner's property could not get the development permission or regularisation of construction of any nature.  Keeping in view all these reasons, the Bench was not inclined to interfere with the process initiated by the State authority. Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.  Case Title: MADRASA-E-ANWARE RABBANI WAQF COMMITTEE v/s SURAT MUNICIPAL CORPORATION      
The Madras High Court has recently come to the support of tribal women in their struggle for equal succession rights. The court has noted that the Hindu Succession Law does not to exclude tribal women from its operation but only intends to positively include the customs.  Clause (2) of Section 2 of the Hindu Succession Act states that the Act shall not apply to the members of the Scheduled Tribe unless the Central Government by notification in the official gazette otherwise directs.  Justice SM Subramaniam highlighted that the exclusion under Section 2(2) of the Hindu Succession Act should not come in the way of inheritance by tribal women in areas where Hinduism and Buddhism were being followed.   Nothing has been shown about the custom and practice prevailing in the community, where the parties to the lis on hand belong. But the tribal women are deprived of adopting the Hindu Succession Act. Therefore, Sub Section (2) of Section 2 of the Hindu Succession Act 1956, will not come in the way of inheritance of the property by the daughters belonging to the tribal area, where Hinduism and Buddhism are followed.  The court also directed the State government to initiate necessary steps for issuing notifications through the Central Government to protect the rights of tribal women in the state.  However, the Government of Tamil Nadu shall initiate necessary steps for the purpose of issuing appropriate notification through Central Government under Section 2(2) of the Hindu Succession Act 1956, to protect the equal property right of the tribal women in the state of Tamil Nadu.  The court added that mere non-issuance of the notification or its postponement cannot deprive tribal women from getting their right in the family property. Thus, Section 2(2) was not a complete bar.  Thus, Section 2(2) cannot be construed as a complete bar for invoking the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. But it paves way for the Central Government to notify the tribal communities, who have already moved forward and whose primitive customs and practice are not prevailing amongst the community for inheritance.  The court was hearing an appeal challenging the orders of the Trial court wherein the trial court had invoked the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act and held that the tribal women are also entitled for an equal share in their family property on par with other male coparcenors.  On appeal, the appellant mainly contended that Section 2(2) of the Hindu Succession Act clearly excludes tribal women from the application of the Hindu Succession Act and thus the trial court had erroneously applied the law.  The respondents however contended that since the appellants failed to establish the custom and practice prevailing in the community to which they belong, they would be governed by the Hindu Succession Act. Thus, the trial court was right in relying upon the law. It was also contended that tribal women cannot be deprived or denied of an equal share on par with other female Hindus in the state as the same would amount to unconstitutionality and discrimination.  The court, after establishing that the parties belonged to notified tribal community, went on to examine the customs and practices which prevailed within their community for the purpose of applying the exclusion clause contained in Section 2(2). When there was no established custom and practice, the provisions of the Act will come into effect.  The court also observed that the legislature did not intend for any inequality or unconstitutionality and its intention was only to protect the customs and practices strongly prevailing amongst the community. Thus, a golden interpretation of the legislature had to be adopted and not a negative interpretation depriving women from getting an equal share.

The Supreme Court observed that the burden of proof on an accused in support of the defence taken under Section 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure is not beyond all reasonable doubt as it lies on the prosecution to prove the chargeThe accused has merely to create a doubt and it is for the prosecution then to establish beyond reasonable doubt that no benefit can flow from the same to the... The Supreme Court observed that the burden of proof on an accused in support of the defence taken under Section 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure is not beyond all reasonable doubt as it lies on the prosecution to prove the charge The accused has merely to create a doubt and it is for the prosecution then to establish beyond reasonable doubt that no benefit can flow from the same to the accused, the bench of  Justices Navin Sinha and R. Subhash Reddy said while acquitting a woman accused of murdering her sister in law. In this case, the deceased died in the matrimonial home in about one and a half years of the marriage suffering 95% burn injuries. The younger brother of deceased aged about 11 - 12 years was the sole eye witness. The sister in law of the deceased, along with other accused were charged for murder. The Trial Court convicted her relying on the testimony of the child witness that she stuffed cloth in the mouth of the deceased after which she was set on fire by other accused. The High Court dismissed her appeal. In appeal, the accused contended that she had taken a specific defence in her statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that she resided in her matrimonial home, which was separate and at a distance. It was further contended that the allegation against her by the child witness was never put to her under Section 313 CrPC thus depriving her of a valuable opportunity 1 of defence which vitiates her conviction. "We are of the considered opinion that in absence of any question having been put to her in this regard under Section 313 CrPC the appellant has been seriously prejudiced in her defence. It has repeatedly been held that the procedure under Section 313 CrPC is but a facet of the principles of natural justice giving an opportunity to an accused to present the defence. The burden of proof on an accused in support of the defence taken under Section 313 CrPC is not beyond all reasonable doubt as it lies on the prosecution to prove the charge. The accused has merely to create a doubt. It will be for the prosecution then to establish beyond reasonable doubt that no benefit can flow from the same to the accused. The mere fact that the house of the appellant was at near quarters cannot ipso facto lead to a conclusion with regard to her presence in her parental home at the time of occurrence. It is a fact to be established and assessed from the evidence on record.", the court said accepting the accused's contention [referred to Janak Yadav v. State of Bihar, (1999) 9 SCC 125]. Not Deposed That Closed Was Taken From Her Mouth The court noted that at no stage, the witness deposed that the cloth was taken out from her mouth, but stated that the deceased was speaking while she was being taken to hospital. "It stands to reason that if cloth was stuffed in the mouth of deceased she would have been unable to speak.", the bench noted. The bench also noticed that the doctor who performed post mortem also stated that no cloth was present in the mouth of the deceased and that all the 32 teeth were intact. "The discussion and reasoning by the trial court that absence of any cloth in the mouth was irrelevant because if the deceased suffered hundred per cent burns the cloth naturally could not be available, suggesting that it would have been burnt also is completely fallacious.", the bench said while observing that the evidence of child witness in this case attributing a specific role to the accused is not of such a sterling quality so as to inspire confidence in the court to base the conviction on the sole evidence of a child witness.  She was a daughter-in-law like the deceased herself "She was a daughter-in-law like the deceased herself. The nature of the evidence makes it highly unlikely that she would have engaged in such actions. The benefit of doubt in the circumstances has to be given to the appellant.", the bench said while setting aside conviction of the accused. Mere absence of any corroborative evidence in addition to that of the child witness by itself cannot alone discredit a child witness.  Though, the court in this case disbelieved the child witness, it said that criminal jurisprudence does not hold that the evidence of a child witness is unreliable and can be discarded.  "A child who is aged about 11 to 12 years certainly has reasonably developed mental faculty to see, absorb and appreciate. In a given case the evidence of a child witness alone can also form the basis for conviction. The mere absence of any corroborative evidence in addition to that of the child witness by itself cannot alone discredit a child witness. But the Courts have regularly held that where a child 2 witness is to be considered, and more so when he is the sole witness, a heightened level of scrutiny is called for of the evidence so that the Court is satisfied with regard to the reliability and genuineness of the evidence of the child witness. PW-2 was examined nearly one year after the occurrence. The Court has, therefore, to satisfy itself that all possibilities of tutoring or otherwise are ruled out and what was deposed was nothing but the truth."

The Supreme Court observed that while determining compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act, a court cannot direct the continued maintenance by Insurance Company of a prosthetic limb for the injured claimant.The process of determination of such compensation cannot be by a continuing mandamus, in a colloquial sense, and the determination must take place at one go, the bench of Justices... The Supreme Court observed that while determining compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act, a court cannot direct the continued maintenance by Insurance Company of a prosthetic limb for the injured claimant. The process of determination of such compensation cannot be by a continuing mandamus, in a colloquial sense, and the determination must take place at one go, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy observed. In this case, while allowing an appeal filed by a claimant, the High Court directed that he shall be supplied a prosthetic limb of good quality and with a lifetime warranty. It was further directed that if any, repair or replacement has to be done, the same should be done by the Insurance Company and that it should inquire from the victim at least twice a year as to the working condition of the prosthetic limb with an email address and telephone number specified. Insurance company filed appeal before the Apex Court contending that these directions amount to a continuing maintenance of the prosthetic limb to be monitored by it. Relying on Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh & Others, (2003) 2 SCC 274 and Sapna V. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (2008) 7 SCC 613 it was contended that while determining compensation under the said Act there is no provision providing for passing of a further award once the final award is passed. The future eventualities are to be taken into consideration at that time, it was argued. "In our view, the process of determination of such compensation cannot be by a continuing mandamus, in a colloquial sense, and the determination must take place at one go. The aforesaid principle is not even disagreed to or contested by the respondents but what is submitted is that there must be a provision made fixing a lump sum amount for maintenance/ replacement of the prosthetic limb, if necessary. We agree with the submission and in a larger canvas consider it appropriate to direct that in such kind of cases of providing facility of prosthetic limb, appropriate amount may be quantified towards such maintenance.", the bench observed. The bench thus set aside these directions and observed that the same shall be substituted by the determination for amount required for maintenance/replacement of the prosthetic limb while a quantification of the amount for compensation is being made. The court directed the claimant to file an affidavit setting forth the cost of the prosthetic limb purchased by him along with supporting documents of the company from which he purchased the prosthetic limb, to show what kind of maintenance/replacement would be required. In a another case, the High Court had directed that assistance of two semi-skilled workers on the basis of minimum wages is to be provided to the claimant from the date of the accident for the rest of the his life. It was also directed that sum of Rs.60 Lakhs is required to be kept by the Insurance Company in an interest bearing deposit, from which about Rs.50,000/- per month would be generated as interest to meet the expenses of the assistants.  "It may not be strictly in the nature of a continuing direction; but premised on the basis of a continuing requirement, a lump sum amount has been directed to be deposited the returns from which are to be utilised. We are of the view that this is not the appropriate course to follow.", the court observed while allowing the appeal filed by insurance company. The court also noticed that the High Court had also directed the GNCTD to examine whether there could be a Government policy in regard to assistance to be provided to permanently disabled adolescents whose parents are not economically well off.  "We also find that while seeking to examine the larger issues, the learned judge has ventured into the aspect of Government policy to be framed in that behalf. This really amounts to beyond the jurisdiction over determination of the amount, in the Motor Accident Claim proceeding, but on a larger canvas taking the colour of a Public Interest Litigation. We, thus, consider it appropriate that this aspect ought to be examined by the Bench dealing with the Public Interest Litigation, as a larger canvas would have to be determined rather than something restricted to the case of the respondent before us.", the court said.

Stressing that non-interference by the Court would reduce the lady and two children without shelter of husband/father and which wouldn't be in the interest of justice, the Gujarat High Court last week quashed the lower court's conviction order against a man for raping his minor wife. In this case, the alleged victim (wife) had admitted that she, on her own, started living with the convict/appellant as his wife and she had even given birth to his two children. Importantly, neither she nor the convict/husband disowned the birth and paternity of their two children. Read more details of the case here: "System Laughing At Us": Gujarat HC Orders Release Of Rape Convict With Whom 'Victim' Willingly Married, Gave Birth To Children The wife/woman admitted that appellant/convict/husband had kept physical relation with her consent, however, in 2018, he was booked and later on, convicted by the trial Court under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 4, 6, 8 and 12 of the Protection of the Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Against this backdrop, the Bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay observed that for Law enforcement agencies this might be termed as an offence under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, however, he did note that the same was observed more in the breach than in compliance, more particularly in the lower strata of society. Background  Notably, the appellant and the 'victim' were living together even during the pendency of trial as the man was out on bail and even the trial court took note of this fact that the man and the 'victim' were living with each other as husband-wife and they even had kids, however, the lower court still convicted him for rape and other offences under POCSO Act. Essentially, the case was tried before the Special Judge (POCSO), Junagadh and the Trial Court vide judgment dated 15.07.2021 convicted him under the aforementioned offences. Earlier, in August 2021, while hearing this case, commenting upon the conviction judgment and order passed against the man, the Bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay had orally observed in Gujarati thus: "Implementation of law with the complete non-application of mind…we have to think over such matters collectively. I can't find fault with the trial court because it was under obligation to implement the law, even the prosecution can't be blamed." "System Laughing At Us": Gujarat HC Orders Release Of Rape Convict With Whom 'Victim' Willingly Married, Gave Birth To Children Calling it the glaring aspect of the matter, the Court had noted that neither the mother ('victim') nor the father (rape convict) of the two children disowned their birth nor paternity, and still, the Court added, the father is convicted inter alia under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and is ordered to undergo RI for 10 years. In fact, the Court noted that the Sessions Court was conscious of the fact that victim and man had married each other since it noted in its judgment that both are staying as husband and wife and thus, any compensation/assistance received from any of the Government(s) needs to be refunded. 
The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Tuesday (7 September 2021) upheld the dismissal of a 'Title' suit filed 54 years ago on 5th August 1967.We find that the judgment of the trial court dismissing the suit is correct, the bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna observed while setting aside the Patna High Court order and first appellate court order that had decreed the... The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on Tuesday (7 September 2021) upheld the dismissal of a 'Title' suit filed 54 years ago on 5th August 1967. We find that the judgment of the trial court dismissing the suit is correct, the bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna observed while setting aside the Patna High Court order and first appellate court order that had decreed the suit. The 'Title' suit in this case was filed before the court of Subordinate Judge, Sitamarhi, was dismissed by it on 31st May, 1986. The first appellate court, on 7th December, 1988, allowed the appeal preferred by plaintiffs and decreed the suit.  The second appeal preferred by the legal heirs of  the defendant was dismissed by a single Judge of the High Court on 25th May, 1989, by a short order recording that the findings of facts observed by the first appellate court were final finding of facts and no substantial question of law arose. They thus approached the Supreme Court, which observed that the High Court was not correct in dismissing the appeal in limine as there was a serious dispute concerning title of the land. Vide order dated 23rd February, 2000, the case was remanded for de novo consideration by the High Court. On 20th March, 2009, the High Court, after considering the matter afresh dismissed the second appeal.  In appeal, the Apex Court bench considered whether the plaintiffs have established their title over the suit land and hence were entitled to a decree of possession against legal heirs of the deceased defendant. The High Court had that the plaintiffs had title over the suit land.  Taking note of the evidence on record, the court found that the plaintiffs were not owners of the property on the date they had filed the present suit for title and possession on 5th August, 1967. Therefore, it set aside the judgments of first appellate court and High Court and upheld the dismissal of the suit by the Trial Court.     
The Allahabad High Court has recently held that Marriage Certificates issued by Arya Samaj have no statutory force. It was further held that in the absence of a valid marriage, the marriage certificate of Arya Samaj is not proof of a valid marriage. The observation came from the bench of Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Rajendra Kumar-IV which was dealing with a first appeal filed by one Ashish Morya challenging an order of the Principal Judge, Family Court, Saharanpur dismissing his application filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Mourya had essentially filed a Section 9 HMA application seeking restitution of conjugal rights with the defendant, who he claimed to be his wife. However, the defendant-respondent clearly denied any marriage between her and the plaintiff-appellant.  The plaintiff/appellant claimed that both of them got married by following the rituals of Arya Samaj, and presented an Arya Samaj Trust marriage certificate, however, the Court refused to accept the factum of marriage as it noted that the plaintiff failed to place before the Court any statutory provisions enabling Arya Samaj to issue a marriage certificate. "Learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant has also completely failed to place before us any statutory provisions enabling the Arya Samaj to issue a marriage certificate. Thus, we have no difficulty holding that the Marriage Certificate issued by Arya Samaj has no statutory force...in the absence of a valid marriage, the marriage certificate of Arya Samaj is not proof of a valid marriage of the plaintiff-appellant and the defendant-respondent." the Court said. The Court further noted that the plaintiff/appellant had neither led any evidence nor filed any certificate of marriage as proof of marriage under Section 8 of HMA,1955 read with the Uttar Pradesh Hindu Marriage Registration Rules, 1973, or the Uttar Pradesh Registration of Marriage Rules, 2017. The Court also observed that as per Section 7 of the 1955 Act, a Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto and that where such rites and ceremonies include the Saptapadi i.e. the taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire, the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken.  In view of this, the Court noted that it was an admitted case of the plaintiff/appellant that the rites and ceremonies of Saptapadi had not taken place in the alleged marriage of the plaintiff with the defendant on 29.06.2021 and therefore, the court said that factum of the marriage was not proved. As far as his plea for restitution of conjugal rights was concerned, the Court noted that since there was no proof of valid marriage, therefore, the court below had not committed any error of law to dismiss the suit. "In our view, the existence of a valid marriage is a precondition to ask for relief of restitution of conjugal rights. In the absence of proof of a valid marriage, under the facts and circumstances of the case; the court below has not committed any error of law to dismiss the suit observing that merely getting a marriage certificate from Arya Samaj is not proof of a valid marriage," the Court noted as it dismissed the appeal.

The Delhi High Court has appointed Dr. Arul George Scaria as an expert to assist it in the interpretation of sec. 52(1)(za) of the Copyright Act, 1957 to the extent of fair use and fair dealing of sound recordings in marriage ceremonies and weddings. Dr. Scaria is the Associate Professor of Law and Co-Director, Centre for Innovation, IP and Competition at National law University, Delhi.  Justice Pratibha M Singh was of the view that the issue raised would have large scale implications for artists such as lyricists, music composers, singers, sound recording producers and owners on the one hand as also, for entities involved in the organisation and management of weddings and other social events.  "The issue would also concern society in general," the Court added.  It also said "This Court is of the opinion that, in the Indian context, music is an integral part of any wedding or marriage ceremony. The kind of music played typically ranges from devotional or spiritual music for the purposes of the marriage ceremony to popular music in various languages. Apart from the actual marriage ceremony itself, there are other ceremonies such as tilak, sagan, cocktail parties, dinner, mehndi, sangeet, etc., which have become an integral part of the wedding festivities. In all such ceremonies also music is played. The above provision was inserted into the statute by virtue of The Copyright Amendment Act 1994 w.e.f.10th May 1995." Accordingly, the Court directed the expert to file a written note of submissions on the issue raised and also to consider the legislative history of the provision and cite relevant case law, from India and abroad on the question of fair use and fair dealing.  The Court was dealing with a suit filed by Phonographic Performance Limited engaged in the business of issuance of licenses for public performance/communication to the public of sound recordings on the basis of assignments granted to it by its member record labels, i.e., owners of copyright in sound recordings.  The Plaintiff sought an injunction against the Defendant, Lookpart Exhibitions and Events Private Ltd., an event management company, providing various event management services, including DJ services for various social events, such as weddings. The case of the Plaintiff was that the Defendant was using sound recordings in respect of which the Plaintiff had rights, at various social events managed and organised by it at commercial venues, on a regular basis.  It was submitted that the Defendant, while organising its events, including weddings or marriage ceremonies and other social events, ought to obtain licences for playing music. However, according to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had refused to obtain a license despite correspondence having been addressed to the Defendant. On the other hand, the Defendant relied upon the Explanation to sec. 52(1)(za) to argue that when music is to be played for the purposes of marriage ceremonies or other social events connected with marriages, including a marriage procession, the use of music is deemed to be fair use, and hence, no licence would be required. Keeping the significance of the issue to be adjudicated in mind, the Court was of the opinion that the opinion of an expert would be of it's assistance.  The matter will now be heard on 6th July, 2022. Case Title: PHONOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE LIMITED v. LOOKPART EXHIBITIONS AND EVENTS PRIVATE LIMITED    
The Supreme Court has observed that the procedure of 'oral direction' not to arrest an accused is irregular.The court observed that the text of a written order is what is binding and enforceable and such oral directions can cause serious misgivings."Absent a written record of what has transpired in the course of a judicial proceeding, it would set a dangerous precedent if the parties and... The Supreme Court has observed that the procedure of 'oral direction' not to arrest an accused is irregular. The court observed that the text of a written order is what is binding and enforceable and such oral directions can cause serious misgivings. "Absent a written record of what has transpired in the course of a judicial proceeding, it would set a dangerous precedent if the parties and the investigating officer were expected to rely on unrecorded oral observations.", the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed. In this case, the accused had approached the Gujarat High Court by filing a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking quashing of FIR lodged against him Sections 405, 420, 465, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code. When this petition was pending, the accused was arrested. When the proceedings were taken up after this arrest, the Court noted that, an oral direction was issued by the Court restraining the arrest, and thus the judge directed that the accused should forthwith be released. In appeal, the court noted that the text of the order of the High Court did not contain any direction restraining the arrest of the accused.  Further it noted that only reasons for passing the impugned order are (i) Proceedings are pending between the parties; and (ii) Both of them have set the criminal machinery in action.  The court said that if the High Court thought it fit to grant an interim protection against arrest, a specific judicial order to that effect was necessary.  "Oral observations in court are in the course of a judicial discourse. The text of a written order is what is binding and enforceable. Issuing oral directions (presumably to the APP) restraining arrest, does not form a part of the judicial record and must be eschewed. Absent a judicial order, the investigating officer would have no official record emanating from the High Court on the basis of which a stay of arrest is enforced. The administration of criminal justice is not a private matter between the complainant and the accused but implicates wider interests of the State in preserving law and order as well as a societal interest in the sanctity of the criminal justice administration.", the court added. The court said that, unlike civil cases involve disputes between two private contestants, criminal proceedings, apart from the accused and the complainant, there is a vital interest of the State and of society in the prosecution of crime.  Procedure of issuing oral directions to not to arrest must be avoided The Supreme Court said that High Courts should eschew the practice of issuing oral directions to not to arrest.  "The procedure followed by the High Court of issuing an oral direction restraining the arrest of the first respondent was irregular",  the Court stated. It added : "The procedure which was followed by the Single Judge must therefore be eschewed in the future. Judges speak through their judgments and orders. The written text is capable of being assailed. The element of judicial accountability is lost where oral regimes prevail. This would set a dangerous precedent and is unacceptable. Judges, as much as public officials over whose conduct they preside, are accountable for their actions", it said. Element of judicial accountability is lost where oral regimes prevail "The element of judicial accountability is lost where oral regimes prevail. This would set a dangerous precedent and is unacceptable. Judges, as much as public officials over whose conduct they preside, are accountable for their actions". Such a procedure is open to grave abuse, would set a dangerous precedent "Oral directions of this nature by the High Court are liable to cause serious misgivings. Such a procedure is open to grave abuse. Most High Courts deal with high volumes of cases. Judicial assessments change with the roster. Absent a written record of what has transpired in the course of a judicial proceeding, it would set a dangerous precedent if the parties and the investigating officer were expected to rely on unrecorded oral observations" Referring to Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, the bench observed that the reasons recorded by the Court while issuing an interim order must reflect an application of mind to relevant facts and circumstances.  Allowing the appeal, the bench said: "While an order granting a stay of arrest in a proceeding under Section 482 of the CrPC lies within the jurisdiction of the High Court, the grant of such relief must be after a judicious application of mind, which must emerge from the reasons which are recorded by the Judge. The formulation of reasons in a judicial order provides the backbone of public confidence in the sanctity of the judicial process. While directing that the proceedings are to be listed on a future date, the High Court is undoubtedly not expected to deliver a detailed judgment elaborating upon reasons why a stay of arrest has been granted. But the reasons recorded by the Court must reflect an application of mind to relevant facts and circumstances, including: (i) The nature and gravity of the allegations; (ii) The seriousness of the alleged offence(s); (iii) The position of the accused and the likelihood of their availability for investigation; and (iv) The basis on which a stay of arrest has been granted till the next date."                 
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Thursday dismissed a plea requiring BCCI to initiate the process of amendment of constitution of J&K Cricket Association and to hold fresh elections of the body. It was alleged that the present office bearers of JKCA are guilty of disobedience of a judicial order directing removal of 3 office bearers over conflict of interest. A bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Tashi Rabstan and Justice Puneet Gupta dismissed the plea as non-maintainable, stating that it was a miscellaneous application filed in a disposed of case. The bench reiterated that when proceedings stand terminated by final disposal of writ petition, it is not open to the Court to reopen the proceedings by means of a miscellaneous application, particularly in respect of a matter, which provide a fresh cause of action.  The respondents had submitted that the application was filed by persons who were not party to the original petition and is thus not maintainable. It was further argued that application can be filed in a disposed off matter under 67(2) of the High Court Rules but that application can be filed only by the parties to the petition for correction in case of any typographical error only in the original judgment. That was not the case here.  Adjudicating upon the matter the bench noted,  "Certainly, the applicants are seeking fresh directions in the application including fixing of timeline for amendment of the constitution of Jammu & Kashmir Cricket Association and holding its elections as is clear from the prayer made in the application", further adding "that no miscellaneous application could be filed in a writ petition after its disposal as the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the application as no proceedings are pending before it".  Buttressing the said position of law the bench placed reliance on Ghanasyam Mishra and sons Private Limited Vs. Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company Limited and others reported as  (SC) 771 wherein the Supreme court deprecated the practice of indirectly seeking review of the orders of the Court by filing applications either seeking modification or clarification of the orders.  Rejecting the contention of the petitioner that the court was competent to invoke its powers under Section 151 CPC the bench observed that powers under the said provision cannot be resorted to when there is no lis pending before the Court.  Case Title : Desh Rattan Dubey Vs Board of Cricket Control In India.  Coram : Acting Chief Justice Tashi Rabstan & Justice Puneet Gupta  Counsel For Petitioner : Mr Parveen Kapahi.  Counsel For Respondent : Mr Parimoksh Sethi, Mr Rahul Pant, Mr Rajat Gupta                      
Punjab and Haryana High Court recently came across a case where the original order of conviction passed by the Trial Court was modified under the signature of the Reader of the Court, during the pendency of an appeal preferred by the convict against the said judgment, thereby enhancing the sentence of the convict from 2 months to two years.  The bench comprising Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan noted that all the convicts were originally convicted under section 323/326/120-B IPC read with section 149 IPC. However, due to a typographical mistake, offence under Section 323 was mentioned twice and offence under Section 326 IPC was not mentioned in the column of conviction. Accordingly, the trial court resorted the provisions of section 362 CrPC as per which, a clerical or arithmetical error can be corrected. However, it was brought to the Court's attention that in the corrections made in the original order, which was signed by the Magistrate, the sentence was enhanced to rigorous imprisonment for 2 years. This was done under the signatures of Reader of the Court and not the Magistrate. The Petitioner argued that once the Judicial Magistrate has passed the order on sentence, the corrections in the original judgment, if any, was to be done under the signatures of the Judicial Magistrate only, though it will be a debatable issue whether subsequent to passing of any judgment, the same Judicial Magistrate can enhance the sentence from 02 months to 02 years. Therefore, the instant petition was moved for setting aside the order whereby during the pendency of the appeal, the judgment passed by the trial Court, was amended and modified.  The court in this case held that it requires an inquiry to know as to how the corrections were made under the signatures of the Reader of the Court concerned, thereby enhancing the sentence, though, in the original order, it was only directed to correct the typographical mistake.  Though all these points need to be decided by the Sessions Judge, Tarn Taran, who herself is administrative head of the Sessions Division, Tarn Taran and on the face of it, it requires an inquiry as to how the corrections were made under the signatures of the Reader of the Court concerned, thereby enhancing the sentence, though in the original order, passed by the trial Court, it was only directed that instead of Section 323 IPC, which is mentioned at two places, Section 326 IPC be substituted at one place and there was no such direction to enhance the sentence from 02 months to 02 years.  Therefore, keeping in view the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is directed that the lower appellate Court will allow the amendment in the grounds of appeal assailing to the aforesaid order and after conducting an inquiry on the administrative side will decide the appeal in accordance with the law.  Court finally concluded that while deciding the appeal, the lower appellate Court will also record the findings on whether in terms of Section 362 Cr.P.C., such modification was permissible under law or not. Hence, Prayer in this petition stands amended and modified.  Case Title : Gurmahabir Singh v. State of Punjab   
The Supreme Court observed that a separate bail application need not be insisted while considering the application under Section 88, 170, 204 and 209 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. "There need not be any insistence of a bail application while considering the application under Section 88, 170, 204 and 209 of the Code", a bench comprising Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh ordered. Section 88 deals with the power to take bond for appearance : When any person for whose appearance or arrest the officer presiding in any Court is empowered to issue a summons or warrant, is present in such Court, such officer may require such person to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for his appearance in such Court, or any other Court to which the case may be transferred for trial. Section 170 is about cases to be sent to Magistrate when evidence is sufficient.: If, upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to the officer in charge of the police station that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground as aforesaid, such officer shall forward the accused under custody to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence upon a police report and to try the accused or commit him for trial, or, if the offence is bailable and the accused is able to give security, shall take security from him for his appearance before such Magistrate on a day fixed and for his attendance from day to day before such Magistrate until otherwise directed. Section 204 and 209 of the Code deals with Issue of process and Commitment of case to Court of Session when offence is triable exclusively by it.  Non-bailable warrants not to be issued as a matter of course When the courts seek the attendance of a person, either a summons or a warrant is to be issued depending upon the nature and facts governing the case. Section 87 gives the discretion to the court to issue a warrant, either in lieu of or in addition to summons. The exercise of the aforesaid power can only be done after recording of reasons. A warrant can be either bailable or non-bailable. Section 88 of the Code empowers the Court to take a bond for appearance of a person with or without sureties.Considering the aforesaid two provisions, courts will have to adopt the procedure in issuing summons first, thereafter a bailable warrant, and then a non-bailable warrant may be issued, if so warranted, as held by this Court in Inder Mohan Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal, (2007) 12 SCC 1. Despite the aforesaid clear dictum, we notice that non-bailable warrants are issued as a matter of course without due application of mind and against the tenor of the provision, which merely facilitates a discretion, which is obviously to be exercised in favour of the person whose attendance is sought for, particularly in the light of liberty enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. Therefore, valid reasons have to be given for not exercising discretion in favour of the said person.  For due compliance of Section 170 of the Code, there is no need for filing of a bail application On Section 170 CrPC , the bench referred to Siddharth v. State of U.P., (2021) 1 SCC 676 and observed thus: "This is a power which is to be exercised by the court after the completion of the investigation by the agency concerned. Therefore, this is a procedural compliance from the point of view of the court alone, and thus the investigating agency has got a limited role to play. In a case where the prosecution does not require custody of the accused, there is no need for an arrest when a case is sent to the magistrate under Section 170 of the Code. There is not even a need for filing a bail application, as the accused is merely forwarded to the court for the framing of charges and issuance of process for trial. If the court is of the view that there is no need for any remand, then the court can fall back upon Section 88 of the Code and complete the formalities required to secure the presence of the accused for the commencement of the trial. Of course, there may be a situation where a remand may be required, it is only in such cases that the accused will have to be heard. Therefore, in such a situation, an opportunity will have to be given to the accused persons, if the court is of the prima facie view that the remand would be required. We make it clear that we have not said anything on the cases in which the accused persons are already in custody, for which, the bail application has to be decided on its own merits. Suffice it to state that for due compliance of Section 170 of the Code, there is no need for filing of a bail application. " Issuing a warrant may be an exception (Section 204 CrPC) Section 204 of the Code speaks of issue of process while commencing the proceeding before the Magistrate. Sub-section (1)(b) gives a discretion to a Magistrate qua a warrant case, either to issue a warrant or a summons. As this provision gives a discretion, and being procedural in nature, it is to be exercised as a matter of course by following the prescription of Section 88 of the Code. Thus, issuing a warrant may be an exception in which case the Magistrate will have to give reasons. Section 209 of the Code pertains to commitment of a case to a Court of Sessions by the Magistrate when the offence is triable exclusively by the said court. Sub-sections (a) and (b) of Section 209 of the Code give ample power to the Magistrate to remand a person into custody during or until the conclusion of the trial. Since the power is to be exercised by the Magistrate on a case-to-case basis, it is his wisdom in either remanding an accused or granting bail. Even here, it is judicial discretion which the Magistrate has to exercise. As we have already dealt with the definition of bail, which in simple parlance means a release subject to the restrictions and conditions, a Magistrate can take a call even without an application for bail if he is inclined to do so. In such a case he can seek a bond or surety, and thus can take recourse to Section 88. However, if he is to remand the case for the reasons to be recorded, then the said person has to be heard. Here again, we make it clear that there is no need for a separate application and Magistrate is required to afford an opportunity and to pass a speaking order on bail. Section 436A CrPC The Court noted that, under Section 436A CrPC, when a person has undergone detention for a period extending to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offense, he shall be released by the court on his personal bond with or without sureties.  "The word 'shall' clearly denotes the mandatory compliance of this provision. We do feel that there is not even a need for a bail application in a case of this nature particularly when the reasons for delay are not attributable against the accused. We are also conscious of the fact that while taking a decision the public prosecutor is to be heard, and the court, if it is of the view that there is a need for continued detention longer than one-half 55 of the said period, has to do so. However, such an exercise of power is expected to be undertaken sparingly being an exception to the general rule.", the bench said.

The Allahabad High Court has reiterated that a person against whom a warrant has been issued and, is absconding or concealing himself in order to avoid execution of warrants and proceedings under Section 82 of the Code have been initiated against him, is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail.  The bench of Justice Manju Rani Chauhan observed thus while denying anticipatory bail to three persons (father-in-law, mother-in-law, and wife of the deceased) accused of abetting the suicide of a man.  The Court denied them the relief of anticipatory bail after noting that the applicants/accused were not available for interrogation and investigation and the proceedings under Section 82 CrPC have been initiated against them and non-bailable warrants issued against them.  To reach to this conclusion, the Court relied upon Apex Court’s rulings in the case of Sadhna Chaudhary Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr., reported in 2022 (237) AIC 205 (SC) and Prem Shankar Prasad vs. The State of Bihar and another LL 2021 SC 579.  The case in brief  The case was registered against the applicants accused last year accusing them of torturing the deceased physically, mentally and economically and abetting him to commit suicide, due to which, the deceased committed suicide on June 16, 2022, by jumping from the Yamuna Bridge.  After being booked under Section 306 IPC, they moved to the High Court seeking anticipatory bail on the ground that they have been falsely implicated in the case due to ulterior motives.  In fact, it was submitted that applicant no. 3 (wife of the deceased) was being tortured by the family of the deceased in connection with their demand for dowry, and she was forced to leave her matrimonial house.  It was further argued that there is no credible evidence against the applicants to show that there is abetment from the side of the applicants instigating the deceased to commit suicide.   On the other hand, the A.G.A. as well as counsel for the informant argued that the Investigating Officer has checked the call details of the deceased Akash, collected the suicide note, recorded the statements of the independent witness, which go to show the involvement of the applicants in the present case.   It was also submitted that from the suicide note, it is clear that applicants no.1 &2 have been held responsible for harassing the deceased to such an extent that they did not permit the deceased to meet his child, which amounts to abetment.   Lastly, it was submitted as per the report of S.S.P., Prayagraj, the court below has issued Non-bailable Warrants and initiated the proceedings under Section 82 Cr.P.C. against the applicants, which goes to show that the applicants are not cooperating in the and thus, they should not be granted bail.  Taking into account the submissions of the Counsels for both the parties and the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the Court refused to grant them anticipatory bail by observing thus:  “…looking to the facts and circumstances of this case, submissions of learned counsel for the parties, taking into consideration the role assigned to the applicant as per prosecution case, gravity and nature of accusation as well as reasons mentioned above, this court is of the view that no case for exercising its discretionary power under section 438 Code of Criminal Procedure is made out in favour of applicant”  Appearances  Counsel for Applicant: Niraj Kumar Dwivedi, Adya Prasad Tewari, Pradip Kumar Singh Counsel for Opposite Party: G.A., Rajesh Kumar Roy Sharma  Case title - Anand Shankar Pandey And 2 Others vs. State Of U.P And Another [CRIMINAL MISC ANTICIPATORY BAIL APPLICATION U/S 438 CR.P.C.

The Allahabad High Court on Friday expressed its displeasure over the ongoing strike by the Uttar Pradesh electricity department employees despite the court's December 2022 order that the power supply should not be disrupted due to the strike by the employees. Issuing contempt proceedings against the Employees' Association and its office bearers, the bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Vinod Diwaker observed that even if there is a substance in the demand raised by the workers, yet, the entire State cannot be put to severe constraints by jeopardizing overwhelming public interest.  "Such act of workers violates the direction of this court for not disrupting power supply. Even national interest is compromised on account of the reduction in the generation of power in different power-generating units of the State. Thus, Prima facie disobedience of this court's order dated 06.12.2022 is indicated," the Court further remarked. With this, considering the urgency of the matter, the High Court issued bailable warrants against the office bearers of the Vidyut Karmachari Sanyukt Sangarsh Samiti (VKSSS) by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow requiring their presence before the court at 10 am on March 20.  The warrants were issued as the court noted that despite serving of notices upon the Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti through the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow, none had entered an appearance on their behalf, in the petition, till now It may be noted that the 27 lacs electricity workers in the State went on a three-day strike on March 16 night which led to the disruption of the power supply across the state. The situation was apprised to the Court that the strikes are in violation of the court's December 6, 2022 order that the power supply not be disrupted.  It may be noted that the HC's December 2022 order was made upon being apprised of the disruption of power supply in Prayagraj, on account of a strike by the employees of State Power/Electricity Units. Cognizance was also taken with regard to similar disruption in other districts of the State, later and several directions were issued by the Court. Now, on March 17, when the matter was mentioned before the Court that the strikes have been called due to which the power supply is disrupted, the Court took up the matter and made some stern remarks.  Before the Court, copies of newspaper reports were also filed before the Court to show that even in the Electricity Sub-Station which caters to the High Court Premises also, there are no employees available and it is the Magistrate and police personnel who are guarding the Sub-Station and managing the supply of electricity.  The Court was also informed that the Board Examinations are going on in almost all districts of the State and the strike call by the Employees' Union, contrary to the directions issued in the present PIL not only violates the orders passed in the present petition but has the effect of virtually obstructing all spheres of activity in the State of Uttar Pradesh including the working of courts. It was also urged that on account of the strike call the generation of power in Anpara and Obra units of Thermal Power Corporation has also been severely curtailed. The employees of the Electricity Department are also not available in the State Load Dispatch Centre, which controls the power grid. Against the backdrop of these submissions, calling it a serious situation requiring an immediate attention, the bench, finding the act of employees in violation of the court's order, observed thus: "Since the Employees' Association has not entered appearance despite the previous orders passed by this Court and service of notice upon it, we are left with no option but to issue notices to the Employees' Association and its office bearers for initiation of contempt proceedings against them." Further, the State authorities were also directed to ensure that appropriate action as may be permissible in law be taken against the erring officials/employees so as to ensure compliance with the previous orders passed by this court on 06.12.2022, and report compliance with the action taken in the matter by then.

The Karnataka High Court has said that once the court accepts the complaint filed under section 200 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and directs particular police to investigate, the police cannot decline to investigate.  A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna while allowing the petition filed by one Ashwini set aside the order of the endorsement dated 26.08.2021, issued by the Police and directed the police to investigate and file a final report in the matter as directed by the IX Additional Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, on 14.07.2021.  Case Details:  The petitioner on certain allegations registered a private complaint under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore, seeking investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. The complaint was presented in the open Court, the office was directed to register the case as PCR and the same was registered.  Further, the Magistrate heard the counsel for the complainant, perused the records and ordered investigation to be conducted by the jurisdictional police – Jnanabharathi Police Station and to submit a final report in the matter by his order dated 18.10.2021.  On the communication of the said complaint to the jurisdictional Police, an endorsement was issued by the respondent - Jnanabharathi Police Station that the jurisdiction lies with Byadarahalli Police and therefore, sought to transfer the complaint from Jnanabharathi Police Station, who was directed to investigate, to Byadarahalli Police Station.  Thereafter, a notice was issued to the petitioner and the complaint was returned to the petitioner for want of jurisdiction to investigate the offence, as according to the Police, the jurisdiction lied with Byadarahalli Police. It is this action that was called in question in the subject petition.  Submissions:  Advocate Trivikram S for the petitioner submitted that the action of the respondent-Police in refusing to investigate the matter and file a final report as directed by the Court would amount to sitting over the order of a Court and therefore, is illegal. Further he said that once the order of the Magistrate was set in motion, the same cannot be recalled even by the Magistrate himself, let alone returning of the complaint by the Police. The government pleader admitted the legal position and submitted that the matter is to be investigated by the respondent - police.  Court findings:  The bench on going through the details on record and arguments advanced by the counsel said, "The police refusing to conduct investigation and returning the complaint would on the face of it amount to overriding the orders of the Court, which jurisdiction the police do not possess."  It added, "Once the Court accepts the complaint and directs particular police to investigate, declining to investigate such cases, cannot arise. The police ought to have investigated and filed its final report in the matter. Returning of the complaint after the same having been accepted and investigation directed, that too by the police, runs counter to Section 173 of the Cr.P.C."  Following which it allowed the petition.  Case Title: Ashwini v.

Dismissing activist Umar Khalid's bail appeal in the larger conspiracy case of Northeast Delhi riots, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday said revolution by itself isn't always bloodless and that is why a prefix - bloodless, is used with the term 'bloodless revolution'. "This court is reminded of that although, the activity of 'revolution' in its essential quality may not be different but from the point of view of Robespierre and Pandit Nehru, in its potentiality and in its effect upon public tranquillity there can be a vast difference," said the division bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar. During the hearing of Khalid's bail appeal in May, Khalid had been questioned by the judges for his Amravati speech of February 2020 and more particularly the words used in reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by him. What also had piqued the interest of the judges was the use of terms "inquilabli salam" (revolutionary salute) and "krantikari istiqbal" (revolutionary welcome) at the beginning of his speech as a greeting to invite the spirit of revolution. Addressing Senior Advocate Trideep Pais, who represented Khalid, Justice Mridul had also asked him to look at what French lawyer and statesman Maximilien Robespierre had to say about revolution. Pais had argued that revolution can be non-violent also, and submitted there was no immediate violence after his speech. In the judgement written by Justice Bhatnagar, the court on Tuesday said it was not impressed by the argument as the call to revolution does not have to affect only the immediate gathering. "The call to revolution may affect many beyond those who were visibly present, which is why this court finds it apt to mention Robespierre, who was at the vanguard of the French revolution. This court is of the view that possibly, if the appellant had referred to Maximilien Robespierre for what he meant by revolution, he must have also known what revolution meant for our freedom fighter & first prime minister," said the bench. The court added that that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru believed that democracy has made revolution superfluous after independence and how it meant the complete opposite of a bloodless change. "Revolution by itself isn't always bloodless, which is why it is contradistinctly used with the prefix - a 'bloodless' revolution. So, when we use the expression 'revolution', it is not necessarily bloodless," said the court.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that before deciding to drop proceedings in a criminal complaint, the Court has to be satisfied that the subject matter involved in the complaint is a purely civil wrong and that it has no criminal texture to it. The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged order of Municipal Magistrate, Jammu dismissing his criminal complaint in exercise of powers under Section 203 CrPC and the order of Additional Sessions Judge, Jammu which dismissed the revision petition filed against Magistrate's dismissal order. The petitioner contended that the contents of the complaint clearly disclose commission of criminal offence against the respondents, inasmuch as the offence of criminal breach of trust and forgery are disclosed against them. It was further argued that provision of alternative mechanism for redressal of any dispute does not ipso-facto absolve a person from criminal liability and that mere presence of civil element in a criminal offence does not mean that no offence is made out.  The criminal complaint was filed after a building agreement went sour. The complaint filed for offences under Sections 406/ 409/ 481/ 420/ 467/ 468/ 120-B RPC alleged that the Petitioner was to be awarded certain tenancy rights, however, the respondents dishonestly shifted the tenancy rights without the knowledge of the complainant.  The Courts below held that the dispute is in the realm of civil dispute for which remedy is available in the agreement executed between the parties and as such, criminal proceedings cannot lie against the respondents.  Deciding the matter in controversy, Justice Dhar observed that there can be no dispute to the fact that merely because a particular act of a person gives rise to civil liability against another person does not mean that no criminal proceedings can be initiated against such person.  In order to explain the law on the subject the bench placed firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in M/s Indian Oil Corporation v. M/s NEPC India Ltd. and others (2006) 6 SCC 736 wherein SC observed,  "A given set of facts may make out: (a) purely a civil wrong; or (b) purely a criminal offence; or (c) a civil wrong as also a criminal offence. A commercial transaction or a contractual dispute, apart from furnishing a cause of action for seeking remedy in civil law, may also involve a criminal offence. As the nature and scope of a civil proceedings are different from a criminal proceeding, the mere fact that the complaint relates to a commercial transaction or breach of contract, for which a civil remedy is available or has been availed, is not by itself a ground to quash the criminal proceedings. The test is whether the allegations in the complaint disclose a criminal offence or not."  Applying the position of law in vogue on the matter, the bench went on to analyse the offences alleged in the complaint and held that it is clear that the transaction between the petitioner and respondent No.1 is purely of civil nature and it has been given a criminal colour by the petitioner/complainant, which is impermissible in law and hence the trial Magistrate was justified in dismissing the complaint by exercising his powers under Section 203 CrPC.  Accordingly, the bench dismissed the petition.  Case Title: Bahu Builders and Traders Jammu Pvt. Ltd Vs J&K Dharmarth Trust and others.              
The Rajasthan High Court has quashed and set aside conviction of five accused persons for allegedly forming an unlawful assembly and causing injuries/ murder, observing that the incident was nothing but a "freeThe Division Bench comprising Justices Rameshwar Vyas and Sandeep Mehta observed,"We have no hesitation in holding that the ingredients required to constitute an unlawful assembly... The Rajasthan High Court has quashed and set aside conviction of five accused persons for allegedly forming an unlawful assembly and causing injuries/ murder, observing that the incident was nothing but a "free The Division Bench comprising Justices Rameshwar Vyas and Sandeep Mehta observed, "We have no hesitation in holding that the ingredients required to constitute an unlawful assembly are totally lacking in this case and hence, the implication of accused persons by virtue of Section 149 IPC is unwarranted and unsustainable".  Taking note of the facts of the case and the circumstances that led to an altercation between the complainants and the accused, it added, "the incident has all trappings of a free-fight between the two parties without there being any motive for the accused to launch an assault with the intention to commit murder of any person from the complainant party." The court, however, upheld their conviction under Section 323 IPC for voluntarily causing hurt. Three of the accused were also convicted under Section 325 for causing grievous hurt and two were convicted under Section 302 for Murder of one. Background The accused, being aggrieved of their conviction and sentences by the Trial Court, had preferred an appeal under Section 374(2) Cr.P.C The facts of this case are based on the allegations made by the complainant. He alleged that appellants threatened to take revenge against Rawalram (PW.5), by killing him, on the premise that he had given out their names in an incident involving assault on a roadways' bus driver. The complainant alleged that when he along with Rawalram were sitting around a Kirana Store, the appellants, armed with weapons, launched an assault on Rawalram with the intention of killing him. Meanwhile, other witnesses of this case also intervened and got injured.  Thereafter, an FIR was filed, however, one Kishanram who was also involved in the brawl died. Accordingly, the five accused were convicted for offences punishable under Sections 148, 323/149, 325/149 and 302/149 of IPC.  After thoroughly analyzing the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, defence witnesses and medical experts, the High Court ruled that the present incident has all trappings of a free-fight between the two parties without there being any motive for the accused to launch an assault with the intention to commit murder of any person from the complainant party.  The court ruled this while observing that the altercation started outside at a Kirana Store where both the sides started fighting with each other. During the melee, the deceased Kishanram and the injured prosecution witness-Virendra ran towards the Meera Nagar lane. It is alleged that the accused also followed and the fight continued.  The court added that as per the admitted prosecution case, assault was initiated by the accused persons on Rawalram (PW.5), while Kishanram (the deceased) and Virendra (PW.4) came to the spot, subsequently as interveners.  The court further added that after interveners arrived at the spot, the parties ran towards Meera Nagar lane and continued the fight. "Manifestly, thus, only Virendra (PW.4) could have witnessed the incident, wherein Kishanaram was beaten up because Virendra (PW.4) also sustained injuries in the same process", observed the court.  The court observed that as per the pertinent allegation, injuries were inflicted to Kishanaram with iron rods by Madhuram and Jetharam. Tarachand allegedly inflicted blows with iron pipe to Virendra, who in his testimony did not utter a single word that anyone other than these three accused persons were present at the spot where Kishanaram was assaulted. In furtherance of this, the court held that the involvement of the accused Tarachand, Pannaram, Sumer, Birmaram and Madanlal in this case by invoking Section 149 IPC is totally unjustified.  The court observed that the case of the accused Madhuram and Jetharam is covered by clauses firstly and thirdly of Section 300 IPC and does not fall within any of the exceptions to Section 300 IPC.  The court, therefore, ruled that as far as the accused Madhuram and Jetharam are concerned, their conviction as recorded by the trial court for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC is absolutely justified and need not be toned down. Case Title: Madhuram and Ors v. State of Rajasthan, with connected matter      
In her dissenting judgment in the pleas challenging demonetisation, Supreme Court judge Justice BV Nagarathna observed that there was no independent application of mind by the Reserve Bank of India in recommending the cancellation of entire Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes as proposed by the Central Government. Justice Nagarathna formed this opinion after referring to the records relating to the decision submitted by the Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India.  "On looking at the records( submitted by RBI), I find the use of the words and phrases there "as desired by the Central Govt", "Govt has recommended the withdrawal of legal tender of 500 and 1000 notes", "recommendation has been obtained" etc., are self explanatory. This demonstrates that there was no independent application of mind by the (Reserve) Bank. Neither was there any time for the bank to apply its mind in such a serious issue. This observation is being made having regard to the fact that the entire exercise of demonetisation of all series of bank notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 was carried out in 24 hours", Justice Nagarathna observed. Justice Nagarathna noted that the proposal originated from the Central Government by way of its letter dated 7 November 2016 addressed to the bank. The recommendation did not originate from the bank under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act but was obtained from the bank by the Central Government. A proposal originating from the Central Government is not akin to a proposal originating from the Central Board of the Bank. Justice Nagarathna opined that the concurrence given by the RBI to such a proposal cannot be construed as a "recommendation" under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act. Even assuming for argument sake that the RBI had such a power, Justice Nagarathna held that such a recommendation is void as the power under Section 26(2) can be only for a particular series of currency notes & not for the whole series of currency notes of a denomination. The judge opined that the word "any series" in Section 26(2) of the RBI Act cannot be interpreted to mean "all series" as held by the majority. Demonetisation of all series of notes at the instance of Central Govt is a far more serious issue than the demonetisation of particular series by the bank. So, it has to be done through legislation than through executive notification, she held. "Parliament is a miniature of the country.... Parliament which is the centre of democracy cannot be left aloof in a matter of such critical importance", Justice Nagarathna observed in the judgment. Justice Nagarathna further observed: "The problems associated with the measure of demonetisation would make one wonder whether the Central Board of the Bank visualised the consequences which would follow. Whether the central board of the bank had attempted to take note of the adverse effects of the demonetisation of such a large volume of bank notes in circulation. The objectives of the central board may have been sound, just and proper. But the manner in which the said objects were achieved and the procedure followed were not in accordance with law". "It has also been brought on record that around 98% of the value of the demonetised currency notes have been exchanged for bank notes which continues to be a legal tender. Also a new series of bank notes for Rs 2000 was released by the bank. This would suggest the measure itself was may not have been proved to be as effective as it was hoped to be. However, this court does not base its decision on the legality of a legislation qua the effectiveness in achieving the stated objectives. Therefore, it is clarified that any relief moulded in the present case is divorced from the consideration of the success of such measures", she said.  "The opinion of the Central Bank ought to be a frank and independent opinion, after a meaningful discussion with the central board, which ought to be given its true weightage, having regard to the ramifications on the Indian economy and the citizens of India", the judge observed. Even if the RBI recommends such an action, the Central Government cannot demonetise the entire series of currency notes through an executive notification. It has to be done through a legislative process- either through a law made by the Parliament or an ordinance. Based on the above reasons, Justice Nagarathna declared the notification dated November 8, 2016 to be "contrary to law" and "unlawful". "In the circumstances, the action of demonetisation of all currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 is vitiated. Further, the subsequent Ordinance of 2016 and the Act of 2017, incorporating the terms of the impugned notification, are unlawful. However, having regard to the fact that the impugned notification and the Act have been acted upon, the declaration of law will apply prospectively and will not affect any action taken by the Central Government or the RBI pursuant to the notification dated November 8, 2016. Hence, no relief is being granted in the individual petitions". Justice Nagarathna however added that the measure was well-intentioned to target evils plaguing the nation's economy such as black money, terror funding and counterfeit currency. "Before parting, I wish to observe that demonetisation was an initiative of the Central Government, targeted to address disparate evils, plaguing the Nation’s economy, including, practices of hoarding “black” money, counterfeiting, which in turn enable even greater evils, including terror funding, drug trafficking, emergence of a parallel economy, money laundering including Havala transactions. It is beyond the pale of doubt that the said measure, which was aimed at eliminating these depraved practices, was well-­intentioned. The measure is reflective of concern for the economic health and security of the country and demonstrates foresight. At no point has any suggestion been made that the measure was motivated by anything but the best intentions and noble objects for the betterment of the Nation. The measure has been regarded as unlawful only on a purely legalistic analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act and not on the objects of demonetisation".

Police officers are not required to do moral policing, observed the Supreme Court recently while upholding the dismissal of a CISF personnel who was found to have harassed a couple at night. The Court was deciding an appeal filed by the Central Industrial Security Force against a judgment of the Gujarat High Court which directed the reinstatement of a CISF officer named Sathosh Kumar Pandey, who was dismissed from service for misconduct. In 2001, while Pandey was posted as a constable on night duty at the Greenbelt Area of the IPCL Township, Vadodara, Gujarat, he happened to see a colleague of his travelling in a motorbike with his fiancee as the pillion rider at about 1 AM. Pandey intercepted the couple -who were proceeding to watch a Garba performance- and asked his colleague if he "could spend some time" with his fiancée. He also demanded something in return for allowing the couple to pass, and his colleague had to give his watch to Pandey. Following a complaint, departmental enquiry was conducted against Pandey, which resulted in his dismissal from service. The woman also gave her statement to the enquiry officer. Though she said that she could not hear the conversation between her fiancee and Pandey, she stated that she had seen Pandey taking the watch.  However, in a challenge made by Pandey, the Gujarat High Court interfered with the punishment, and directed his reinstatement with 50% backwages. The CISF approached the Supreme Court against the High Court's judgment. A bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and JK Maheshwari took exception to the High Court judgment by saying "it fails to take notice and properlyapply the law of judicial review".  "The conclusions of fact, which are based upon evaluation and appreciation of evidence, when meticulously reached by the authorities, should not be interfered with merely because the court may have reached at a different conclusion", the Top Court observed. The Court also said that the statement of the woman cannot be regarded as exonerating the officer, just because she said she had not heard the conversation. "She was a young girl and it is obvious would have felt anxious and awkward. It is understandable as she would not have liked being subjected to personal and private questions. These are facts of life that have to be accounted for when we evaluate and pass judgments. A holistic and pragmatic approach is required, especially when the Evidence Act is not applicable; and even where the Evidence Act applies, the enactment gives discretion on matters of evaluation, analysis and appraisal of evidence". As regards the proportionality of the punishment, the Supreme Court said that the facts of the case are "startling and distressing".   "We have to observe that the facts in the present case are startling and distressing. Respondent No. 1 – Santosh Kumar Pandey is not a police officer, and even police officers are not required to do moral policing, ask for physical favour or material goods". The High Court judgment was set aside and the punishment of dismissal was restored. Case Title : CISF and others vs Santosh Kumar Pandey For Appellant(s) Mr. Arvind Kumar Sharma, AOR  For Respondent(s) Mr. Rakesh Uttamchandra Upadhyay, AOR Headnotes  Summary - Supreme Court upholds dismissal of a CISF personnel who was found to have harassed a couple at night - Condemns moral policing by police. Service Law - Interference with disciplinary proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution -The writ court, when disciplinary action is challenged, is primarily concerned with examination of the decision making process, which requires satisfaction that the competent authorities have held inquiry as per the prescribed procedure, and have duly applied their mind to the evidence and material placed on record, without extraneous matters being given undue consideration, and the relevant factors have been cogitated. The conclusions of fact, which are based upon evaluation and appreciation of evidence, when meticulously reached by the authorities, should not be interfered with merely because the court may have reached at a different conclusion - Para 17 Constitution of India -Article 226- Judicial review is not akin to adjudication of the case on merits, and adequacy or inadequacy of evidence, unless the court finds that the findings recorded are based on no evidence, perverse or are legally untenable in the sense that it fails to pass the muster of the Wednesbury principles. Power of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India enables exercise of judicial review to correct errors of law, including procedural law, leading to manifest injustice or violation of principles of fairness, without normally venturing into reappreciation of evidence   
The Jaipur bench of Rajasthan High Court, while relying on Sections 23, 47 and 74 of Registration Act, 1908, reiterated that registration of sale deed shall operate from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made, and not from the time of its registration. Essentially, petitioner applied for selection... The Jaipur bench of Rajasthan High Court, while relying on Sections 23, 47 and 74 of Registration Act, 1908, reiterated that registration of sale deed shall operate from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made, and not from the time of its registration.  Essentially, petitioner applied for selection conducted by respondent-IOCL for retail outlet dealership and allotment of petrol pump at location at Jhalawar and the last date for submitting its application form was 12/01/2019. He got a certificate from the office of Sub-Registrar, Dug on 19/03/2019 which specifies the factum of sale deed being presented for registration on 11/01/2019 and the reasoning for non-execution of the same on the said date on account of the server being down and thereafter there being public holidays, the same got registered on 15/01/2019.  Later, on 13/03/2019, the petitioner's application was rejected for Group-1 but it was directed for consideration under Group-3 as per guidelines. On 20/03/2019, the petitioner apprised about it to the respondents and filed documents with them within required time of 10 days of the letter dated 14/01/2019. Being aggrieved, he filed a writ petition before the court.  Justice Sameer Jain, while allowing the plea, ruled,  "The prayers made by the petitioner in the present writ petition appear to be justified and the impugned action of the respondents communicated by them to the petitioner vide their letter/email dt.13/03/2019 in not considering the case of the petitioner for retail outlet under Group-1 is held to be unjustified. The respondents are accordingly directed to consider the claim of the petitioner for allotment of retail outlet under the category of Group-1 and proceed further."  The court observed that as per Section 23 of the Registration Act, 1908, four months' time is provided for acceptance of registration qua the sale deed and as per Section 74 enquiry can be conducted. The court added that as per Section 47, it is specifically provided that a registration shall operate from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made, and not from the time of its registration.  Placing reliance on Hamda Ammal v. Avadiappa Pathar & Ors. [(1991) 1 SCC 715], the court negated the arguments of respondents and observed that as much as within a time frame of four months, a sale deed can be presented for registration.The court noted that as per Section 23, after submitting the sale deed for registration with the registration office, the same can be considered for enquiry and as per Section 47, the act of registration is not bound to operate but it is a time from which it would have commenced to operate.  The court pursued the facts and noted that on 11/01/2019, the sale deed commenced to operate, the petitioner's father has taken possession of the said land, paid consideration qua the same to the seller, deposited adequate stamp duty along with prescribed form in the office of Sub-Registrar, Dug and as the server of Sub-Registrar's office was down on the date of presentation of sale deed for registration on 11/01/2019 and thereafter there were public holidays for three days, the sale deed was registered on 15/01/2019 and the same was submitted within the prescribed time of ten days as provided by the respondents.  It was, however, observed by the court that as per Sections 9 and 10 of the General Clauses Act, computation of time and manner of computation excludes the date of filing when there are public holidays.  Further, the court observed that a similar view was also considered by Gujarat High Court in Indian Oil Corporation Vs. Ranjitsinh Jitusinh Zala, wherein it was held that the date of effect of sale deed will be its presentation and not issuance of registration in terms of Section 47 of the Registration Act, 1908 and the guidelines of the Oil Companies cannot override the Act of the Parliament. This decision was also affirmed by the Apex Court, added the court.  The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the registered document shall operate from the time when the same is commenced to operate or has been executed and not from the date of registration/issuance by the authority concerned. As per Section 23 of the Registration Act, a document of the nature of sale deed specifies time of four months from the date of its execution, he added. He further submitted that Section 74 of the Registration Act, 1908 permits enquiry to be performed by the competent authority under the Act. Learned counsel has also submitted that Section 54 of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 defines sale as a transfer of ownership when consideration is paid qua the same.  The counsel for the respondent submitted that Section 47 specifies that in cases where the registration is required compulsorily, the date of execution/presentation cannot be considered; the terms and conditions of the guidelines of the Oil Companies are binding upon them as well as the applicant and the same were specified in the document which has been duly accepted by the petitioner.  He contended that once the registration of the document was done on 15/01/2019, the case of the petitioner cannot be considered under Group-1 category as on 12/01/2019, the document in question qua the title of land was unregistered sale deed which is more than enough to debar the petitioner to from considering his case under Group-1 category. Further, the submissions of the documents was falsely made and is an act of misrepresentation, concealment and suppression and on this count alone, the candidature of the petitioner is falsified, he added  Adv. Anuroop Singhi, Adv. Roshan Sharma and Adv. Devansh Sharma appeared for the petitioner, while Adv. Suruchi Kasliwal appeared for the respondents.  Case Title: Chitranshi Goyal v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.    
Opining on the established principle of availability of alternate remedy, the Calcutta High Court on Tuesday observed that a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be filed for adjudicating upon a grievance pertaining to the non-registration of FIR by police authorities on the basis of a complaint made. A Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and... Opining on the established principle of availability of alternate remedy, the Calcutta High Court on Tuesday observed that a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be filed for adjudicating upon a grievance pertaining to the non-registration of FIR by police authorities on the basis of a complaint made.  A Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj observed while dismissing a PIL,  "The grievance is in respect of non-registration of FIR on the basis of the complaint made by the petitioner therefore it is a grievance of personal nature, which cannot be agitated in a PIL. That apart, the writ under Article 226 of the Constitution is not a proper remedy seeking direction to register an FIR or to carry out the investigation." The Court further underscored that if the petitioner has any grievance in respect of non- registration of the FIR or improper investigation, then the proper remedy available to him is to take recourse to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).  Reliance was placed on the Supreme Court judgment in Sakiri Vasu v.. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others wherein the Apex Court had underscored, "We have elaborated on the above matter because we often find that when someone has a grievance that his FIR has not been registered at the police station and/or a proper investigation is not being done by the police, he rushes to the High Court to file a writ petition or a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. We are of the opinion that the High Court should not encourage this practice and should ordinarily refuse to interfere in such matters and relegate the petitioner to his alternating remedy." In the instant case, the petitioner had contended that the authorities of Contai Prabhat Kumar College had made certain defalcations of funds and subsequently he had registered a complaint with the police authorities in this regard. However, it was submitted that no action had been taken by the police authorities on the basis of the complaint made.  Accordingly, a prayer had been in the writ petition to issue directions commanding the respondent authorities to register an FIR and to initiate proper investigation on the basis of the complaint. The petitioner had further prayed for issuance of directions to the Superintendent of Police to initiate an enquiry against the concerned Inspector-in-Charge as to why proceedings should not be initiated against him for not taking action after receiving the complaint. Opining that the petitioner should exhaust the alternative remedies available, the Court dismissed the writ petition.  Case Title: Abu Sohel v. The State West Bengal and others    
The court observed that there was a premeditated and pre-planned conspiracy.While denying bail to Mohd. Ibrahim in Head Constable Ratan Lal Murder Case, the Delhi High Court has observed that the riots which took place in North East Delhi in February 2020 did not take place in a "spur of the moment" and was a "calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the Government as well as to disrupt the normal life".Justice Subramonium Prasad made the... While denying bail to Mohd. Ibrahim in Head Constable Ratan Lal Murder Case, the Delhi High Court has observed that the riots which took place in North East Delhi in February 2020 did not take place in a "spur of the moment"  and was a "calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the Government as well as to disrupt the normal life". Justice Subramonium Prasad made the observation while passing order in connection with murder of Head Constable Ratan Lal and causing head injuries to a DCP during the North-East Delhi riots that rocked the national capital last year. (FIR 60/2020 PS DayalPur).  "The riots which shook the National Capital of the country in February 2020 evidently did not take place in a spur of the moment, and the conduct of the protestors who are present in the video footage which has been placed on record by the prosecution visibly portrays that it was a calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the Government as well as to disrupt the normal life of the people in the city," the Court said. It was also observed that the systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras also confirmed the existence of a "pre-planned and pre-meditated" conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city. "This is also evident from the fact that innumerable rioters ruthlessly descended with sticks, dandas, bats etc. upon a hopelessly outnumbered cohort of police officials," the Court added. The Court also observed that individual liberty cannot be misused in a way that it threatens the fabric of society by attempting to destabilize it or cause hurt to others. "This Court has previously opined on the importance of personal liberty in a democratic polity, but it is to be categorically noted that individual liberty cannot be misused in a manner that threatens the very fabric of civilised society by attempting to destabilise it and cause hurt to other persons," the Court said. Specific allegations against Ibrahim was that he was seen in various CCTV footages wearing a skull cap, black Nehru jacket, and salwar-kurta and was identified on the camera installed by the Delhi Government. The Prosecution's case was that there were three videos which showed that the assault on the police personnel was pre-meditated.  Bail was denied to Ibrahim after the Court opined that although he could not be seen on the crime scene, but was a part of the mob for the sole reason that the he had consciously travelled 1.6 kms away from his neighbourhood with a sword which could only be used to incite violence inflicting damage. "In light of this, the footage of the Petitioner with the sword is quite egregious, and is therefore sufficient to keep the Petitioner in custody," the Court said. The Court had passed the order after reserving it last month. It heard at length various counsels appearing on behalf of the accused persons along with ASG SV Raju and Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad appearing for prosecution. The Court had reserved its order in 11 bail applications filed by different accused persons in the FIR, with today's decision, orders have been passed in all 11 of them. The Court had recently granted bail to Shahnawaz and Mohd Ayyub while denying it to Sadiq and Irshad Ali. The Court had earlier granted bail to 5 accused persons namely Mohd. Arif, Shadab Ahmad, Furkan, Suvaleen and Tabassum earlier this month. About FIR 60/2020 (P.S. DayalPur) FIR 60/2020 was registered on the statement of a Constable stating that on 24th February last year, he was on the law and order arrangement duty with other staff members at Chand Bagh area. It was stated that around 1 PM protesters carrying danda, lathies, baseball bats, iron rods and stones started gathering at the main Wazirabad road and did not pay heed to the directions of senior officers thereby became violent. It was further stated that after repeated warnings to the protestors, mild force and gas shells were used to disperse the crowd. According to the Constable, violent protesters started beating people as well as police personnel, due to which he himself sustained injury on his right elbow and hand. He also stated that the protestors attacked DCP Shahdara, ACP Gokulpuri, and Head Constable Rattan Lal due to which they fell on the road and sustained grievous injuries. All the injured persons were taken to hospital, where it was found that HC Rattan Lal had already died due to injuries sustained and DCP Shahdara was unconscious and had sustained head injuries. Observations On Granting Bail To Shahnawaz and Mohd Ayyub While granting bail to Mohd Ayyub, the Court observed that there was no electronic evidence placing him at the Scene of Crime during the time of the alleged incident. It further observed that he cannot be kept in custody only on the basis of the disclosure statements. "The fourth chargesheet has already been filed, and trial in the matter is likely to take a long time. This Court is of the opinion that it would not be prudent to keep the Petitioner behind bars for an undefined period of time at this stage. The Petitioner has roots in society, and, therefore, there is no danger of him absconding and fleeing," the Court said. While granting bail to Shahnawaz, the Court reiterated the fundamental right to protest and express dissent and opined that the fact that he was part of the protest is not a sufficient ground to refuse bail to him. "Merely being one of the organisers of the protest as well as being in touch with others who participated in the protest is also not sufficient enough to justify the contention that the Petitioner was involved in the pre-planning of the alleged incident," the Court observed. Observations On Denying Bail To Sadiq and Irshad Ali The Court, while denying bail to Irshad Ali, took note of the fact that he was seen in the CCTV footage, carrying a danda and provoking the crowd. "The clinching evidence that tilts this Court to prolong the incarceration of the Petitioner is his presence in the Vishal Chaudhry video wherein he is clearly identified at the Scene of Crime, using a stick to beat uniformed police officials who are present around him," the Court said. The Court was thus of the opinion that the footage of Irshad Ali at the Scene of Crime was quite egregious and therefore sufficient to keep the him in custody. Making similar observations while denying bail to Sadiq, the Court said that he was not merely a curious onlooker. "The fact that he actively participated and pelted stones at the Police Officials at the Scene of Crime justifies the invocation of Section 149 IPC read with Section 302 IPC in the instant case," the Court observed. Court's Observations While Granting Bail To Co Accused Persons In the case of Mohd. Arif, the Court noted that the applicability of Section 149 IPC, specifically read with Section 302, cannot be done on the basis of vague evidence and general allegations. When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the Court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object.  "Bail jurisprudence attempts to bridge the gap between the personal liberty of an accused and ensuring social security remains intact. It is the intricate balance between the securing the personal liberty of an individual and ensuring that this liberty does not lead to an eventual disturbance of public order. It is egregious and against the principles enshrined in our Constitution to allow an accused to remain languishing behind bars during the pendency of the trial. Therefore, the Court, while deciding an application for grant of bail, must traverse this intricate path very carefully and thus take multiple factors into consideration before arriving at a reasoned order whereby it grants or rejects bail," the Court said. It added: "It is the Constitutional duty of the Court to ensure that there is no arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty in the face of excess of State power. Bail is the rule and jail is the exception, and Courts must exercise their jurisdiction to uphold the tenets of personal liberty, subject to rightful regulation of the same by validly enacted legislation. The Supreme Court has time and again held that Courts need to be alive to both ends of the spectrum, i.e. the duty of the Courts to ensure proper enforcement of criminal law, and the duty of the Courts to ensure that the law does not become a tool for targeted harassment". At the outset, the Court observed that applicability of Section 149 IPC, specifically read with Section 302, cannot be done on the basis of vague evidence and general allegations. "When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the Court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object," added the Court. While granting bail to Shadab Ahmad & Tabassum, the Court was of the view that the sole act of protesting should not be employed as a weapon to justify the incarceration of those who are exercising this right.   
The Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered a complete ban on the usage and sale of all kinds of firecrackers including green crackers throughout the State of West Bengal during the upcoming Diwali/Kali Puja festivities.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered a complete ban on the usage and sale of all kinds of firecrackers including green crackers throughout the State of West Bengal during the upcoming Diwali/Kali Puja festivities. Such an order on complete ban of firecrackers shall persist for all remaining festivities this year including Chhath Puja, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Christmas and New Year's celebrations.  A Division Bench comprising Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharya and Aniruddha Roy observed,  "The State should ensure that there is no use or display or bursting of firecrackers of any type at all during the oncoming Kali Puja, Diwali celebration as well as the following Chatt Puja, Jagadhatri Puja, Guru Nanak's Birthday and/or Christmas/New Year's Eve this year. For such purpose, only wax or oil-based diyas might be used"  The Court was adjudicating upon a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition moved by environmental activist Roshni Ali seeking a ban on the sale and use of fire crackers during the upcoming festivities in order to safeguard people's right to clean, healthy and breathable air, particularly in times of the vicious Covid-19 pandemic.  During the course of the hearing, the counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner pointed out to the Court that a Division Bench of the High Court last year in the case of Anasua Bhattacharya v. State of West Bengal & Ors had passed a similar order prohibiting the use or display or bursting of firecrackers during all festivities.  Advocate General SN Mookerjee further highlighted that it is important to protect the fundamental right to life of citizens but maintained that the State had a 'neutral' stand in this respect vis-à-vis the rights of the firecracker manufacturers.  The Court was further apprised by the Advocate General that the Supreme Court vide prior decisions had allowed the use of green crackers. He also pointed out to the Court that the West Bengal Pollution Control Board on Wednesday had released a notification allowing the use of only 'green crackers' for a limited time of 2 hours during Diwali. This was done keeping in mind prior orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) dated November 9 and December 1, 2020, it was further submitted.  On the other hand, advocate Srijib Chakraborty appearing for an association of firecracker manufacturers argued before the Court that the Supreme Court in November 2020 had set aside an order of the Telangana High Court imposing a complete ban on sale and use of firecrackers and had further permitted the use of green crackers. He thus prayed before the Court to permit the use of only 'green crackers' as authorized by the certifying authority NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute).  To this, the Bench remarked,  "Is it possible to test firecrackers? Can you put a mechanism in place before 4th November? We can't kill people by following judgments blindly". The Bench further acknowledged that manufacturers of green crackers who have invested huge amount of resources would be left in the lurch at the eleventh hour. However, it recorded in its order that keeping in view the larger interest of the citizens of the State, the smaller interest of the firecracker manufacturers and all concerned with such business might be overlooked Taking note of the difficulties in ascertaining whether only "green crackers" as permitted by the Supreme Court are being used, the Court observed,  "Keeping in view the practical realities, we find nothing to establish that there is any mechanism in place at present to ascertain whether the crackers being sold or burst/lighted are only green crackers, complying with the norms as set in place by the relevant certifying Body." The Court also observed that it would be an impossible task by police and law enforcement bodies to inspect firecrackers and the classification under which they are sold. "It would be an impossible task for the police and/or law enforcement agencies to ascertain the veracity of the certificates of the crackers which are being used by the general public at the time of these festivals, irrespective of the classification under which they are sold. Leaving the window open for green crackers to be used, would positively entail abundant abuse of such window and there is no mechanism in place, as mentioned earlier, to screen such abuse at this juncture, when the festive season is on the anvil", the Court opined.  The Bench further observed that allowing the use of firecrackers even in places having a 'moderate' Air Quality Index (AQI) can cause severe difficulties for people suffering from respiratory problems.  "Keeping in mind the present pandemic situation, which is getting marginally worse by the day and in view of the fact that even moderate Air Quality Index (AQI) can cause severe difficulties for people suffering from respiratory problems and long exposure thereof may also affect otherwise healthy people, we are not convinced that firecrackers of any form, either green or of any other category, ought to be permitted to be used during the coming festive season", the order stated further.  The Court further clarified that the expression "firecrackers", shall cover all types of sparklers as well as other like material, whether or not the bursting/burning thereof involves any sound or light being generated. Accordingly, the Court disposed of the plea by directing the police authorities to take appropriate measures in this regard at the earliest.  Directions Issued  •	The police shall maintain a strict vigil to ensure that there is no further sale or purchase of firecrackers and/or any use of such firecrackers during the coming festive season •	The police shall further make efforts to confiscate all firecrackers of any kind or like which have the potential to pollute the air  •	Appropriate measures may be taken by the police authorities in such regard at the earliest. The petitioner has been represented by Advocates Rachit Lakhmani and Arindam Paul.  Case Title: Roshni Ali v. State of West Bengal     
Refusing to overturn a judgment of the trial court convicting an accused of raping and murdering a 9-year-old girl, the Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that child rape cases are the cases of the worst form of lust for sex, where children of tender age are not even spared in the pursuit of sexual pleasure. Stressing that there cannot be anything more obscene, diabolical, and barbaric than this, the Court further remarked thus: "It is a crime not only against society but against the entire humanity. Many such cases are not brought to light because of the fact that social stigma is attached thereto. According to some surveys, there has been a steep rise in child rape cases. The children need more care and protection not only by the parents and guardians but also by the Courts and society at large. In such cases, the responsibility is equally there on the shoulders of the Court so as to provide proper legal protection to these minor victims. Children are the natural resources of our country and are also the country's future. In our country, a girl child is in a very vulnerable position and one of the modes of her exploitation is rape besides other modes of sexual, emotional, and financial abuse." With this, the bench of Justice Sureshwar Thakur and Justice N. S. Shekhawat upheld the Judgment and order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Palwal holding the accused guilty of raping and murdering a 9-year-old girl and convicting him under Sections 363, 376(2)(f), 302, and 365 of the Indian Penal Code and awarding him a life sentence. "Having played with the life of a minor child aged about 9 years, which has been proved by the prosecution by leading unimpeachable and cogent evidence, we find no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Palwal and uphold and affirm the same," the Court remarked as it dismissed the plea of the accused challenging the judgment and order of his conviction. The case in brief The father of the 9-year-old victim lodged an FIR alleging that the appellant-convict, on April 30, 2009, came to his house and kidnapped his minor daughter 'A' (victim) and took her away on his bicycle, this fact was witnessed by his son Manish (PW-3/brother of the victim). Thereafter, the father and the brother of the victim made their endeavor to trace out the victim, but could not succeed and the next morning, they found the dead body of the victim in the fields in a nude condition. On the basis of the statement of the father, an FIR was registered under Sections 363, 376(2), and 302 of IPC against the present appellant, and the police machinery was set into motion. The appellant was apprehended by the police and he made his disclosure statement disclosing that he had kept concealed a bag in the corner of the fields of maize and parked his bicycle on the Railway Station, Palwal, which was used in the commission of offence. After due appreciation of the evidence, the trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant to life imprisonemnt. Challenging this order and judgment, the accused moved to the High Court. High Court's observations The High Court took into account the fact that the complainant/father of the victim was subjected to incisive cross-examination and he withstood the same and that he had no reason to depose falsely against the appellant or to falsely name him as a culprit in the instant case. The Court found his testimony to be truthful. Regarding the evidence of PW-3 Manish (11-year-old brother of the victim), the Court noted that had seen the appellant taking away his sister/ victim 'A' on his bicycle in the evening and that he knew the appellant because he had been coming to their home in connection with his work. The Court observed that the facts deposed by him were consistent and his sole testimony was sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellant.  In view of this, the Court discarded the arguments of the defence that since both PW-2 and PW-3 were interested witnesses, thus their testimony should be ignored. The Court observed thus as it noted that the trial court had rightly placed reliance on their testimonies:  "In fact, PW-3 Manish was the most natural witness and the appellant was known to him. Even he was the brother of the victim and his presence near the place of occurrence was natural. Still further, even he was subjected to cross-examination and his testimony was found worthy of placing reliance and was consistent. Still further, no reason for falsely implicating the appellant or any ill-will on the part of the said witnesses has been suggested to both the prosecution witnesses i.e. PW-2 Sunil and PW-3 Manish." Further, the Court also rejected the argument of the defense claiming alibi as the Court concluded that they had miserably failed in proving the plea of alibi and the testimonies of the two witnesses. Consequently, finding no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Palwal, the High Court uphold and affirm the same. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. Case title - Manoj Kumar v. State of Haryana [CRA-D-825-DB-2012 (O&M)]    
The Supreme Court has held that a consumer complaint is not maintainable against a power distributor for raising an additional bill on account of short-assessment.A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian agreed with the finding of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that the raising of additional bill did not amount to "deficiency in service" as defined... The Supreme Court has held that a consumer complaint is not maintainable against a power distributor for raising an additional bill on account of short-assessment. A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian agreed with the finding of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that the raising of additional bill did not amount to "deficiency in service" as defined under the Consumer Protection Act. Background facts The consumer had earlier approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission against the demand. The NCDRC however dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no 'deficiency of service' on the part of the power company and that the bill was for recovery of "escaped assessment". The consumer appealed to the Supreme Court against the NCDRC order. Raising additional demand not a "deficiency in service" A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian first considered the issue whether raising the additional demand will amount to "deficiency in service" within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act. The Court held that raising additional demand by itself will not amount to a "deficiency in service". "The raising of an additional demand in the form of "short assessment notice", on the ground that in the bills raised during a particular period of time, the multiply factor was wrongly mentioned, cannot tantamount to deficiency in service. If a licensee discovers in the course of audit or otherwise that a consumer has been short billed, the licensee is certainly entitled to raise a demand. So long as the consumer does not dispute the correctness of the claim made by the licensee that there was short assessment, it is not open to the consumer to claim that there was any deficiency. This is why, the National Commission, in the impugned order correctly points out that it is a case of "escaped assessment" and not "deficiency in service"". Observing as above, the bench held the dismissal of NCDRC as "perfectly in order". Also held in the judgment -  Electricity Act - Additional Bill Raised By Distributor After Detecting Mistake Not Hit By 2 Years Limitation Under Section 56(2) : Supreme Court  Case Title: M/S Prem Cottex v Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd & Ors| Civil Appeal Number 7235 of 2009   Coram: Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice V Ramasubramanian Appearances : Advocate KC Mittal for appellant; Additional Advocate General Of Haryana Govt Arun Bhardwaj for respondent     
The Supreme Court observed that an appeal against conviction cannot be treated as infructuous merely for the reason that the convicted appellant had served out the sentence awarded by the Trial Court.Merely for execution of the sentence, an appeal against conviction cannot be treated as infructuous, the bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath said.In this case, a... The Supreme Court observed that an appeal against conviction cannot be treated as infructuous merely for the reason that the convicted appellant had served out the sentence awarded by the Trial Court. Merely for execution of the sentence, an appeal against conviction cannot be treated as infructuous, the bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath said. In this case, a regular criminal appeal filed by the appellant-convict was dismissed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on the ground that no one appeared for the appellant. The Court had also accepted the submission of the State counsel that the appeal was rendered infructuous for the reason that the appellant had served out the sentence. [The accused- appellant was convicted under Section 18 of The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and the sentence awarded was only of five months' imprisonment with fine of Rs.3,000/-. ] Before the Apex Court, the appellant contended that even at the initial stage of appeal, it was specifically pointed out before the Court that the appellant had undergone the sentence of imprisonment and had deposited the fine imposed but, he was nevertheless seeking to assail his conviction. An appeal against conviction could not have been treated as infructuous merely for the reason that the convicted appellant had served out the sentence awarded by the Trial Court, it was contended. Agreeing with this contention, the bench observed: "Though learned counsel for the respondent has attempted to support the conviction and sentence of the appellant but could not dispute the position that merely for execution of the sentence, an appeal against conviction cannot be treated as infructuous."  The court further added that, since the matter before the High Court was an appeal against conviction, if nobody was present for the appellant for any reason, the High Court could have taken appropriate steps for representation on behalf of the appellant. In any case, the appeal could not have been dismissed as infructuous, the court said. Therefore, setting aside the High Court order, the bench restored the appeal filed by the appellant before the High Court for consideration on merits.  Case no. and Date: CrA 1385-1386 OF 2021 | 13 November 2021 Coram: Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath Counsel: AOR Yadav Narender Singh for appellant, Adv S.S. Boparai for respondent      
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Friday said that the disclosure of confidential and sensitive information in the grounds of detention of a person detained under Public Safety Act [PSA] can be counter-productive to the maintenance of normalcy in the Valley. The bench of Chief Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Moksha Kazmi Khajuria observed: "It may be worth noting that nothing more as revealed in the grounds of detention could have been spelt out as it would have been counter-productive to the maintenance of security of the State and normalcy in the valley. The situation in the valley does not permit disclosure of any further confidential or sensitive information which if goes in the hands of the separatist group would certainly be a great threat to the nation". Rejecting an argument regarding vagueness of grounds of detention in a PSA case, the bench further said: "The vagueness of the grounds of detention have to be considered in the fact of the situation prevailing in the area specially Kashmir which has been greatly affected by militancy in the past. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are of a firm opinion that the detention order cannot be said to be faulty on the ground of vagueness." The observations were made by the bench in its decision on a plea wherein the detenu had challenged the writ court verdict whereby his detention under PSA had been upheld. The petitioner, a 27-year-old, was detained under the orders issued by the District Magistrate Pulwama in October 30, 2021 in order to prevent him from any subversive activity prejudicial to the security of the State. Subsequently he challenged the order of detention before the Single Judge who after considering the matter dismissed his plea and upheld the order of detention vide judgment and order dated 12th May 2022. The single bench decision was challenged in appeal. While dealing with the primary contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the grounds of detention are vague which rendered it difficult for the petitioner-appellant to file an effective representation, the bench observed that a plain reading of the grounds of detention would establish that the allegations made against the petitioner-appellant are very specific and there is no vagueness. The court also said that the appellant never made any "slightest effort" to submit even a simple representation contending that he is submitting it "but with a caveat that it may not be effective as the grounds of detention were vague". Examining the grounds of detention, the bench observed that the grounds of detention in unequivocal terms state that the youth "is affiliated with The Resistance Front (TRF), an organization with the aim and object to secede the Union Territory of JK from the Union Territory of India so as to annex it with Pakistan". The court also noted that dossier specifically points that the he "in connivance with the terrorists is providing logistic support including transporting of arms for terrorists from one place to another through unconventional and safe passages". The bench further said that "he has been identified after hard coordinated efforts of the various agencies which revealed his linkage with terrorist outlets." However, the court accepted an argument that the detenu was not provided complete material, like the dossier relied upon by the District Magistrate in passing the impugned order, to enable him file an effective and purposeful representation. "It is an admitted position as is revealed from the plain reading of the detention order that the detaining authority has passed the same on the basis of the dossier supplied by the Senior Superintendent of Police. The copy of the said dossier was never supplied to the detenue-appellant", the bench noted. As the entire dossier which forms the basis of the detention order was not provided to him, the court said, "he was denied his Constitutional right to make a meaningful and a purposeful representation vitiating the order of detention." Accordingly, the bench allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and order of the writ court and the impugned order of detention. "The personal liberty of the petitioner-appellant is directed to be restored if not wanted in any other case," said the court Case Title : Murtaza Rashid Vs UT of J&K      
The Allahabad High Court has observed that the trial court has the power to allow the prosecution to produce the certificates under Section 65-B (4) of the Indian Evidence Act at a later point of time during the trial. The Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed thus as it upheld the order of the trial court allowing an application filed by the prosecution under section 311 CrPC to bring on record two certificates under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as they were not filed in property form during the filming of the charge sheet. It may be noted that Section 65B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act requires the production of a certificate for leading secondary evidence of an electronic record. This provision aims to sanctify secondary evidence in electronic form, generated by a computer. The case in brief One Shyam Sunder Prasad (Accused/Revisionist) was serving as the Branch Manager of Punjab National Bank. Allegedly, he demanded a bribe of Rs. 80,000/- from the complainant for defreezing the account. A complaint was made by the complainant in this regard. Now, during the verification of the complaint, on 25-04-2014, when the complainant met and requested the accused revisionist for reducing the bribe amount, he agreed to accept the bribe of Rs. 50,000/- by cheque. This conversation was recorded and transferred into a blank Compact Disc. A trap was laid and the accused revisionist was caught red-handed with a tainted bribe cheque. The conversation between the accused revisionist and the complainant was recorded during the transaction of the bribe cheque and the same was transferred into a blank Compact Disc.  The C.B.I. after investigation of the offence, filed a charge sheet for the offences punishable under sections 7 & 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against the accused revisionist in 2014. However, CBI did not file the certificate under section 65-B (4) in a proper format. Now, in 2021 an application under Section 311 CrPC was filed to bring on record two certificates (in connection with Compact Discs containing the conversation b/w the complainant and the accused) under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as well as to recall the witnesses to prove those certificates. The Court allowed the application, and therefore, aggrieved by the order, the accused/revisionist moved the HC with the instant revision plea challenging the order of the Special Judge, C.B.I. Court No. 6, Lucknow. It was the contention of the accused that no reason was given for filing certificates belatedly inasmuch as the charge sheet was filed in the year 2014 itself, but, the certificates are of the years 2021.  It was primarily argued that when the certificates are being issued by the C.B.I. Officers themselves, at this belated stage, accepting the certificates and allowing the application to recall the witnesses would be highly prejudicial to the trial of the accused. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court  relied upon the ruling of Arjun Pandit Rao Khotkar Vs. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal and others (2020) 7 SCC 1 , wherein it was held by the Apex Court that Section 65-B (4) of the Act does not  mention the stage of furnishing the certificate.In view of this, the High Court observed thus: "...for admissibility of an electronic record/document, section 65-B(4) is mandatory for recording it in evidence. When the electronic record is produced in evidence without proper certificate, trial court must summon the person/persons referred in Section 65-B (4) of the Indian Evidence Act, and require that such certificate be given by such person/persons...in appropriate cases, the trial court depending on the facts and circumstances of the case may exercise its discretion under section 91 or section 311 Cr.P.C. or Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act as the case may be and can allow the prosecution to produce the certificates under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act at later point of time and same would also be the case in respect of an accused who desires to produce the requisite certificates as part of his defence." Now, in view of the facts of the case, the Court observed that the two Compact Discs have already been supplied to the accused-revisionist and only certificates under section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act have been allowed to be produced to prove and by allowing the application under section 311 Cr.P.C.. The Court further added that by allowing the application, the accused-revisionist was not prejudiced in any manner by producing the certificates in respect of the electronic evidence and therefore, the Court dismissed the instant revision plea. Case title - Shyam Sunder Prasad v. Central Bureau Of Investigation Lucknow [CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 588 of 2022]   
"Every case has to be decided by the Courts strictly on merits and in accordance with law without being influenced by any kind of outside moral pressures."The Supreme Court on Monday acquitted the three people accused of committing murder and rape of a 19-year-old girl in the 2012 Chhawla Gang Rape Case. They were earlier convicted by the trial court and sentenced to death penalty which was ratified by the Delhi High Court on 26th August 2014. The bench of Chief Justice U. U. Lalit  and Justices S. Ravindra Bhat and Bela M. Trivedi  allowed the appeals filed by the three accused Rahul, Ravi and Vinod, assailing the judgments of the Delhi High Court. The bench set aside the orders of conviction passed by the trial court and the High Court stating that, "Every case has to be decided by the Courts strictly on merits and in accordance with law without being influenced by any kind of outside moral pressures." The Supreme Court in the judgment observed that, "As per the settled legal position, in order to sustain conviction, the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability, the crime was committed by the accused only and none else. The circumstantial evidence must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence." The Top Court stated that the prosecution was not able to prove the evidences with regard to the arrest of the accused, their identification, discoveries and recoveries of incriminating articles, medical and scientific evidence, the report of DNA profiling and evidences with regard to the CDRs. The Court also observed that there was no Test Identification Parade conducted during the course of investigation, nor were the accused identified by the witness during deposition. The bench further observed that the prosecution had also failed at pointing out the guilt of the Accused and due to the lack of clear and cogent evidences the conviction could not be sustained. "The prosecution has to bring home the charges levelled against them beyond reasonable doubt, which the prosecution has failed to do in the instant case, resultantly, the Court is left with no alternative but to acquit the accused, though involved in a very heinous crime. It may be true that if the accused involved in the heinous crime go unpunished or are acquitted, a kind of agony and frustration may be caused to the society in general and to the family of the victim in particular, however the law does not permit the Courts to punish the accused on the basis of moral conviction or on suspicion alone. No conviction should be based merely on the apprehension of indictment or condemnation over the decision rendered", the Court said in its judgment. The Top Court also stated in the judgment that, there were many glaring lapses during the trial of the matter. Out of the total 49 witnesses examined by the prosecution, 10 material witnesses were not cross-examined and many other important witnesses were not cross examined adequately by the defence counsel. The bench also observed that in various decisions the court had repeatedly observed that the judge is supposed to take active participation in the trial and question witnesses, but in the present case the judge played a role of a passive umpire. The Court thus, observed that the lack of cross-examination of the key witnesses and the judge playing the role of passive umpires, the accused were deprived of the rights to have a fair trial.Senior Advocate Sonia Mathur appeared for one of the accused as an amicus curiae. Senior Advocate A Sirajudeen appeared for another accused. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati appeared for the State.FACTS OF THE CASE The victim, a 19-year-old girl was abducted near Hanuman Chowk, Qutub Vihar, Chhawla on 9th February at about 9 o' clock at the night while she was returning from her work at DLF Gurgaon along with her friends. On the basis of the statements of her friends who were along with her, an FIR was registered under section 363 of the IPC and investigation commenced. According to the police, the accused Rahul was arrested first and on his confession, his brother Ravi and one Vinod was also arrested. The police claimed that the accused confessed of committing rape, killing the girl and throwing the body in fields ahead of Jhajjar. The body of the victim was recovered from Mustard fields near Karawara Morel.Upon completion of the investigation a chargesheet was filed and upon committal of the case to the court of sessions charges under sections 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 367 (Kidnapping or abducting in order to subject person to grievous hurt, slavery, etc), 376(2)(g) (Gang Rape), 377 (Unnatural Offences), 302 (Punishment for murder) and 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) read along with Section 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). The trial court convicted the accused and gave them death penalty which was ratified by the High Court.Case Title: Rahul vs State of Delhi Ministry of Home Affairs and Anr – Crl. A. No. 611/2022 Death Penalty - Supreme Court acquits three persons who were sentenced to death by the trial court and the High Court for rape and murder of a 19-year old girl- Supreme Court notes lapses in investigation and trial - No Test Identification of accused done- Accused no identified during trial by witnesses- many witnesses no cross-examined- recoveries not proved [Paras 32-34] Death Penalty -It may be true that if the accused involved in the heinous crime go unpunished or are acquitted, a kind of agony and frustration may be caused to the society in general and to the family of the victim in particular, however the law does not permit the Courts to punish the accused on the basis of moral conviction or on suspicion alone. No conviction should be based merely on the apprehension of indictment or condemnation over the decision rendered.Every case has to be decided by the Courts strictly on merits and in accordance with law without being influenced by any kind of outside moral pressures. Circumstantial Evidence -I n order to sustain conviction, the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability, the crime was committed by the accused only and none else. The circumstantial evidence must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence [Para 33] Indian Evidence Act - Section 165- Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act confers unbridled powers upon the trial courts to put any question at any stage to the witnesses to elicit the truth.

The Rajasthan High Court on Friday denied bail to two accused, including the girl's brother, in a case 'having a strong trait of honour killing'. Essentially, the deceased-Azad and the accused petitioner-Bhim Saini's sister were in a relationship. As the girl's family was not pleased with the same, therefore, the couple eloped. They were later apprehended by the police and the girl was made to accompany the petitioner-side. The deceased filed a habeas corpus petition following which, the parties attempted to settle the matter through compromise and accordingly, the deceased withdrew the petition. In a close proximity of time, the boy went missing and after four days his dead body was found lying in a pond tied with the heavy iron material.  On investigation, it was found that the cause of death was due to suffocation from strangulation and not due to drowning. Moreover, the deceased had also uploaded the chat on his Instagram specifically stating that "bhai mujhe jaan se maarna chahta hai bhim saini. Shaadi karli hai uski ladki se." (I have married the girl. His brother Bhim Saini wants to kill me) He also chatted with one Dinesh Kumawat regarding death threats. The court remarked that the instant case has its own peculiar facts which have a circumstantially diffusing smell of intent-full homicidal death on account of Honour and prestige i.e. having a strong trait of honour killing. Justice Farjand Ali, while dismissing the bail application of the two accused, observed, "Needless, to observe that every citizen of this country is abided and governed by rule of Law and one has to follow it as no one is above the Law, as in fact no one can. Every citizen is principally embodied to access their fundamental right and legal right peacefully and if it is being hindered by any one, the rule of law and the procedure established by law is there for its recourse, but no citizen is allowed to take the course of law in its own hands, strictly not." The court noted that the chain of events tentatively showing a well designed conspiracy and the complicity of every accused person is very much available on record. The court assumed from the circumstances that the petitioners are mighty and influential persons. The court opined that the circumstance of non recording of statements of girl Jiya, Dinesh, and the lawyer before whom the compromise talks were made; raises serious doubts and concerns. The possibility of winning over the witness at this stage as well as hampering the same could not be ruled out, added the court. While invoking and exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction, the court directed the Superintendent of Police, Bundi to appoint a competent officer not below the rank of Add. SP to conduct further investigation in the matter under section 173(8) CrPC and to file a supplementary chargesheet before the trial court taking all the other left out relevant evidence in the matter within 60 days from the date of receipt of this order. It was added that the relevant witnesses or documents which the trial court feels just and appropriate; be taken on record and shall proceed in accordance with law. The court also remarked,  "The thrust for the justice should not be defeated merely on technical points rather it shall be ensured that the justice should be done above the technical barriers as the procedure is the handmade of justice." Moreover, it was opined by the court that the fact of the present case is actively pregnant with motive. As on the pitch of relevancy; motive remains a determining factor for washing away clouds over certain facts and pushes blurred discoloured events towards clarity by establishing a logical link/relation between certain acts so committed in the thrust of a desired result, added the court. After perusal of Section 8 of the Indian Evidence Act, the court observed that motive is a relevant fact in itself, in other words, it can be said that it is like a gravitational force which pulls a person's consciousness rather drives him towards to do or omit to do a particular act for the desired result. The court opined that in the present matter, the accused petitioner could not seem to have digested the fact of the relationship of his sister Jiya with the deceased. Certain events thereafter appears to have added fuel in the fire which had germinated the fact in issue i.e the murder of Azad, added the court. Mr. A.K. Gupta, Sr. Counsel with Mr. Aniket Sharma and Mr. Anil Upman appeared on behalf of the petitioners. Mr. Ghanshyam Singh, GA/AAG, Mr. Mangal Singh Saini, PP and Mr. R.P. Vijay appeared on behalf of the respondent. Case Title: Bhim Saini @ Bhimraj Saini v. State of Rajasthan with other connected matter  (Raj) 184   
The Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to not take any coercive measures against Trinamool Congress Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondal without the leave of the Court.

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to not take any coercive measures against Trinamool Congress Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondal without the leave of the Court.  Mondal had moved the High Court seeking protection from arrest pursuant to the issuance of a CBI notice directing him to appear before its investigating team for the ongoing probe into the West Bengal post poll violence cases. He had been summoned by the CBI as a witness at the NIT camp office in Durgapur in neighbouring Paschim Bardhaman district at 11am on Thursday in connection with a murder case at Alambazar in Birbhum which is alleged to have a connection with the post-poll violence in West Bengal. It may be noted that a 5 judge Bench of the High Court vide order dated August 19, 2021 had handed over to the CBI the investigation of the cases related to murder, rape and crime against women in connection with the violence in the State of West Bengal that had allegedly taken place in May 2021 soon after the declaration of the assembly election results.  Justice Rajasekhar Mantha directed the petitioner to appear before the CBI at its Durgapur office and corporate with the ongoing investigation and further observed,  In the event of any such fresh notice, the petitioner shall appear and cooperate in such investigation. However, no coercive measures shall be taken by the CBI against the petitioner without the leave of this Court. While dictating the order, the Court further noted that the instant petition had become infructuous since the impugned notice issued by the CBI had directed the petitioner to appear on Thursday at 11am. However, it was observed that the notice issued under Section 160 CrPC by the CBI is still at large as such a notice has not been withdrawn by the CBI.  Accordingly, Justice Mantha observed that the CBI is entitled to fix any other time for investigation and accordingly directed the CBI to issue notice afresh if necessary and call upon the petitioner for questioning at its Durgapur office.  The Court rejected the contention of the CBI that the petitioner should have preferred an anticipatory bail application owing to the availability of alternative remedies. The Court underscored that jurisdiction of a writ Court under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be ousted in so far as rights under Article 21 of the Constitution are involved and a prayer has been made of invasion of such rights. Reliance was placed on the Calcutta High Court judgment in Shyamali Adhikari v. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation in this regard. It was further held that it is a well settled law that each case must be looked at on its own facts and that ratio cannot be made de hors the facts.  "The facts and circumstances of the instant case indicate that the petitioner apprehends infringement of rights under Article 21 of the Constitution", the Court noted further. The Court proceeded to further observe that protection under Article 226 of the Constitution is granted to even the worst offenders. Justice Mantha also took into consideration that the petitioner is not the principal accused in the FIR registered but is merely a witness.   Furthermore, the Court also dismissed the contention of the CBI that the territorial limitations as envisaged under Section 160 CrPC does not apply to a CBI investigation.  "This Court is of the view that given the object and purpose of the Section 160 of the Cr.P.C. it must apply even to the investigations of the CBI. The fact that the CBI acts under its own manual and under the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act 1946 will not deprive a citizen of this Country, much less a person who not even the principal accused of the fairness and due process of law, which have been mandated and engraved into Section 160 of the CrPC", the Court underscored further.  Submissions on behalf of the petitioner  Advocate Sandipan Ganguly appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner had been summoned to appear as a witness in a case registered by the CBI pertaining to the West Bengal post poll violence. The Court was apprised that the highest charge in the concerned case is that of murder under Section 302 of the IPC. The Court was also informed that notices had been issued to the petitioner by the CBI under Section 160 of the CrPC. The first such notice had been issued on January 27, 2022 and thereafter, the petitioner had responded on January 28, 2022 stating that due to his various ailments, he will only be able to appear before the CBI after 8 weeks. Subsequently, without addressing the averments made by the petitioner in his reply, the CBI issued another notice seeking appearance on January 28, 2022 itself.  The counsel argued that under Section 160 CrPC, the police officer issuing notice thereunder must be the person within whose territorial limits the noticee must reside. He argued that in the instant case, the petitioner is a resident of Bolpur which does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Durgapur Police Station or any other adjoining police station. Accordingly, the counsel submitted that the CBI should have directed the petitioner to appear at any office in Bolpur instead of in Durgapur.  Arguing further, the counsel remarked, "Under the guise of calling me as a witness, I may be apprehended..it is a practice adopted by police authorities". He further submitted that the petitioner is willing to appear before the Durgapur in the event that the Court protects him from the apprehended arrest.  Opposing the argument of the CBI that no reasonable case of apprehension of arrest has been made out, the counsel submitted that the conduct of the CBI to not even address the reply of the petitioner dated January 28, 2022 and instead issue another notice reflects such an apprehension.  The Court was also apprised that the CBI had issued notices from an address in Lucknow and thus he remarked further in this regard, "They are coming to Durgapur from Lucknow, what prevents them from coming to Bolpur?" Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgment in Vinod Dua v. Union of India and it was pointed out that the Supreme Court had granted protection from arrest against an issuance of notice under Section 160 CrPC by the CBI.  Submissions on behalf of the CBI  Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju appearing for the CBI argued that if the petitioner apprehends arrest, then he should be filing an anticipatory bail application. He emphasised that a writ petition cannot be a substitute for an anticipatory bail application. Thus, it was contended that the writ petition is hit by the principal of alternative remedy and thus should not be entertained. Reliance was placed on the Calcutta High Court judgement in Rakesh Singh v. State of West Bengal in this regard.  He further submitted that since the counsel for the petitioner has already averred that the petitioner would be willingly to go to the concerned office in Durgapur if protection is given to him against any coercive action, thus he argued that the health grounds relied upon by the petitioner are a sham. It was also submitted that any apprehension of arrest has not been made out by the petitioner vide the averments made in the writ petition.  "He has been issued notice under Section 160 CrPC, where is the apprehension of arrest?", ASG Raju further remarked.  Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court judgments in Sushila Aggarwal v. State (Nct Of Delhi) and Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra and accordingly contended that an order granting protection against arrest cannot be issued if a reasonable case of arrest is not made out.  Furthermore, the ASG argued that the petitioner does not come with clean hands before the Court. He submitted that the Court while passing orders under Section 482 CrPC or Article 226 of the Constitution, acts as a Court of Equity. He further referred to the reply filed by the petitioner to the notice issued by the CBI and accordingly argued that the response was a sham on the face of it.  Referring to the contention of the petitioner that he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the ASG further submitted that it is a chronic disease and not an acute disease. He argued that one can carry out regular activities with a chronic disease which is in other words a disease that one possesses for a lifetime.  It was thus reiterated that the health grounds relied upon by the petitioner to not appear before the CBI is thus a sham and is bogus in nature.  The ASG also fervently argued that there is a difference between an investigation being conducted by the local police authorities and the CBI and thus submitted that territorial limitations as envisaged under Section 160 CrPC does not apply to a CBI investigation.  Case Title: Anubrata Mondal v. Union of India     
"Pertinently, the 1961 Act does not tie in the grant of maternity benefit to the tenure of the woman employee",In a significant judgment that can come to the aid of women who are employed on contractual basis, the Delhi High Court has held that an ad-hoc employee will be entitled to maternity benefits under the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961, beyond the period of the contract, for a pregnancy occurring during the tenure of the employment.Since the object of the Maternity Benefits Act is to grant benefits... In a significant judgment that can come to the aid of women who are employed on contractual basis, the Delhi High Court has held that an ad-hoc employee will be entitled to maternity benefits under the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961, beyond the period of the contract, for a pregnancy occurring during the tenure of the employment. Since the object of the Maternity Benefits Act is to grant benefits to the woman both during pregnancy and after child-birth, the High Court said that the benefits cannot be tied up to the tenure of the contract. As long as pregnancy occurs during the tenure of the contract, she should be entitled to maternity benefits, the Court held. A bench comprising Justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh observed : "The object and purpose of the 1961 Act being, to not only regulate employment but also maternity benefits which precede and follow childbirth, point in the direction that tying up the tenure of the contract with the period for which a woman employee can avail of maternity benefit is contrary to the mandate of the legislation i.e., the 1961 Act. Thus, as long as conception occurs before the tenure of the contract executed between a woman-employee and her employer expires, she should be entitled to, in our opinion, maternity benefits as provided under the 1961 Act". Whether contractual employee is entitled to maternity benefits beyond the contractual period? The question which arose in the petition was whether an ad hoc employee is entitled to maternity benefit for a period that spills beyond the tenure of the contract? Brief factual background In this case, the employee was working on contractual basis at Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial Hospital under the Delhi Government. The offer made to the employee provided that the appointment would be for a period of 45 / 89 days or till a regular incumbent joins the post, whichever is earlier. Her tenure was extended four times. Notably, each time the respondent's tenure lasted 89 days, and after a short break of one day, the contract was renewed for another 89 days. Her last tenure was till 27.06.2017. Two months before the expiry of the term, on 17.04.2017, she applied for emergency maternity leave as due to complicated pregnancy, she was advised to undergo an emergent caesarean section procedure. However, the hospital, instead of granting her maternity leave, terminated her services by an office order dated 23.05.2017, with effect from 24.04.2017. Aggrieved with this, she approached the Central Administrative Tribunal and also the National Commission for Women. Following that, the hospital agreed to give her maternity benefits, but only till 27.06.2017 (the date of tenure end). The employee then approached the Tribunal again seeking maternity benefits for 26 weeks with effect from 17.04.2017. The Tribunal directed the hospital to grant her maternity benefits in terms of Section 5(2) of the Act.  Challenging the Tribunal direction, the hospital approached the High Court. The hospital's primary argument was that Tribunal had erred in directing to grant maternity leave to the respondent for the entire 26 weeks, without having regard to the fact that her tenure had culminated on 27.06.2017. High Court's analysis The Bench observed that the Act seeks to regulate the employment of women in certain establishments for given periods before and after child-birth, and, in particular, endeavours to provide for maternity benefit. "Clearly, the provisions of the 1961 Act seek to invest a woman with a statutory right to take maternity leave and seek payment for the period that she is absent from duty on account of her pregnancy, albeit in accordance with the provisions of the 1961 Act," the Bench said.  The Court was also of the view that the provisions of the Act do not differentiate between a permanent employee and a contractual employee, or even a daily wage (muster roll) worker.  "The provisions of the 1961 Act do not differentiate between a permanent employee and a contractual employee, or even a daily wage (muster roll) worker. This position stands unambiguously articulated in the judgement of the Supreme Court rendered in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) v. Female Workers (Muster Roll) & Anr. (2000) 3 SCC 224", the Court noted. Maternity Benefits not tied to the employee's tenure "Pertinently, the 1961 Act does not tie in the grant of maternity benefit to the tenure of the woman employee", the Court observed. The Court noted that the two limiting factors for the grant of maternity benefits are: - First, the woman-employee should have worked in an establishment of her employer for a minimum period of 80 days in 12 months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery. - Second, the maximum period for which she can avail maternity leave benefit cannot exceed 26 weeks, of which, not more than 8 weeks shall precede the date of her expected delivery.  In this backdrop, the Court noted : "Therefore, linking the tenure of employment, in this case, a contractual employee, with the period for which maternity benefits can be availed by a woman employee, is not an aspect that emerges on a plain reading of the provisions of the 1961 Act". It added : "The object and purpose of the 1961 Act being, to not only regulate employment but also maternity benefits which precede and follow childbirth, point in the direction that tying up the tenure of the contract with the period for which a woman employee can avail of maternity benefit is contrary to the mandate of the legislation i.e., the 1961 Act. Thus, as long as conception occurs before the tenure of the contract executed between a woman-employee and her employer expires, she should be entitled to, in our opinion, maternity benefits as provided under the 1961 Act." "As adverted to hereinabove, there is nothing stated in sub-section (2) of section 5 of the 1961 Act which links the grant of maternity to the tenure of the contract" Benefits of Act must be given once the conditions are fulfilled The Court further held : "The benefit granted to the respondent under Section 5 of the 1961 Act should have a full play, in our view, once the prerequisites contained therein are fulfilled by the claimant i.e., the woman-employee". "The 1961Act is a social legislation that should be worked in a manner that progresses not only the best interest of the women-employee but also of the child, both at the pre-natal and post-natal stage. Without financial wherewithal, the interest of women-employee and her child is likely to be severely impacted," the Court said.  Not interfering with the order passed by the Tribunal, the Court dismissed the petition.  Title: DR. BABA SAHEB AMBEDKAR HOSPITAL GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI & ANR. v. DR. KRATI MEHROTRA     
The Calcutta High Court on Monday held that once a regular case of "scheduled offence" is quashed, any subsequent case registered under Prevention of Money Laundering Act will also automatically stand quashed. The observation was made while hearing a criminal revision application against PMLA proceedings. A criminal complaint was registered against the instant applicants under Sections 120B/420/409 IPC read with Section 13 of PMLA on the basis whereof the Enforcement Director, the respondent no. 1 herein, initiated investigation under provisions of PMLA. The said investigation eventually culminated into proceedings before the PMLA Appellate Tribunal whereby the Appellate Tribunal set aside an earlier order of attachment of property on the basis of its finding that the properties sought to be attached were not purchased from alleged "proceeds of crime" and that the allegation of money laundering against the instant applicants were unsustainable for the purpose of attachment under PMLA.  As regards the parallel criminal proceeding arising out of an FIR instituted under Sections 420/120B IPC read with S. 13 of PMLA, being a "scheduled offence" within the meaning of PMLA which were pending before the Metropolitan Magistrate CBI Court at Calcutta, the said proceeding was quashed by the Court vide a judgment and order of August 2, 2018. Petitioners accordingly contended that the subsequent proceedings instituted under PMLA and pending before the City Sessions Court could not survive independently on account of the negation of the scheduled offence.  The Single Judge Bench of Justice Subhendu Samanta, in deciding the question of whether any subsequently registered PMLA case can survive independently consequent to the quashment of a prior regular case involving a "scheduled offence", held:  "This court is a view that the pendency of PMLA case cannot be sustained at this juncture. Moreover, Hon'ble Appellate Tribunal PMLA is of specific finding that no proceeds of crime of the PMLA case has arisen from the regular case No. RCBSK2009E0008. The said regular case has already been quashed by this court. Thus, at the situation there is no proceeds of crime by virtue of order of quashing of the regular case.  The quashing of FIR of regular case automatically created a situation that the offences, stated and alleged in the FIR has no existence; thus the "Scheduled Offence" has also no existence after quashing of the FIR. When there is no "Scheduled Offence", the proceeding initiated under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 cannot stand alone.  Thus, the question answered in affirmative."  The Court, in arriving at its decision, extensively relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Vijay Mandalay Chowdhury & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., as cited by the counsels for the petitioners, on the position of law that an offence of money laundering under Section 3 of PMLA is "dependent on illegal gain of property as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence". Therefore, it was held that if a person was discharged/acquitted of the scheduled offence or the criminal case against him was quashed by the Court of competent jurisdiction, there could not be an offence of money laundering against him or any one claiming such property being the property linked to stated scheduled offence through him.  Accordingly, the Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC, quashed the PMLA case pending before the City Sessions Court and the FIR instituted in connection therewith.  Case: M/s Nik Nish Retail Ltd. & Anr. v. Assistant Director, Enforcement Directorate, Govt. of India & Ors., CRR No. 2752 of 2018  Date: 28.11.2022     
The Orissa High Court has held that mere pendency of criminal cases cannot be the sole ground to deny renewal of passport of a person. A Single Judge Bench of Justice Biswanath Rath observed, "…in the opinion of this Court there is in fact no restriction in the renewal of the passport or even grant of passport in the pendency of the criminal proceeding involving the party... The Orissa High Court has held that mere pendency of criminal cases cannot be the sole ground to deny renewal of passport of a person. A Single Judge Bench of Justice Biswanath Rath observed,  "…in the opinion of this Court there is in fact no restriction in the renewal of the passport or even grant of passport in the pendency of the criminal proceeding involving the party concerned which may be a time based renewal or grant." Brief Facts:  The petitioner herein worked in oilfields of the UAE. He had a contractual service in a firm on a 30 days renewal basis. He was also granted visa by the competent authority. However, his passport was going to expire on 17.05.2022. Finding that the passport was going to expire, as a consequence rendering visa infructuous, he made an application for renewal of the passport to get visa continuity in order to continue his service in the overseas oilfields.   On making the application, the petitioner was served with a communication by the opposite party no. 2, i.e. Regional Passport Officer, Bhubaneswar, thereby declined to entertain request of the petitioner to renew the passport on the ground that there were at least two criminal cases pending against him. Therefore, this writ petition was filed by the petitioner impugning such communication.  Contentions of the Petitioner:  Mr. D.P. Dhal, Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that mere pendency of criminal proceedings and especially when such proceedings were initiated at the instance of the wife, because of some marital differences between the husband and wife, should not have been a ground declining to entertain the renewal application.   He also argued that in the event there is refusal of renewal of the passport, it will render the petitioner jobless and such action may also create a stigma in getting further employment. He took the Court to the provision laid down under Section 6(2)(f) of the Passports Act, 1967 ('the Act') and the notification No. GSR 570(E) dated 15.8.1993 ('the notification') issued by the competent authority and also relied on multiple cases to substantiate his arguments.  Contentions of the Respondents:  Mr. P.K. Parhi, the Assistant Solicitor General of India appearing for the Passport Authority, contended that since the petitioner's attempt was to leave the country during the pendency of the criminal cases, there was difficulty in granting the renewal of passport as the petitioner may not be available with the competent authority in the event the said criminal proceedings culminate in conviction.   Court's Observation:  The Court perused the notification and observed that it clearly provides opportunity for grant of renewal of passport subject to several rider but, however, the citizen so applying shall have to give an undertaking in writing to the passport authority that he shall, if required by the court concerned, appear before it at any time during the continuance of the passport so issued.   The Court held that there is no restriction in the renewal of the passport or even grant of passport in the pendency of the criminal proceeding involving the party concerned which may be a time-based renewal or grant. The Court relied upon multiple cases to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion, including the judgment of the Supreme Court in Vangala Kasturi Rangacharyulu v. Central Bureau of Investigation.  It also took note of the reason of rejection of renewal provided in the Annexure-2, where it was clearly mentioned that in the circumstance stated therein, petitioner's application could not be considered under Tatkal category and at the same time he was asked to apply under the normal category.   Consequently, the Court permitted the petitioner to submit the required affidavit/undertaking to the concerned Passport Authority at Bhubaneswar, furnishing his position in both the criminal cases and supporting documents establishing that he is on bail. In the event of receipt of such affidavit, the Passport Authority at Bhubaneswar was directed to renew the passport.  Case Title: Asutosh Amrit Patnaik v. State of Orissa & Ors.

The Rajasthan High Court, bench at Jaipur has held that the anticipatory bail application of a person, already in custody in connection to a criminal case, will not be maintainable with respect to another criminal case registered for commission of similar or different offences.

The Rajasthan High Court, bench at Jaipur has held that the anticipatory bail application of a person, already in custody in connection to a criminal case, will not be maintainable with respect to another criminal case registered for commission of similar or different offences.  Justice Sanjeev Prakash Sharma was of the view that it would be appropriate that a footnote is added in all bail applications moved under Section 438 Cr.P.C. mentioning that the accused has not been arrested and is not in custody in any other case.  "Once the FIR has been registered in relation to an offence committed against any person by an accused, he cannot claim to be protected from offences which he may have committed with other persons who have their individual right of registering an FIR against such an accused. The accused will have to face investigation and subsequent trial in relation to each and every case individually," the Court observed.  The Court also added that it would be nothing but a travesty of justice in allowing anticipatory bail to such an accused who is already in custody. The development came while the Court was dealing with an anticipatory bail plea which rose the question "whether an anticipatory bail application would be maintainable by an accused who is already arrested and is in judicial custody in relation to another FIR registered against him for the offences mentioned therein." Analysing Section 46 read with Section 438 of CrPC, the Court observed, "the essential part of arrest is placing the corpus, body of the person in custody of the police authorities whether of a police station or before him or in a concerned jail. The natural corollary is therefore that a person who is already in custody cannot have reasons to believe that he shall be arrested as he stands already arrested. In view thereof, the precondition of bail application to be moved under Section 438 Cr.P.C. i.e. "reasons to believe that he may be arrested" do not survive since a person is already arrested in another case and is in custody whether before the police or in jail." Reliance was placed on Narinderjit Singh Sahni & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors., (2002) 2 SCC 210, where the Top Court had observed that "it is trite knowledge that Section 438 CrPC is made applicable only in the event of there being an apprehension of arrest. The petitioners in the writ petitions herein are all inside the prison bars upon arrest against all cognizable offences, and in the wake of the aforesaid question relieving the petitioners from unnecessary disgrace and harassment would not arise." The counsel appearing for the petitioner argued that there may be cases where a person who has already been arrested in a particular case may be faced with registering of several FIRs by the persons who do not want him to be released from jail and in the said circumstances, only option available to him is to take anticipatory bail in other FIRs as the police would seek his arrest in all the cases. Rejecting this argument, the Court said that the question as to whether such a person may be punished separately or jointly for other cases need not be gone into the matter.  "...if such an application is held to be maintainable, the result would be that if an accused is arrested say for an offence committed of abduction and another case is registered against him for having committed murder and third case is registered against him for having stolen the car which was used for abduction in a different police station and the said accused is granted anticipatory bail in respect to the offence of stealing of the car or in respect to the offence of having committed murder, the concerned Police Investigating Agency where FIRs have been registered, would be prevented from conducting individual investigation and making recoveries as anticipatory bail once granted would continue to operate without limitation as laid down by the Apex Court in Sushila Aggarwal. The concept of anticipatory bail as envisaged under Section 438 Cr.P.C. would stand frustrated," the Court added.  Further observing that the petitioner was already arrested in some other case, the anticipatory bail plea was dismissed.  Case Title: Sunil Kallani v. State of Rajasthan Through Public Prosecutor   
The Jharkhand High Court has ruled that if the application for appointment of Arbitrator under Section 11(6)(c) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) is itself not maintainable on the ground of inordinate delay in filing it, the issue of limitation cannot be referred to the Arbitrator for adjudication.  The Single Bench of Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad held that, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another versus Nortel Networks India Private Limited (2021), the issue of limitation is required to be answered at the threshold itself, i.e., at the stage where the application filed under Section 11(6)(c) of the A&C Act is considered by the Court.  The petitioner/applicant Jharia Petrol Supply entered into a dealership agreement with the respondent Indian Oil Corporation Limited for sale of petroleum products. After the said agreement was terminated by the respondent, the petitioner filed a writ petition before the Jharkhand High Court challenging the termination of the agreement. The writ petition was dismissed by the High Court on the ground that the alternative remedy of an arbitration clause in the said agreement was available to petitioner. Against this, the petitioner filed an intra court appeal before the Division Bench of the Jharkhand High, which was also dismissed on the ground of availability of the alternative remedy of arbitration. The Division Bench, while dismissing the appeal, granted liberty to the petitioner to approach the respondent for appointment of Arbitrator. After the respondent failed to respond to the request for appointment of Arbitrator, the petitioner filed an application under Section 11(6)(c) of the A&C Act for appointment of Arbitrator before the Jharkhand High Court.  The respondent Indian Oil Corporation submitted before the High Court that the application filed by the petitioner was not maintainable since it was filed after an inordinate delay of 20 years from the date of passing of the order by the Division Bench, wherein liberty was granted to the petitioner to approach the respondent for appointment of Arbitrator. The respondent added that the request for appointment of Arbitrator was also made by the petitioner to the respondent after a lapse of 16 years from the date of the said order.  The respondent contended that in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another versus Nortel Networks India Private Limited (2021), the provisions of Article 137 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be applicable to the application filed for appointment of the Arbitrator under Section 11 (6) of the A&C Act. Hence, the respondent averred that the application for appointment of Arbitrator filed by the petitioner was barred by limitation since it was filed beyond the period of three years, as provided under Article 137 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act.  The Court observed that the petitioner had not acted immediately after the passing of the order by the Division Bench of the High Court, and that the petitioner made a request to the respondent for appointment of Arbitrator after a lapse of 16 years from the passing of the said order.  The Court noted that the Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another versus Nortel Networks India Private Limited (2021) had held that the provisions of Article 137 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1963 are applicable to the proceedings where an application filed under Section 11(6)(c) of the A&C Act is under consideration of the Court.  The Court ruled that since the order passed by the Division Bench was not challenged by the petitioner, hence, it remained conclusive. Therefore, the Court held that the limitation period of three years was required to be counted from the date of the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court.  The Court held that though the limitation can be condoned if the party shows a sufficient cause for its condonation, however, the petitioner had failed to give any such reason.  The Court observed that the petitioner had relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Limited versus Northern Coal Field Limited (2019), in support of its contention that the issue of limitation should not be considered by the Court at the stage of deciding an application for appointment of an Arbitrator, and that the issue of limitation should be adjudicated upon by the Arbitrator.  The Court noted that the Supreme Court in the case of Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam (2019) had held that the issue of limitation is a mixed question of fact and law, and that a finding on the issue of limitation would be a jurisdictional issue. Hence, the Court observed that the Supreme Court had ruled that the issue of limitation being a jurisdictional issue would have to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.  The Court observed that the decision in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another (2021) was rendered after the decision in Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Limited (2019). The Court held that it is a settled law that the recent decision of the Supreme Court will have binding precedence over its former judgments that deal with the same issue.  The Court added that the Supreme Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another (2021) had taken into consideration the ratio laid down in Uttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Limited (2019), before passing its judgment.  Thus, the Court held that in view of the law laid down in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Another (2021), if the application for appointment of Arbitrator under Section 11(6)(c) of the A&C Act is itself not maintainable on the ground of inordinate delay in filing it, the issue of limitation cannot be referred to the Arbitrator for adjudication. The Court added that the issue of limitation would be required to be answered at the threshold, i.e., at the stage where the application filed under Section 11(6)(c) of the A&C Act is considered by the Court.  Therefore, the Court ruled that the application filed by the petitioner under Section 11(6)(c) of the A&C Act after a lapse of more than 16 years from the date of the order passed by the Division Bench, was barred by limitation since it was filed after a delay of more than three years, as provided under Article 137 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1963.  The Court thus dismissed the application.

The Supreme Court, on Thursday, held that it is not open for High Courts to implead third parties in exercise of powers under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the provision that deals with anticipatory bail.

The Supreme Court, on Thursday, held that it is not open for High Courts to implead third parties in exercise of powers under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the provision that deals with anticipatory bail.  In a plea assailing interim orders of the Patna High Court which had issued notice seeking appearance of Sahara Chief Subrata Roy in anticipatory bail proceedings of one Promod Kumar Saini and co-accused, a Bench comprising Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and J.B. Pardiwala observed -  "We hold that it is not open to the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 438 Cr.P.C. to add third parties to the proceedings, as if it is invoking powers under Order 1 Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure much less those parties who are neither necessary nor proper parties to the application under consideration."  The Bench clarified that the scope of inquiry of the High Court is quite narrow in an anticipatory bail application under Section 438 Cr.P.C. The application being limited to the concerned applicant and the offence registered against them, the Court's inquiry ought to be restricted to the facts relevant to the applicant before the Court. Any inquiry into matters pertaining to third parties, especially when it is beyond the scope of the complaint, is impermissible.  It further observed -  "Even if the application is entertained by the High Court, the High Court should exercise circumspection in dealing with the application only in respect of matters which are relevant to decide the application and not to over-state facts or other matters unrelated to the applicant before the Court.  The Counsel appearing for the State had vehemently defended the orders of the High Court arguing that it had taken a broader view of the matter and therefore, it was open to the High Court to inquire into certain aspects. The Bench was quick to dismiss his submission in the following terms -   "Such a plea, if accepted, is fraught with the danger of allowing Sessions Court/High Court to transcend beyond the scope of application under Section 438 Cr.P.C. and the matters relevant to be decided by the Court." The Supreme Court found fault with the High Court for summoning Subrata Roy and directing him to return the investments, while considering the bail application of another accused.  Case Name: Subrata Roy Sahara v. Pramod Kumar Saini And Ors.   Case No. and Date: SLP (Crl) No. 4877-4878 of 2022 | 14 July 2022  Corum: Justices AM Khanwilkar and JB Pardiwala     Headnotes   Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 - Section 438 - anticipatory bail jurisdiction - cannot implead third party to proceedings - especially those parties who are neither necessary nor proper parties to the application under consideration - application under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is limited to the cause of the concerned applicant, applying for grant of anticipatory bail in connection with offence already registered against him and apprehending his arrest in connection with such a case for extraneous reasons or otherwise - in such proceedings, the inquiry must be limited to the facts relevant and applicable to the concerned applicant who has come before the Court - no attempt should be made to inquire into matters pertaining to some third party much less beyond the scope of the complaint/FIR in question - even if the application is entertained by the High Court, the High Court should exercise circumspection in dealing with the application only in respect of matters which are relevant to decide the application and not to over-state facts or other matters unrelated to the applicant before the Court.                
The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently upheld its decision of not interfering with the order passed by the Disciplinary Authority, directing compulsory retirement of a court reader as punishment for taking bribe of Rs. 10.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently upheld its decision of not interfering with the order passed by the Disciplinary Authority, directing compulsory retirement of a court reader as punishment for taking bribe of Rs. 10.  The division bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice M.S. Bhatti was essentially dealing with a writ petition filed by the Petitioner seeking direction of the Court to quash the impugned orders of his punishment and arrears for the period of his suspension.  The facts of the case were that the Petitioner was working as Criminal Reader in the court of JFMC, Jabalpur. He was caught by Vigilance Authority of the Court taking bribe of Rs.10 from the Complainant. Corollary to the same, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Classification Control and Appeal) Rules 1966, an inquiry was initiated, wherein as many as three charges were leveled against him. The Disciplinary Authority held him guilty of all the three charges and directed his compulsory retirement from the post as punishment. The Appellate Authority also upheld his punishment. The Petitioner then preferred a Review Petition before the Court, wherein he was exonerated of two charges but the bribery charge of Rs. 10 was upheld, and therefore, his punishment was not interfered with.  The Petitioner asserted that he was being made a scapegoat by the Complainant and that there was no evidence against him to establish his guilt. He then submitted that no trap could have been laid by the employer since such power is vested exclusively with the Lokayukt. He further argued that since the Court had dropped two out of three charges against him, the penalty inflicted upon him was disproportionate to the alleged misconduct.  Per contra, the State submitted that the orders imposing penalty were just and proper. It was further argued that the Disciplinary Authority, while considering every document of the disciplinary proceedings, had come to a conclusion that the Petitioner not fit to be retained in service. Thus, considering the seriousness of the charges, it imposed the penalty of compulsory retirement.  The State also argued that interference with departmental inquiry can be made by the Writ Court if the inquiry was held by an incompetent authority or was conducted against the procedure prescribed or in the event of violation of principles of natural justice. Therefore, since none of the eventualities was available in the present case, it was submitted that the petition was liable to be dismissed.  Examining the submissions of parties and the documents on record, the Court noted that contrary to the claims of the Petitioner, the case in hand contained ample evidence against him. Conversely, the Court observed that the Petitioner had pressurized the Complainant to not testify against him-  The above admission of the complainant not only completely demolishes the entire defence of the petitioner but also compels us to draw adverse inference against the petitioner inasmuch as he himself was guilty of abuse of the process by attempting to pressurize the witness. Thus, it cannot be said that its a case of no evidence. The complainant categorically stated in his complaint and also the statement which  was recorded on 21/07/2008 (Ex.P/5C) itself that the petitioner had told him to bring Rs.10/- on the next date and thus accordingly on the next date of hearing, he gave bribe of Rs.10/- to the petitioner.  Accordingly, the Court concluded-  Thus, in our considered view, there was ample evidence against the petitioner and particularly looking to his conduct even during the course of inquiry, when he made an attempt to mount undue pressure upon the complainant to give favourable testimony, therefore, petitioner's submission that the procedure laid down for holding the departmental inquiry was vitiated or the case in hand is a case of no evidence, is ill founded.  With the aforesaid observations, the Court held that based on the evidence brought on record, the Disciplinary Authority rightly passed the order of compulsory retirement, which was in consonance with the gravity of charges leveled against the Petitioner. It further observed that the said part of the order was rightly affirmed by the Appellate Authority. Resultantly, the petition was dismissed.

A committee constituted by the Calcutta High Court on Friday submitted a report on the alleged irregularities in appointments of Group-C posts in the state government-run schools in West Bengal on the purported recommendation by the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC).  A Division Bench had earlier set up an inquiry committee headed by Justice Ranjit Kumar Bagh, former judge of the Calcutta High Court to probe into the recruitment scam. The other members of the committee includes Asutosh Ghosh, Member of West Bengal School Service Commission, Paromita Roy, Deputy Secretary (Administration), West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and advocate Arunava Banerjee, a practicing lawyer of the High Court. The Court appointed committee apprised a Bench comprising Justice Ananda Kumar Mukherjee and Justice Subrata Talukdar that 381 appointments for Group-C posts in the state government-run schools in West Bengal were made illegally.  Furthermore, the committee recommended criminal proceedings against four ex-state SSC officials and the incumbent president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. It also sought disciplinary proceedings against six other former senior SSC officials.  Advocate Arunabha Bandopadhyay, a member of the committee submitted the report before the Division Bench and stated that massive irregularities were committed in giving appointments to the 381 candidates after flouting existing rules and procedures.  The report further averred that a five-member panel constituted in 2019 by the order of the Joint Secretary to the Government of West Bengal, Education Department to oversee the recruitment of close to 13,000 non-teaching staff in government-aided schools did not have any legal validity. The 5 members of the panel were- S. P. Sinha, Advisor to the West Bengal Central School Service Commission - the Convenor, S. Acharya, Personal Secretary to Minister in Charge of the Department, P. K. Bandyopadhyay, OSD to the MIC of Education Department, A. K. Sarkar, Deputy Director (GA Section), Directorate of School Education Department, T. Panja, Senior Law Officer of the department.  Accordingly, the Court appointed committee recommended penal action to be taken against former SSC Chairman Saumitra Sarkar, former SSC secretary Ashok Saha, and S Acharya, who was the programme officer of SSC, besides SP Sinha and Kalyanmoy Ganguly. Pursuant to the submissions, the Division Bench observed that it would pass its judgment in the matter on May 18.  "Mr. Arunava Banerjee, Learned Advocate and Member of the Committee of Enquiry appointed by the Hon'ble Court ( R.K. Bag Committee) for enquiring into the alleged illegal appointments under the School Service Commission pursuant to RLST-2016, submits and places the Report of the Committee connected to appointments in Group-C Posts, in terms of the previous direction of this Court dated 13th April, 2022. The other appearing Learned Senior Counsel and Learned Counsel also place their submissions. Hearing stands accordingly concluded. To appear next for Judgement on the 18th of May, 2022 at the first sitting of the Court", the Court recorded in its order.  The Court appointed committee had earlier submitted its report in the court on alleged irregularities in the appointments of Group-D staff in State government run schools. Furthermore, the Court had earlier extended a stay for five weeks on an order of Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay that had the then Education Minister Partha Chatterjee to appear before the CBI for interrogation pertaining to the alleged recruitment scam.  Case Title: Dr Santi Prasad Sinha v. Laxmi Tunga and other connected matters     
The Supreme Court has held that a clause in an agreement barring payment of interest on amounts security deposit, earnest money deposit or any other amount will not be hit by Section 28 of the Contract Act. According to Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, a contract is void to the extent it restricts absolutely a party from enforcing his rights by usual proceedings in ordinary courts or if... The Supreme Court has held that a clause in an agreement barring payment of interest on amounts security deposit, earnest money deposit or any other amount will not be hit by Section 28 of the Contract Act.  According to Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, a contract is void to the extent it restricts absolutely a party from enforcing his rights by usual proceedings in ordinary courts or if it limits the time within which he may enforce his rights. Exception I to this section contains a rule that a contract by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which has arisen or which may arise between them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration is not illegal.  The case(Garg Builders Vs Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited LL 2021 SC 535) before the Supreme Court was related to the right of a party to seek pendente lite interest in an arbitration proceeding when the agreement had a clause barring the agreement. An argument was raised that the clause barring interest was violative of Section 28 of the Contract Act. Answering this issue, the Court noted that the payment of interest is governed by the Interest Act, 1978. The provisions of Section 3 (3) of the Interest Act, 1978 explicitly allows the parties to waive their claim to an interest by virtue of an agreement. Section 3(3)(a)(ii) states that the Interest Act will not apply to situations where the payment of interest is "barred by virtue of an express agreement". In this backdrop, the Court held that the clause in question was not violative of Section 28. A bench comprising Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari observed in the judgment as follows : "20. Exception I to Section 28 saves contracts where the right to move the Court for appropriate relief is restricted but where the parties have agreed to resolve their dispute through arbitration. Thus, a lawful agreement to refer the matter to arbitration can be made a condition precedent before going to courts and it does not violate Section 28. No cause of action then accrues until the Arbitrator has made the award and the only amount awarded in such arbitration is recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred. Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act which allows parties to waive any claim to interest including pendente lite and the power of the Arbitrator to grant interest is subject to the agreement of the parties.   21. It is pertinent to note that interest payments are governed in general by the Interest Act, 1978 in addition to the specific statutes that govern an impugned matter. Section 2 (a) of the Interest Act defines a "Court" which includes both a Tribunal and an Arbitrator. In turn, Section 3 allows a "Court" to grant interest at prevailing interest rates in various cases. The provisions of Section 3 (3) of the Interest Act, 1978 explicitly allows the parties to waive their claim to an interest by virtue of an agreement. Section 3(3)(a)(ii) states that the Interest Act will not apply to situations where the payment of interest is "barred by virtue of an express agreement".  22. Thus, when there is an express statutory permission for the parties to contract out of receiving interest and they have done so without any vitiation of free consent, it is not open for the Arbitrator to grant pendent lite interest. We are of the considered opinion that Clause 17 of the contract is not ultra vires in terms of Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872".

Refusing anticipatory bail to a man accused of forwarding a married woman's nude video to several people, the Bombay High Court observed that prima facie his alleged misdeed would be an offence under Section 67A of the Information Technology Act.  Section 67A prescribes the punishment for publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act.   Justice Bharati Dangre observed that the term 'sexually explicit' under section 67A of the IT Act wouldn't only mean the act of intercourse and may also include a nude video. Therefore, the court rejected the defence's submission that mere forwarding a nude video would not fall within the purview of 'sexually explicit' content and cited the Oxford dictionary meaning of "explicit," in support. The Court noted that Section 67A is a species of Section 67(which punishes transmission of obscene materials)  "The intention of the legislature in introducing Section 67, being publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form, cannot be restricted by construing the term 'sexually explicit' to only showing an activity of being indulging in sex," the Court observed. "The submission of the learned counsel that mere forwarding a nude video would not fall within the purview of 'sexually explicit" might not be correct", the order stated.  Justice Dangre added that the intention of the legislature was to do away exploitation of women or children or any person in electronic form by publishing or transmitting any obscene material.   Therefore, "the term 'sexually explicit', cannot be said to be not covering activity in respect of which the accusations are made," she added.   The court passed the order refusing anticipatory bail to a man booked under Section 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code on 13/04/2022.  The defence had cited a coordinate bench's judgement that had relied on the Black's Law Dictionary, regarding the meaning of 'explicit.' The dictionary meaning would be "Physical sexual activity or both persons engaged in sexual relations."   In response Justice Dangre said, that interpretation of the term 'sexually explicit activity' may be a matter of concern after the specific video is examined. But the man's custodial interrogation was necessary.   "Since the depiction of a woman in a nude form would definitely attract and would amount to obscene material and this being transmitted in electronic form, in my considered opinion, the accusations definitely require custodial interrogation of the applicant and the submission of the learned counsel for the applicant that Section 67-A prima facie does not attract does not hold the water at this stage."  The Case  The man approached the court for pre arrest bail after the Thane police booked him in April 2022. The 44-year-old woman in her complaint said she was married with two children. The accused, her husband's friend, was also a married man.   However, the two became intimate and while in the relationship, the accused asked for her nude video. The woman said she shared the video on the assurance that it would be deleted and the man had assured her that he had deleted the video. However, the accused's wife and daughter confronted her with the video in 2017, when she was invited to their house.   The woman said she severed ties with the man after the incident. However, after three years, the accused established contact with her again, threatening her with the old video. Despite acceding to his demands, not only she but even her husband and several other people received the video.  That's when the woman approached the police.

The Supreme Court on Monday ordered the constitution of a 3-member independent expert committee to probe into the allegations of widespread and targeted surveillance of activists, journalists, politicians and constitutional authorities using the Pegasus spyware. The committee will be headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice RV Raveendran. A Bench comprising the Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli on Monday expressed strong reservations against the practice of indiscriminate surveillance of individuals in a democracy that lead to a  'chilling effect' on the freedom of speech.  "In a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution", the Bench observed.  The Court also observed that surveillance will have a chilling effect on the freedom of press. The Court noted that the protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom of press. The judgment observed : "An important and necessary corollary of such a right is to ensure the protection of sources of information. Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom of the press. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest. Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potential chilling effect that snooping techniques may have, this Court's task in the present matter, where certain grave allegations of infringement of the rights of the citizens of the country have been raised, assumes great significance. In this light, this Court is compelled to take up the cause to determine the truth and get to the bottom of the allegations made herein". Any restriction on right to privacy must necessarily pass constitutional scrutiny  The Court acknowledged that while technology is a useful tool for improving the lives of the people, it can also lead to unreasonable State intrusions and breach the right to privacy of an individual. It was also categorically underscored that any any restrictions imposed on the right to privacy must necessarily pass constitutional scrutiny.  "Members of a civilized democratic society have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Privacy is not the singular concern of journalists or social activists. Every citizen of India ought to be protected against violations of privacy. It is this expectation which enables us to exercise our choices, liberties, and freedom", the Court further opined.  Interference with right to privacy must take place only when it is proportional and is absolutely necessary for protecting national security/interest  The Bench further enumerated that the State must at all times strive to achieve a balance between State's duty to protect national interests and infringement of privacy of citizens. Citing an instance, the Court lamented that in today's world, information gathered by intelligence agencies through surveillance is essential for the fight against violence and terror. However, any interference with the right to privacy of an individual must be carried out 'only when it is absolutely necessary for protecting national security/interest and is proportional', the Court highlighted. The considerations for usage of such alleged technology, ought to be evidence based, it was further noted.  It may be noted that during prior hearings, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued before the Bench that the instant matter was related to national security, and hence cannot be made a subject matter of a judicial debate or public discourse. He had further expressed the Centre's unwillingness to file any additional affidavit divulging whether the Centre had used any particular software for security purposes by citing concerns of national security.  Surveillance causes chilling effect on the freedom of press which is an important pillar of democracy  The Court further held that it is undeniable that surveillance and the knowledge that one is under the threat of being spied on can affect the way an individual decides to exercise his or her rights. This in many instances can lead to self-censorship, the Court pointed out.  Opining on the effect disproportionate State surveillance can have on the freedom of press, the Court remarked,  "This is of particular concern when it relates to the freedom of the press, which is an important pillar of democracy. Such chilling effect on the freedom of speech is an assault on the vital public-watchdog role of the press, which may undermine the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information." The Bench thus noted that it is compelled to 'take up the cause to determine the truth and get to the bottom of the allegations' in light of the pressing need to protect journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potential chilling effect that snooping techniques may have.  Also Read: 'Compelled To Determine Truth' : 7 Circumstances Cited By Supreme Court To Constitute Pegasus Committee State Won't Get A Free Pass By Mere Mention Of "National Security" : SC In Pegasus Case   Pegasus- All You Want To Know About Supreme Court Appointed Committee-Members, Terms Of Reference, Procedure  Case Details Case Title : Manohar Lal Sharma versus Union of India and connected cases  
YThe Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed a plea filed by former Aam Aadmi Party Councillor Tahir Hussain challenging charges framed against him in a money laundering case registered in connection with the North East Delhi riots of 2020. Justice Anu Malhotra observed that the alleged commission of a conspiracy "even for the purpose of GST violation in order to avail money" through criminal conspiracy for using proceeds of crime to commit 2020 riots and to cause unrest, prima facie falls within the ambit of commission of a scheduled offence under PMLA. "Apparently thus, the agreement to enter into an agreement to commit a crime, falls within the ambit of Section 120A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 falling thus, within the ambit of a scheduled offence," the court added. Furthermore, it was observed that the argument that there were no proceeds of crime attached will not be relevant as hatching a criminal conspiracy for violation of tax or laws for subsequent use of untainted money for funding riots would fall within the domain of commission of a criminal conspiracy, which is a standalone scheduled offence under PMLA. "In the circumstances, it is held that there is no infirmity in the impugned order dated 03.11.2022 of the learned Trial Court….," the court held. The court had heard Advocate Naveen Malhotra, who represented Tahir Hussain, and Zoheb Hossain, the counsel of Enforcement Directorate. The charges against Tahir Hussain were framed earlier this month by the city's Karkardooma Court under Section 3, which is punishable under Section 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.  Hussain's counsel had submitted that while earning money out of scheduled offences is a core requirement under PMLA, no such ingredient was met in the matter. The counsel also said that no property or proceeds of crime was seized from Hussain which could justify the framing of charges against him for money laundering. On the other hand, the ED had argued that bank accounts allegedly used by Hussain will be property within the meaning of section 8(5) of the PMLA, adding that such property is also liable to be confiscated. ED had further submitted that there was an alleged conspiracy to fund the riots in which fake bills were prepared and cash was later given to various persons to commit the offences. It was also argued that there was enough material to show that property and proceeds of crime were used in furtherance of a larger conspiracy to fund the riots. According to the Enforcement Directorate, Hussain "hatched a conspiracy with his associates to fraudulently withdraw money" from the accounts of certain companies — M/s. Show Effect Advertisement Pvt. Ltd. (SEAPL), M/s. Essence Cellcom Pvt. Ltd. (ECPL) and M/s. Essence Global Services Pvt. Ltd. (EGSPL), "owned and controlled" by him "through bogus and malafide transactions with bogus entry operator on the strength of fake bills". The ED's case is that he was the ultimate beneficiary of laundered money and used it during the riots in North- East Delhi in February 2020. The PMLA case was registered on the basis of the three FIRs lodged in relation to the riots - FIR No. 59/2020, FIR No. 65/2020 and FIR No. 88/2020. While framing charges, the trial court observed that ED's complaint "made out a case" of Hussain working in conspiracy with Amit Gupta in generating proceeds of crime which was then put to use by the former for the "purpose of riots". Perusing the contents of the complaint, accompanying documents and statements of witnesses, the trial court had observed that prima facie Hussain, while acting in conspiracy, engaged in the offence of money laundering. The proceeds of crime generated in the conspiracy was put to use for riots, the judge added. Title: Tahir Hussain v. ED    
The Supreme Court set aside a bail granted by Allahabad High Court to a rape accused.'We are disturbed to notice the manner in which the High Court has casually released the accused on bail despite having noted that he was involved in other serious offences and had committed offence even while on bail', the bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy said while... The Supreme Court set aside a bail granted by Allahabad High Court to a rape accused. 'We are disturbed to notice the manner in which the High Court has casually released the accused on bail despite having noted that he was involved in other serious offences and had committed offence even while on bail', the bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy said while directing that the accused shall remain in jail in connection with another crime registered during the pendency of the trial of this case. Rizwan was charged under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Before the High Court, the accused had contended that the victim is aged about 17-18 years and she was having relationship with him on the false promises by him to marry with her. It was further contended that the victim understand the future and pre-marriage sex, even after knowing its result she was in consensual relationship from last one year with her fiancée. Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the High Court had found it to be a fit case for bail. Following this order, he was released on bail but again got arrested in connection with some other offence.  "It is reported that accused was released on bail after the High Court order but came to be arrested in connection with some other offence. That makes no difference. In our opinion, the impugned judgment cannot stand the test of judicial scrutiny." the bench observed while allowing the appeal filed by victim.  Read Order         
Dismissing the appeal filed by Zakia Jafri challenging the clean chit given by the SIT to Narendra Modi and 63 other state functionaries in the Gujarat riots case, the Supreme Court observed that conspiracy cannot be inferred on the basis of mere failure or inaction of the state administration. "Conspiracy cannot be readily inferred merely on the basis of the inaction or failure of the State administration", the Court stated. It added that "inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration cannot be the basis to infer a pre- planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence) against the minority community". The Court observed that the Special Investigation Team had noted that inaction and negligence of the erring officials has been taken note of at the appropriate level including by initiating departmental action against them. "Such inaction or negligence cannot pass the muster of hatching of a criminal conspiracy, for which the degree of participation in the planning of commission of an offence of this magnitude must come to the fore in some way. The SIT was not there to enquire into the failures of the State administration, but the remit given to it by this Court was to enquire into the allegations of larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level)", the judgment delivered by a bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar. The bench was addresing the arguments raised by Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal for Jafri that there was failure of the state administration and police machinery in taking appropirate action to control the rioters and that the intelligence inputs regarding communal build-up were ignored. The bench observed that "to make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a link indicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State". It added that "no such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine (9) cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of this Court". The bench reiterated that the inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials per se does not imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities. The failure to act upon messages of intelligence agencies "cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State". The Court said that the events after the Godhra train carnage took place in "quick succession" and that on the very next day, February 28, 2002, additional support of Army had been called for and curfew was imposed in distrubed areas. The Court added that the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi had given repeated pulblic assurances that guilty will be punished. "In light of such timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy", the judgment stated. "The protagonists of quest for justice sitting in a comfortable environment in their air-conditioned office may succeed in connecting failures of the State administration at different levels during such horrendous situation, little knowing or even referring to the ground realities and the continual effort put in by the duty holders in controlling the spontaneous evolving situation unfolding aftermath mass violence across the State", the judgment further said. Misgovernence for a brief period may not be a case of breakdown of constitutional machinery The Court said that collapsing of state administration in times of emergency is not an unknown phenomenon and cited the examples of governments with the best of the facilities crumbling under pressure during COVID pandemic. "Can it be said to be a case of hatching of criminal conspiracy?", the Court asked. "Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration,cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis. To put it differently, misgovernance or failure to maintain law-and-order during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Article 356 of the Constitution. There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation", the Court stated. Discards allegations of Sanjiv Bhat, Haren Pandya and RB Sreekumar The Court discarded that the alllegations made by Sanjiv Bhat IPS, then Gujarat Minister Haren Pandya, then ADGP RB Sreekumar regarding a meeting chaired by the then Chief Minister on February 27. "We find force in the argument of the respondent-State that the testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood. For, persons not privy to the stated meeting, where utterances were allegedly made by the then Chief Minister, falsely claimed themselves to be eye-witnesses and after thorough investigation by the SIT, it has become clear that their claim of being present in the meeting was itself false to their knowledge. On such false claim, the structure of larger criminal conspiracy at the highest level has been erected. The same stands collapsed like a house of cards, aftermath thorough investigation by the SIT", the Court said. Lauds SIT probe; says those who abused process to "keep pot boiling" must be put in dock As concluding remarks, the Court said : "While parting, we express our appreciation for the indefatigable work done by the team of SIT officials in the challenging circumstances they had to face and yet, we find that they have come out with flying colours unscathed. At the end of the day, it appears to us that a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others was to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge. The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT after a thorough investigation. Intriguingly, the present proceedings have been pursued for last 16 years (from submission of complaint dated 8.6.2006 running into 67 pages and then by filing protest petition dated 15.4.2013 running into 514 pages) including with the audacity to question the integrity of every functionary involved in the process of exposing the devious stratagem adopted (to borrow the submission of learned counsel for the SIT), to keep the pot boiling, obviously, for ulterior design. As a matter of fact, all those involved in such abuse of process, need to be in the dock and proceeded with in accordance with law". Jafri, the widow of Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who got killed in the Gulberg Society massacre during the 2002 Gujarat riots, filed the special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenging the October 2017 judgment of the Gujarat High Court which accepted the closure report filed by the SIT regarding larger conpiracy allegations against the state administration. However, the High Court granted liberty to Jafri to seek further investigation. The Supreme Court held that there is no material for further investigtaion as well and that the SIT's closure report should be accepted as it is, without anything more. "The question of further investigation would have arisen only on the availability of new material/information in connection with the allegation of larger conspiracy at the highest level, which is not forthcoming in this case. Hence, the final report, as submitted by the SIT, ought to be accepted as it is, without doing anything more", it said.

The Madras High Court recently remarked that information technology today is posing a great challenge in upbringing of teenagers, whose minds are often affected by easily accessible pornography, misleading them and making them indulge in sexual offences without understanding its consequences. The Madurai bench of Justice J Nisha Banu and Justice N Anand Venkatesh emphasized that... The Madras High Court recently remarked that information technology today is posing a great challenge in upbringing of teenagers, whose minds are often affected by easily accessible pornography, misleading them and making them indulge in sexual offences without understanding its consequences.  The Madurai bench of Justice J Nisha Banu and Justice N Anand Venkatesh emphasized that whenever these teenagers are arrested, efforts should be made to attend to their mental perversity. The court thus observed as under:  The teanagers, who are easily exposed to pornography even from their mobile phones, get confused and mislead at an age where they are in the grips of hormonal changes and they indulge in activities without understanding its consequences. Once these teanagers are arrested and kept inside the prison, efforts must be taken to attend to their mental perversion. The purpose of confining a teanager in the prison is not to abandon him and throw him out of the main stream of the society and all steps must be taken to reform such a person.  The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the father of 18 years old boy who was detained by the District Collector, holding him to be "Sexual Offender" under Section 2(ggg) of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Cyber Law offenders, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Sand Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Slum-Grabbers and Video Pirates Act 1982.  The order of the District Collector was challenged on the ground that there was gross violation of procedural safeguards as the representation made by the petitioner was not considered on time and there was inordinate and unexplained delay. It was submitted that there was a delay of 5 days in submitting the remarks by the  Detaining Authority and a delay of 21 days in considering the representation.   The State, however, submitted that though there was a delay in considering the representation, no prejudice has been caused to the detenue and thus there was no violation of fundamental rights under Article 21 and 22 of the Constitution.  The court was convinced that there was inordinate and unexplained delay. In view of the decision of the Supreme Court and the Madras High Court emphasising on procedural safeguards and holding detention to be illegal whenever there was inordinate delay, the court was incline to quash the impugned detention order.   It also suggested the State Government to up with some mechanism whereby, offenders of this nature are properly counselled when they are in prison and when they come out of the prison, they are reformed and they are able to lead a normal life.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently upheld the view taken by the lower court that when signature over a cheque in question has not been specifically denied then there is no question for the appointment of a handwriting expert to compare the handwriting over the cheque in question. With this, the Bench of Justice Vinod S. Bhardwaj dismissed the plea filed by one Sudhir Kumar challenging the order of the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Sohna, Gurugram rejecting petitioner's application for appointment of a Hand-Writing Expert to obtain an expert opinion about writing on the cheque. The case in brief In the instant case, the respondent-complainant had based his complaint alleging therein that the petitioner had issued the cheque in October 2016 for an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- in the discharge of his liability, however, the counsel for the petitioner argued that he had never issued the said cheque nor there was any liability to be discharged by him.  It is the case of the petitioner that the husband of the petitioner and the respondent were doing business together and it was at the said relevant period of time that the petitioner gave the cheque to the respondent as a security for their mutual transactions and business of property dealing.  It is the further case of the petitioner that the cheque in question was not signed by the petitioner and the same had been handed over as a blank cheque and there was no legally enforceable debt. Before the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, the petitioner filed an application for the appointment of a handwriting expert at the stage of evidence of defence, however, the Court rejected the same as it noted that when signature over the cheque in question had not been specifically denied then there was no question for appointment of a handwriting expert to compare the handwriting over the cheque in question.  This view was also upheld by the Additional Sessions Judge, Gurugram in revision. Challenging both the orders, the petitioner had moved to the HC. High Court's observations Against this backdrop, hearing the plea of the petitioner, the High Court was of the conclusive opinion that when the petitioner had already admitted his signatures on the cheque in question, the subsequent issue as to who filled up the cheque can be examined at the time of final adjudication and that is no need to appoint an expert at the instant stage. In view of this, the Court opined that the impugned orders do not suffer from any illegality, irregularity, perversity, or result in failure of justice by non-examination of the Hand-Writing Expert in the facts of the instant case. "Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to refer to any provision in law as per which the handwriting on cheque must necessarily be that of the signatory or to any judgment that would hold that once the signatures on cheque are admitted, filing of the cheque in a different handwriting itself would be a sufficient ground to rule against a cheque having been issued in due course," added the Court as it dismissed the plea. Case title - SUDHIR KUMAR v. PADAM SINGH   
The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently upheld the award passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, whereby the Insurance Company was directed to pay compensation to the legal representatives of the deceased, despite the insurance policy being bought after the death of the policy owner.  Deciding the appeal preferred by the Insurance Company against the impugned award, Justice Vishal Dhagat held that the Company did not exercise ordinary care and diligence in the case-  Since, owner-Urmila Uikey has died, therefore, she could not have appeared for signing application and proposal for purchase of policy. Insurance Company made no efforts to find out why Insured has not appeared and signed the application. Insurer could have discovered the truth by ordinary diligence following proper procedure for issuing of policy.  The facts of the case were that the policy owner/deceased had met with a fatal accident while travelling in a car registered under her name. The said car was insured by the Appellant Company in the favour of the deceased. The Insurance company was challenging the award passed by the Claims Tribunal in favour of the legal representatives of the policy owner/deceased.  The Appellant company submitted that the policy owner had died more than two and a half years before the policy was bought. It was argued that since there cannot be any contract between a dead and living person, the said insurance policy was null and void and Claims Tribunal had committed an error in fixing liability on them to indemnify the owner and pay the legal representatives of deceased.   Examining the submissions of the parties and documents on record, the Court noted that despite the misrepresentation on the part of the legal representatives in contracting with the Appellant, the contract was not voidable-  In this case as owner has died before purchasing insurance policy, therefore, there was a misrepresentation on the part of legal representatives/driver/owner of vehicle in contracting with the appellant for purchase of policy in name of deceased owner Urmila Uikey. Contract entered between the parties is not voidable as consent given by appellant for covering the risk on purchase of policy was given by misrepresentation or silence hiding the fact that Urmila Uikey has died as appellant had means to discover the truth with ordinary diligence.  The Court further observed that the Appellant Company received the money and issued the policy without carrying out due diligence. The Court also pointed out that even during the pendency of the case, no effort was made for declaring policy to be void or to cancel the same. Therefore, the Court concluded, the policy could not be held to be voidable at option of the Appellant Company. Finding no in the impugned award, the Court dismissed the appeal.   Case Title : NATIONAL INSURANCE CO. LTD v SMT. GUDDI BAI AND ANRS.   
A US District Judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Hindu American Foundation (HAF) alleging defamation by five defendants. The lawsuit was filed in the District Court of Columbia against co-founders of Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR) Sunita Vishwanath and Raju Rajagopal, Executive Director of Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) Rasheed Ahmed, Chairman of Federation of Indian American Christian Organizations of North America (FIACONA) John Prabhudoss, and Rutgers University Professor Audrey Truschke. The case pertained to two online articles published by aljazeera.com, an online news platform operated by Al Jazeera Media Network. The articles concerned federal COVID-19 relief payments and loans distributed to five U.S.-based groups allegedly linked to Hindu nationalist organizations in India. HAF was one of the groups mentioned in the articles. HAF alleged that the Defendants conspired to publish allegedly false and defamatory statements and that the statements caused substantial injury to HAF, including lost donations and reputation damage. The First Story in question had the headline "Hindu right-wing groups in US got $833,000 of federal COVID fund" and sub-headline "Five groups linked to Hindu nationalist organisations in India received direct payments and loans in federal relief fund." It described HAF as an advocacy group that "lobbies to deflect any criticism of [the] Modi government's policies on Capitol Hill" and "has open links with [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] (RSS) members." The Second Story in question had the headline "Call for US probe into Hindu right-wing groups getting COVID fund" and the sub-headline "Following an Al Jazeera report, US-based Coalition to Stop Genocide in India demanded investigation into federal funds given to 'sponsor hate.'" In the Second Story, the HAF was described as "US-based front organisations for Hindutva, the supremacist ideology that is the driving force behind much of the persecution of Christians, Muslims, Dalits, and other minorities in India."  It is pertinent to note that the defendants in the case were not the publishers or the authors of the articles but people who were either quoted in the articles or who had tweeted/shared the said articles.  The Defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim. Accepting the preliminary objections raised by the Defendants, the Court allowed their motion to dismiss the suit. No actual malice pleaded The court further stated that it could not plausibly infer that any of the statements of the defendants were made with actual malice. The only allegation HAF points to in support of malice is the existence of publicly available financial statements. These allegations, as per the court, were not enough to sustain a claim. "..this court finds that HAF fails to plead actual malice and thus fails to state a claim of defamation against all Defendants", the order passed by District Judge Amit Mehta stated. Statements not verifiable false; they are statements of opinion The order further stated : "Furthermore, the court has reviewed the allegedly defamatory statements attributed to Defendants Viswanath, Rajagopal, Ahmed, and Truschke, and finds that HAF fails to plausibly plead that any statement made by any defendant is verifiably false. Most of the statements are clearly statements of opinion. For example, Defendant Viswanath is quoted in the First Story stating: "Any American non-profit that perpetuates Islamophobia and other forms of hate should not receive federal relief funds in any form." Compl. This is a nonactionable statement of opinion—Viswanath is expressing her view on what types of organizations are deserving of federal relief funds. Defendant Ahmed is quoted in the Second Story stating: "US taxpayers' money being used to keep hate groups in business is absolutely unacceptable and should concern all who believe in fairness, justice and government accountability." This is another clear statement of opinion expressing a view on how government funding should be distributed, and which groups are deserving of federal relief funds. (Defendant Rajagopal stating: "The rise of HAF and other organisations linked with Hindutva has emboldened Hindu supremacist organizations in India, while also stifling the moderate Hindu voices here in the US."); (Defendant Truschke tweeting: "As a scholar of South Asia, I can attest that some of these groups spread hate & use intimidation tactics. These things are dangerous and unwelcome on US soil"). For the stated reasons, HAF fails to plausibly plead that any statement made by any defendant is verifiably false". Some statements arguably false, but not defamatory The court further stated that "some of Truschke's statements are arguably verifiably false. See e.g., ("Full disclosure that the HAF Board member in question [Rajiv Pandit] has been going after me, along with a growing list of people, in recent days."). Nevertheless, even if proven false, HAF's defamation claim fails because the statement is not defamatory, the Court said. The court further noted that Viswanath's claim that HAF has "parent organisations" in India is plausibly verifiably false. Nevertheless, the plausible falsehood of this claim does not save HAF's defamation claim against Viswanath, it said. As per the order– "Plaintiff alleges a common law civil conspiracy claim against all Defendants for conspiring to "defame HAF" by "causing false and disparaging statements about HAF to be published in the First and Second Stories." Civil conspiracy is not a standalone tort and "thus fails unless the elements of the underlying tort are satisfied." Because the underlying defamation claim against Prabhudoss fails, Plaintiff's civil conspiracy claim fails." Accordingly, the defamation lawsuit was dismissed.  CASE TITLE: Hindu American Foundation v. Sunita Vishwanath        
The Supreme Court of India has held that ex parte enhancement of sentence by the High Court is against the statutory mandate of the law under CrPC that provides for an opportunity to show case before enhancement of sentence in criminal revision.A Bench compromising Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Bela Trivedi set aside Madras High Court's order that enhanced the sentences imposed on... The Supreme Court of India has held that ex parte enhancement of sentence by the High Court is against the statutory mandate of the law under CrPC that provides for an opportunity to show case before enhancement of sentence in criminal revision. A Bench compromising Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Bela Trivedi set aside Madras High Court's order that enhanced the sentences imposed on the appellants without any legal representation on his behalf and without appointing an Amicus Curiae in the case "It appears the ex parte enhancement of sentence is against the statutory mandate of the law as delineated in the conjoint reading of Section 401(1) and first proviso to Section 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. These sections adumbrate an opportunity of showing cause before enhancement of sentence in criminal revision", the Bench said. It may be noted that Section 401 of CrPC which provides for High Court's power of revision states that no order under the section can be made to the prejudice of the accused or other person unless he has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by pleader in his own defence. The Proviso to Section 386 which deals with Powers of appellate court states that the sentence shall not be enhanced unless the accused has had an opportunity of showing cause against such enhancement. In the present matter, where only the petitioner and State were heard and the Court did not have the benefit of the arguments on behalf of the appellant accused, the Bench observed that the High Court was wrong in not appointing an Amicus Curiae. The Bench observed that in case of no legal representation on behalf of the accused the High court ought to have appointed an Amicus Curiae in the absence of counsel as observed by the Supreme Court in the case of Parveen v. State of Haryana. Referring to its judgement in the case of Govind Ramji Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra which mandates that the High Court should give the accused a reasonable opportunity of showing cause, the Bench set aside High Court's order dated 24.10.2018 and remanded the matter back to the High Court to decide the revision petition afresh. With regard to High Court's observation that notice had been served to appellants, the Bench observed that there is lack of clarity on when the notice was actually served and whether the appellants were informed that the criminal revision will be taken up for final hearing. The present special leave petition was filed challenging the Madras High Court's order in a criminal revision enhancing the sentences imposed on the appellants for offences under Sections 341, 294(b), 506(ii) and 447 of the Indian Penal Code. The impugned order was passed in a criminal revision petition by the victim against the judgment and order of sentence passed by the Court of Principal Sessions Judge, Vellore District dated 4th December 2006. When the revision petition came up for hearing after almost five years on 24th October 2018, the impugned order was passed mentioning that the notice had been served to the appellants and their names had been printed in the cause list but there was no representation on their behalf. 
The Karnataka High Court has suggested that the Central Government make necessary amendments to Section 372 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in order to provide an opportunity to victims to approach the Court in appeal seeking enhancement of sentence imposed on a convict.  A single judge bench of Justice H P Sandesh said, "No doubt, when the remedy provided to the State to file an appeal in the event of inadequate sentence, It requires consideration to suitably amend Section 372 of Cr.P.C., conferring the right to the victim also to file an appeal making necessary amendment to Section 372 of Cr.P.C, or otherwise it is a discrimination against the victim, when the appeal is provided to the State."  It added, "Hence, it is appropriate to direct the Central Government to make necessary amendment to provide an opportunity to the victim also to approach the Court for seeking an enhancement of sentence and the said right of anomaly under the provisions of Section 372 of Cr.P.C., requires to be set right, for insertion of a right to a victim to question the order of sentence and seek for an enhancement of sentence."  Presently under section 372 of Cr.P.C, the victim is qualified to file an appeal in the event of acquittal of the accused or conviction for lesser offence or for imposing inadequate compensation only.  The bench made this suggestion while dismissing a criminal revision petition filed by the original complainant, former IAS officer BA Harish Gowda seeking to enhance the sentence of nine months imposed on Ravi Kumar, Editor, Publisher and Printer of Parivala Pathrike Journal, who was convicted under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code.  Instead, it allowed the revision petition filed by the accused and set aside the order of the lower appellate court which enhanced the sentence of six months imposed on the accused by the trial court to nine months, on an appeal filed by the complainant.  The bench said, "In the case on hand, the appeal was filed under Section 374 of Cr.P.C., before the Trial Court and under Section 374 of Cr.P.C., no such provision is provided to file an appeal by the victim against the order of the Trial Court for enhancement of sentence. No doubt, there is a provision under Section 372 of Cr.P.C, the same is also not provided for an appeal for enhancement of sentence. Hence, the Appellate Court ought not to have entertained the said appeal for enhancement of sentence and committed an error in enhancing the sentence when the statute does not provide such an appeal."  It added, "No statutory provision is provided to the victim to file an appeal, the revision filed by the complainant against the order of the Appellate Court and the Trial Court for lesser sentence, is not maintainable. Consequently, the revision filed by the accused deserves to be allowed and the order of the Appellate Court requires it to be set aside."  Case Details:  On the complaint made by Gowda against the accused in the year 2000, the accused after a long drawn litigation was found guilty by the trial court on judgment dated 30.08.2017, the Trial Court convicted the accused and sentenced him for a period of 6 months for the offence under Section 500 of IPC and imposed fine of Rs.25,000.  Following which the complainant as well as the accused filed an appeal. The complainant, in his appeal sought for an order to enhance the sentence and the accused in his appeal questioned the conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court.  The Appellate Court, dismissed the appeal filed by the accused and allowed the appeal filed by the complainant, however modified the sentence enhancing the imprisonment for a period of 9 months with a fine of Rs.10,000/-. Being aggrieved by the order of modification of sentence, these three revision petitions are filed by the accused as well as the complainant.  Complainant's submissions:   It was said the accused had indulged in making false imputations in the journal and the document on record reveals that it is defamatory per-se which fact has not been rebutted by the accused either before the Trial Court or before the Appellate Court or before this Court in these petitions or on the earlier occasions.  The false and concocted imputations directed against the complainant by the accused are not only defamatory, but they are also very grave in nature meant to ensure deep impact on the minds of the reader and words will not be sufficient to describe the mental agony, humiliation and physical hardship undergone by the complainant in the past 20 years. The very nature of false imputations reproduced in the complaint is sufficient to prove that the punishment imposed upon the accused to convict is insufficient.  Further relying on several judgments of the Supreme Court, it was said that the accused has not been examined before the Trial Court to prove either good faith or the imputations have been made for public good.  Accused on the other hand argued that the entire facts does not reveal that there is no intention to damage the reputation of the respondent, the appellants did not have any intention or mens rea to commit the offence under Section 500 of IPC. This fact has not been considered by both the Courts and also not considered the cross-examination of P.Ws.1 and 2 and failed to consider his defence.  It was further submitted that the appeal filed by the respondent complainant under Section 374(3) of CrPC itself is not maintainable because Section 374 of CrPC provides for an appeal against the conviction and the complainant does not have any right to file an appeal. It is also contended that the alleged defamatory statement was published in the year 2000 and 20 years have elapsed and the accused is put to great hardship.  The very appeal filed before the Appellate Court is not maintainable but, the Appellate Court enhanced the sentence erroneously even without jurisdiction.  Court findings:  The court though dismissed the petition filed by the complainant seeking enhancement of sentence it upheld the order of the trial court convicting the accused to suffer six months imprisonment under section 500 IPC.  It said, "Though defence was taken in the cross-examination that the said article was published with good faith and for the benefit of the public good, in order to substantiate the same, no material is placed before the Court."  The court opined, "It is also important to note that the complainant also fought before the Court almost from the last two decades to prove the fact that his reputation has been spoiled on account of the defamatory per-se allegations made against him and these aspects are also considered by both the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court. "  It then held, "When the material has been considered by the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court and given finding on the basis of the evidence available on record, it cannot be said that the order passed by both the Courts are perverse and no material on record to substantiate the same."  It added, "When such being the case and when the accused has also not led any evidence before the Trial Court to substantiate his contention that the same was made with good faith and for the public good, both the Courts have not committed any error while appreciating the material on record and have given anxious consideration to the evidence available on record."  Accordingly it dismissed the appeal filed by the complaint seeking enhancement of sentence of 9 months and quashed and set aside the appellate court order which enhanced the sentence from six months to nine months. The bench also confirmed the order of the trial court which convicted the accused and sentenced him to 6 months imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs.10,000.  Further it directed the Registry to send this copy of the judgment to the Ministry of justice to examine and do the needful, as observed in the judgment while answering point Nos.(i) and (ii) regarding anomaly in the statute to set right of appeal to the victim for necessary amendment to provide right of appeal to the victim for enhancement of sentence.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday refused to quash the criminal case against a government teacher and a madrasa teacher from whose possession cow meat (beef) and 16 live cattle were recovered. The Bench Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal observed that the First Information Report (FIR) that prima facie cognizable offence is made out against the applicants and thus, no case was made out to quash the case against them. The case in brief The Court was dealing with the 482 CrPC plea filed by 4 applicants booked under Sections 153- A, 420, 429, 188, 269, 270, 273 I.P.C. and section 3/5/8 of Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955 and section 11 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1979 and section 7/8 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 seeking to quash the case.  Applicant no. 1 is an Assistant Teacher in the education department of the State, while applicant no. 2 is also working as Assistant Teacher in Madrasa Darul Ulum Gausia Kasba Salempur, while applicant no. 3 is running a medical shop and applicant no. 4 is Hafiz Quran. It was their submission that a report from the Forensic Investigation Laboratory had received did not disclose that the sample sent for analysis was of the cow. It was their case that no case under the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act was made out.  On the other hand, the State counsel argued that the FIR is a detailed report which categorically mentioned that out of 16 live cattle stock which included 7 buffaloes, 1 cow, 2 female buffalo's calf, 5 male buffalo's calf, and one male cow-calf.  Thus, it was argued by the state that it was wrong to say that the FSL report gave a clean chit to the applicants, as 16 cattle were found in the possession of the applicants and other co-accused and they were not having any license to run the slaughterhouse. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court discarded the argument of the applicants that no offence was made out from the reading of the First Information Report, as the Court underscored that even though the FSL report had revealed that the sample which was sent for chemical analysis was not cow meat, but, 16 live cattle were also recovered from the custody of the applicants and another co-accused. "I find from the perusal of the First Information Report that prima facie cognizable offence is made out against the applicants and only the report of the lab about the chemical analysis of the sample which was sent having been found not to be cow meat but 16 live stock cattle have been found in the custody of the applicants along with other materials, a list of which has been given in First Information Report and there being no license with the applicants for running slaughterhouse, prima facie, the offence is made out and charge sheet having been submitted, and there being serious allegations, no ground is made out for quashing the proceedings..." Consequently, observing that defence regarding the FSL report shall be considered by the trial court as such defence set up in the present application cannot be considered by this Court at this stage, at the stage of quashing of the charge sheet. With this, the case was dismissed. Case title - Parvez Ahmad And 3 Others v. State of U.P. and Another [APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 17024 of 2022]

Appointment on compassionate ground offered to... The Delhi High Court has reiterated that an appointment on compassionate ground offered to the dependant of a deceased employee is a mere concession and not a right. A single judge bench of Justice Chandra Dhari Singh observed, "The whole object behind granting compassionate employment is to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis. Appointment on compassionate ground offered to a dependant of a deceased employee is an exception to the said rule. It is a concession and not a right." The petitioner in this case was the wife of an en employee of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd who passed away while in service due to a Road accident. Through the petition, the petitioner sought compassionate employment for her son under the Rule 7(b)(ii)/8A of the HPCL Employee's Superannuation Benefit Fund Scheme, as per which she was entitled to the benefits as her deceased husband would have received had he superannuated.  The petitioner sought the benefits of the scheme in the year 2008, after her husband expired, however, the scheme was withdrawn and discontinued by the respondent corporation in the year 2004. The fact of the discontinuation of the scheme was duly intimated to the petitioner. Despite the communications, the petitioner sought to avail the benefits of the scheme.  Additionally, the petitioner was given an option to choose from the three Schemes of the Respondent Corporation when she first approached it after her husband expired and she, with her own will and volition, opted for the benefits under Rule 7(b)(ii)/8A of the Scheme. When she could not avail the benefits under the scheme, she approached the court The petitioner relied on Director of Education (Secondary) v. Pushpendra Kumar, (1998) 5 SCC 192, where the Supreme Court had held that a provision for grant of compassionate employment was to enable the family of the deceased employee to tide over the sudden crisis resulting due to death of the bread earner which has left the family in penury. Per contra, the respondent submitted that the petitioner had opted for Rule 7(b)(ii)/ 8A (100% benefit till employment is given) of the Scheme and was accordingly given an amount of Rs. 58,88,990/- (including EPF, Gratuity, Annuity, Pension GPAI etc). Further, as far as consideration of the case of the son of the petitioner for compassionate appointment was concerned, HPCL/ Respondent Corporation had withdrawn the scheme of providing appointment on compassionate grounds in August, 2004 itself.  The court noted that the petitioner had, only after having opted for benefits under Rule 7(b)(ii)/8A of the Scheme, approached Respondent Corporation seeking compassionate employment for her son. It was found that after waiving the other options as given to her by the Respondent Corporation, she could not have sought to avail the benefit at a later stage. The court opined that the object behind granting compassionate employment was to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis. It further held that– "The petitioner had availed the monetary benefits, under the scheme opted by her, to the tune of Rs. 58 lakhs. Having received such benefits, the family of the deceased service man would have survived and revived from the crisis that took upon them by surprise. After the effects of such crisis mitigated by the reason of her opting the scheme under Rule 7(b)(ii)/8A, the petitioner did not have the entitlement to approach under the Scheme of compassionate employment since the very purpose of the scheme was surpassed." In light of the same, the petition was dismissed for being devoid of any merit. CASE TITLE: MANJU DEVI v. HINDUSTAN PETROLEUM CORPORATION LTD    
Merely intimidating a kidnapped child to stop him from shouting for help did not prove the ingredient of threat resulting in a reasonable apprehension that such person may be hurt or killed as required for sustaining a conviction under Section 364A (kidnapping for ransom, etc.) of the Indian Penal Code, said the Supreme Court last week.  A division bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B.V. Nagarathna, while substituting the convictions under Section 364A of four men accused of kidnapping a school-going-boy for ransom, for a lesser offence of kidnapping simpliciter given under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the criminal code, held:   “The second ingredient of the charge under Section 364A, namely, threat resulting in giving rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The courts below did not thoroughly address this doubt before convicting the appellants. For proving the ingredient of threat, the intimidation of the child victim, for the purpose of making him silent, cannot be enough. If the sentence carrying a maximum sentence of death and a minimum sentence of life sentence has such a low evidentiary threshold, the difference between punishments for kidnapping under 363, 364 and 364A shall become meaningless.”   This set of appeals had arisen out of a kidnapping case, in which five accused (of whom one died during the pendency of appeal) were convicted under Sections 148 and 364A read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Before travelling in appeal to the top court, the appellate jurisdiction of the Punjab and Haryana High Court had been invoked. Upholding the impugned order, the High Court had held that all ingredients of Section 364A had been satisfied. The high court also rejected the appellant’s contention that there were material discrepancies in the prosecution’s case, affirming the veracity of the statement of the kidnapping victim, who was a fourteen-year-old boy at the time of the incident.   However, by comparing the victim’s statement to the police immediately after the incident, with that recorded by the trial court two years later, the apex court noted that the statement had been modified to reflect three differences, namely, a change in the exact timing of the threat, the specificity of the delivery of the threat to kill, and an omission of the intent behind the threat. These amended details were crucial for proving the second ingredient of a charge under Section 364A and bringing home the guilt under this provision. Therefore, the second ingredient, the court held, had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. On this ground, the Supreme Court took a different stand than the courts below it and set aside the conviction of the accused under Section 364A. In doing so, it placed heavy reliance on its decision in Sk. Ahmed v. State of Telangana, (2021) 9 SCC 59, in which the three stages or components of the said section were outlined as follows:   Kidnapping or abduction of a person and keeping them in detention,Threat to cause death or hurt, and the use of kidnapping, abduction, or detention with a demand to pay the ransom,When the demand is not met, then causing death.  According to the bench, the second ingredient was missing from the present case, which is why they held a conviction under Section 364A to be unsustainable. Thus, noting that it possessed a wide power to alter charges under Section 216 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 whilst not causing prejudice to the accused, the court allowed the appeals in part and substituted the convictions under Section 364A with that for an offence under Section 363. Justice Nagarathna wrote:   “The appellants are now convicted for the offence under Section 363, i.e., kidnapping and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and a fine of Rs. 2000/-. If the appellants have completed imprisonment of more than seven years with remission and have paid the fine of Rs. 2000/-, we direct the appellants to be released forthwith; if not on bail. If not, the appellants shall surrender within a period of four weeks and serve the remainder of the sentence.”  Case Title  Ravi Dhingra v.

The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by a candidate for setting aside a medical examination report which declared him unfit for the post of 'Constable Store Keeper' in the Border Security Force (BSF) in view of a tattoo depicting a heart and arrow with initials 'M' on his right forearm.  The petitioner had applied for the post in July and had cleared all the examinations. Thereafter, he was called for the 'Medical Examination' on November 17, where he was declared 'unfit' in view of the tattoo. Upon removal of the tattoo, he appeared for the 'Review Medical Examination' but was again declared unfit.  He prayed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus declaring him 'fit' in the 'Medical Examination' as he had already undergone the tattoo removal process. It was argued that being a resident of a rural village, it was customary and traditional to get a tattoo on the body. Since the tattoo was only 2 or 3 centimeters in size, he contended that his case should be reconsidered.  Justice A.S. Supehia, while rejecting the claim of the petitioner after referring to the advertisement for the post, said:  "The petitioner was already having tattoo, after he had undergone the recruitment process. As per the Review Examination Board, the tattoo was found on the right forearm of the petitioner depicting a heart and arrow with initials 'M' and he was declared unfit. The tattoo should have been removed prior to the recruitment process and the same must have faded substantially. Thus, the petitioner cannot claim appointment in the Disciplined Force, after removal of his tattoo, that too after undergoing the recruitment process." The Court referred to the norms published by the Ministry of Home Affairs (Directorate General Border Security Force) in the detailed advertisement, as per which in case of a candidate who has undergone removal process of tattoo "prior to appearing in the recruitment process," the same would be treated as a scar and not a tattoo, provided the same has faded substantially.  The Court noted that it was only in such cases that a candidate could be permitted to undergo the entire selection process with the approval of the Presiding Officer of the Recruitment Board.  The Court, accordingly, said that:   "Infirmity cannot be subsequently cured in order to dilute the provision of the advertisement. The candidate, as per the provision as mentioned hereinabove, prior to participation in the recruitment process should have undergone the process of removal of tattoo resulting into its fading substantially and only such removal of tattoo can be treated as a scar and not tattoo. The petitioner cannot claim appointment to the aforesaid post contrary to the conditions envisaged in the advertisement."  Case Title: Mahendra Chawla v. Union of India   Coram: Justice A.S.

The Gauhati High Court recently denied anticipatory bail to a person in connection with a case registered under Section 21(c) / 29 of NDPS Act, 1985 holding that recovery or seizure of the contraband is not mandatory for their arrest, detention or even their conviction.   Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi observed that this was so because the offences under the Act were part of an organised crime and any convincing and corroborating material in favour of the prosecution would be sufficient to establish their guilt. "This Court finds force in the submission of the learned APP, Assam that offences under the NDPS Act are part of an organized crime wherein different roles are played by different accused persons. Therefore, recovery or seizure cannot be held to be a sine qua non for the arrest/detention or even for conviction if there are other convincing and corroborating materials which in the present case are abundantly available."  It was also found that in a case involving the NDPS Act, various factors are to be taken into consideration like the quantity of the contraband, nature of the substance, nature of involvement etc. In the present case, the contraband is a commercial quantity and the substance is a chemically manufactured drug.  Moreover, Section 37 lays down that before granting bail, the relevant factors are that the Court should come to the satisfaction that prima facie the petitioner is not guilty of the offence and also the petitioner has to satisfy the Court that in case bail is granted, he is not likely to commit further offences. The aforesaid two factors did not seem to be fulfilled in the present case, and therefore the bail applications were dismissed.   The petitioner had filed an application under Section 438 CrPC seeking pre-arrest bail in connection with a case registered under Section 21(c) / 29 of the NDPS Act.   The case of the petitioner is that the allegations in the FIR are incorrect though it is a fact that a truck was intercepted and in the search, Eskuf cough syrup in 44,160 bottles in 276 cartons was recovered without any documents. The case of the petitioner is that the psychotropic substance seized was sold by the agency run by the petitioner to a distributor in the Karimganj district.  The further case of the petitioner is that one Anirudh Kumar Singh was running M/s. Hematech Pharmaceuticals at Narangi. The said Anirudh Kumar Singh had requested the present petitioner, who was running another drug distributorship in the name of ANM Pharmaceuticals to run his distributorship and accordingly executed a Power of Attorney dated 21.01.2021 in favour of the petitioner on the strength of which, the petitioner is running the business of M/s. Hematech Pharmaceuticals.  The Court by order dated 07 July, 2021 after going through the Case Diary had noticed that there was an issue as to whether the GST invoices are manufactured or genuine and accordingly, directed the Investigating Officer to file a report. However, in the meantime, an interim order was granted in favour of the petitioner.   Court recorded in the present order that on the last date of hearing the updated Case Diary was produced which contains the statements of Shri Arup Kanti Ghosh, the proprietor of M/s. Nalini Drugs Distributor along with the note of the IO, who had visited the location.   It was observed that the proprietor has specifically stated that no consignment of the present nature was ever made and all medicines for the Pharmacy are collected from local stockists and on no occasion any medicines were procured from beyond the Barrack Valley. The proprietor has also suspected some foul play regarding the license.  Petitioner argued that after the interim order dated 06.07.2021, the petitioner had appeared before the IO on 15.07.2021 and there is no instance of any misuse. With regard to the material submitted in the updated diary including the statement of Shri Arup Kanti Ghosh, the learned counsel has submitted that perhaps to avoid any complicacy, the proprietor has simply tried to wriggle out of the matter.  The Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for State submitted that from the very initiation of movement of the consignment involving a huge number of bottles in cartoons which admittedly is a psychotropic substance under the NDPS Act as the cough syrup contains a substance called Codeine, there are anomalies/illegalities at different stages including GST invoices and therefore, the present may not be a fit case to continue with the interim protection granted to the petitioner.  The thrust of arguments by the petitioner was on the fact that subsequent generation of bills can at best be a violation of the GST Act and cannot be a violation of the NDPS Act. Petitioners had also contended that though the articles are psychotropic substances it will come under the exception of Section 8(c) of the Act and transportation of the same with necessary documents is available under proviso to Rule 67(4) of the NDPS Rules.  The Court directed the IO of the case to make all efforts to investigate the case so that the persons involved in the heinous offence involved in the NDPS Act can be put to book, strictly in accordance with law. Considering the very object of the Act, namely to curb the menace of drugs and its ill effects on the society which has the propensity to destroy the generation as a whole, It was held that no case for grant of anticipatory bail was made out. The Court also clarified that the observation made are tentative in nature and shall not cause prejudice to either of the parties in the trial. In view of the above discussion, the bail application was rejected. Petitioner was represented by advocate A M Bora. Case Title: AMAL DAS v THE STATE OF ASSAM    
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently allowed the medical termination of a 30 week unwanted foetus, observing that while exercising the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, a Constitutional Court has got wider powers than what is prescribed under Section 3(2) of the MTP Act of 1971. The directions were passed by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea filed by a minor through her father seeking termination of pregnancy of minor.   After perusing the case diary the bench noted that on Feb 27th 2023, the father of the victim had lodged a report with the police alleging that his daughter, aged about 11 years has become pregnant because someone has committed rape upon her. On the basis of this report, FIR for offences under Sections 363, 376, 506 IPC and 4 of POCSO Act came to be registered and investigation was set into motion.  The bench further noted that the victim had been subjected to medical examination whereby medical opinion had revealed that the sexual contact been made and patient is currently 30 weeks pregnant with a single line intrauterine fetus. Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that the present case is a "sad and sordid" tale of a victim girl who has been made pregnant at the tender age of 11 years, adding that "She is studying only in the 4th class and is expecting a great future ahead of her,".   Explaining law applicable to the instant matter the court said that Rule 3B of the Medical Termination of pregnancy Rules 2003 clearly specify that survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest as also the minors are eligible for termination of pregnancy upto 24 weeks. In addition to this, Explanation-2 to Section 3 of the Act of 1971 provides that when pregnancy occurs because of rape, the anguish caused by such pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman, the bench underscored.   Referring to a cetena of Supreme court judgements on the issue, Justice Dhar observed that Constitutional Courts, on account of the fact that they are vested with wider powers, can permit termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks in appropriate and deserving cases. "Thus, while exercising the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, this Court has got wider powers than what is prescribed under Section 3(2) of the Act of 1971, which permits termination of pregnancy only when the length of pregnancy does not exceed a maximum period of 24 weeks", the bench maintained.  In view of the tender age of the victim, the bench said that if permission to terminate the pregnancy is not granted to the victim, who has expressed her desire to terminate the pregnancy, it will have serious consequences not only on her physical health but also upon mental health of the victim because she will have to live with the trauma and stigma of unwanted procreation throughout her life. This will not be in her interest and would also not be in the interests of the child that may be born. In these circumstances, if permission is not granted to the victim to terminate her pregnancy, she would be exposed to a miserable future," the court said adding that the father of the victim has also expressed his desire that the pregnancy of the victim needs to be terminated and he has also filed a petition for that. Justice Dhar further observed that whether termination of pregnancy of the victim at this stage would be medically feasible or whether it would involve any danger to her life, are the issues which have to be gone into by the experts in the relevant field, whereafter they have to take a decision as to whether or not the pregnancy of the victim should be terminated. "In case the Medical Board is of the opinion that termination of pregnancy of the minor victim can be undertaken without risk to her life, the Principal, GMC, Srinagar, shall ensure that termination of pregnancy of the minor victim is undertaken by competent doctors in accordance with the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act and rules framed thereunder and all other regulations and guidelines prescribed for the purpose," the court said. Allowing the plea, the court directed the Principal, Government Medical College (GMC) Srinagar, to immediately constitute a Medical Board of a Gynaecologist, Paediatrician, Radiologist or Sonologist, Psychiatrist and any other expert that may be deemed necessary by the Principal to medically examine the victim on March 21. The bench further directed that if the child is born alive despite the attempts of medical termination of pregnancy, the doctors shall ensure that all necessary care is given to the child. Directing the government to bear all necessary expenses for termination of pregnancy of the victim, the bench asked the Principal GMC to furnish a report before the Registrar Judicial of the Court within ten days, whereafter the Registrar Judicial shall list the matter before the Court on March, 31 to report compliance.

In a judgment pronounced on Wednesday, the Supreme Court directed all State Electricity Regulatory Commissions to frame regulations under 181 of the Electricity Act 2003 on the terms and conditions for determination of tariff within three months. The Court further directed that while framing these guidelines on the determination of tariff, the Commission shall follow the principles prescribed under Section 61 of the Electricity Act 2003, which also include the National Electricity policy and the National Tariff Policy. Where the State Commissions have already framed such regulations, they shall be amended to include provisions for criteria for choosing the modalities to determine the tariff, in case they are not included. A bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice AS Bopanna and Justice JB Pardiwala directed that the Commission should follow the objective of the Electricity Act to effectuate a sustainable model for electricity regulation in the State. The Regulatory Commission shall also take note of the specific needs of the State while framing these regulations. "Further, the regulations framed must be in consonance with the objectives of the Electricity Act 2003 which is to enhance the investment of private stakeholders in the electricity regulator sector so as to create a sustainable and effective system of tariff determination that is cost-efficient so that benefits percolate to the end consumer", the Court observed. The bench was pronouncing its judgment in the case The Tata Power Transmission Company Ltd vs Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. Commission cannot negate tariff determined through bidding process - Other directions The Court noted that the Electricity Act 2003 gives sufficient flexibility to regulate the intra-state transmission system and the State Commissions possess the power to determine and regulate tariff. The Electricity Act does not provide one dominant method to determine tariff.  Section 63 provides for determination of tariff through bidding process. If the tariff has already been determined through tariff, then the Commission has to adopt such tariff. The Commission cannot negate such tariff determined through bidding using its powers under Section 62. The Commission can choose not to adopt the tariff determined through the bidding process only if the bidding process was not transparent or if the procedural guidelines were not followed. Section 62 and 63 prescribe the modalities of tariff determination. The non-obstante clause under Section 63 cannot be interpreted to mean that Section 63 will take precedence over Section 62 at the stage of choosing the modalities of determining the tariff. The criteria for the modalities of tariff determination ought to be notified by the state commissions either through regulations under Section 181 or guidelines under Section 61. Ad-hoc functioning of state utilities due to lacunae in regulations The Court noted that in this case, the MERC has neither framed regulations nor notified guidelines prescribing the criteria for choosing the modalities for determination of tariff.  The issue in this case related to the allotment of the High Voltage Direct Transmission (HVDC) project. The Court noted that the Electricity Act, the National Tariff Policy and the Maharashtra GOM decision dated 04.02.2019 did not make it binding on the MERC to allot the HVDC project only through the tariff based competitive bidding route. Therefore, the Court held that the MERC decision to allot the HVDC project was within a reasonable exercise of its power and dismissed the appeal by Tata Power Transmission Company. At the same time, the Court observed that the case has brought to its notice the "ad-hoc nature of the functioning of the state transmission utility". "Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (MSETCL) has been changing its stand on HVDC technology without following any due procedure. The flips-flops by MSETCL have led to a waste, loss of time and investment, while the demand in the electricity sector has been increasing exponentially". The Court opined that the "ad-hoc functioning of the transmission utilities is attributable to the lacunae in the regulations guiding the exercise of their functions". In this backdrop, the Court issued the directions to the State Commissions. Case details TATA Power Company Limited Transmission vs Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission |  (SC) 987 | CA | 23 Nov 2022 | CJI DY Chandrachud, Justices AS Bopanna and JB Pardiwala Headnotes Electricity Act, 2003 - The Appropriate State Commissions possess the power to determine and regulate tariff. The Electricity Act 2003 seeks to distance the State Governments from the determination and regulation of tariff, placing such power completely within the ambit of the Appropriate Commissions - States have sufficient flexibility to regulate the intra-state transmission systems. (Para 128) Electricity Act, 2003 ; Section 181 - State Regulatory Commissions to frame Regulations under Section 181 of the Act on the terms and conditions for determination of tariff within three months from the date of this judgment. While framing these guidelines on determination of tariff, the Appropriate Commission shall be guided by the principles prescribed in Section 61, which also includes the NEP and NTP. Where the Appropriate Commission(s) has already framed regulations, they shall be amended to include provisions on the criteria for choosing the modalities to determine the tariff, in case they have not been already included. The Commissions while being guided by the principles contained in Section 61 shall effectuate a balance that would create a sustainable model of electricity regulation in the States. The Regulatory Commission shall curate to the specific needs of the State while framing these regulations. (Para 131) Electricity Act, 2003 ; Sections 61-63 - Electricity Act do not prescribe one dominant method to determine tariff. Section 63 operates after the bidding process has been conducted. Where the tariff has already been determined through bidding, the Appropriate Commission has to adopt such tariff that has been determined. The Appropriate Commission cannot negate such tariff determined through bidding by using its powers under Section 62. The tariff determined through the bidding process may not be adopted by the Appropriate Commission only if the bidding process was not transparent (undertaking a substantive review) or the procedure prescribed by the Central Government guidelines under Section 63 was not followed (undertaking a procedural review)- Sections 62 and 63 stipulate the modalities of tariff determination. The non-obstante clause in Section 63 cannot be interpreted to mean that Section 63 would take precedence over Section 62 at the stage of choosing the modality to determine tariff. The criteria or guidelines for the determination of the modality of tariff determination ought to be notified by the Appropriate State Commission either through regulations under Section 181 of the Act or guidelines under Section 61 of the Act. (Para 128) Electricity Act, 2003 ; Section 125 - Findings of fact by the Regulatory Commission and the Tribunal cannot be reopened on appeal under Section 125 - Appeal shall lie only if the court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. (Para 106.2) Electricity Act, 2003 ; Section 86(1)(a) - MERC while exercising its general regulatory powers under Section 86(1)(a) shall be guided by the NTP 2016, which shall be a material consideration. Accordingly, while NTP 2016 requires intra-state transmission projects above the threshold limit to be allotted through TBCB route, this constitutes a material consideration to be taken into account. (Para 128)      
In a judgment pronounced last week, the Supreme Court observed that protection of sanction under Section 197 of Code of Criminal Procedure is not available to public servants prosecuted under Section 48 the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.The bench comprising Justices Uday Umesh Lalit and Ajay Rastogi, referring to previous judgments in V.C. Chinnappa Goudar v. Karnataka... In a judgment pronounced last week, the Supreme Court observed that protection of sanction under Section 197 of Code of Criminal Procedure is not available to public servants prosecuted under Section 48 the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The bench comprising Justices Uday Umesh Lalit and Ajay Rastogi, referring to previous judgments in V.C. Chinnappa Goudar v. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board vs. B. Heera Naik observed: If the violation of the provisions of the Water Act was at the hands of a Department, subject to the satisfaction of the requirements under Section 48 of the Water Act, "the Head of the Department" would be deemed to be guilty. This would of course be subject to the defences which are available to him to establish whether the offence in question was committed without his knowledge or that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence. Because of deeming fiction under Section 48 of the Water Act, the protection under Section 197 of the Code would not be available and the matter ought to be considered de hors such protection. If the concerned public servant happens to be a Chief Officer or Commissioner of a Municipal Council or Town Panchayat, he cannot strictly be called "the Head of the Department of the Government". Therefore, the matter would not come under Section 48 of the Water Act. But the matter would come directly under Section 47 of the Water Act. Even in such cases, the deeming fiction available under Section 47 of the Water Act would dis-entitle the public servant from the protection under Section 197 of the Code.  If the offenders are other than public servants or where the principal offenders are corporate entities in private sectors, the question of protection under Section 197 would not arise. In this case, Sandur Gram Panchayat, Sandur, District Bellary, Karnataka and the Chief Officer of said Gram Panchayat, were accused of having committed offences  punishable under Sections 43 and 44 of the Water Act. The Judicial Magistrate found the officer guilty of these offences and convicted him. Sessions Judge, allowing the appeal, held that he was entitled to the protection under Section 197 CrPC and in the absence of requisite sanction, his prosecution was invalid. The High Court, while allowing the appeal filed by Karnataka State Pollution Control Board  observed that the protection under Section 197 of the Code would not be available. Since the matter was not considered by the lower Appellate Court on merits, the High Court remitted the matter back it for fresh consideration on merits. In appeal filed by the accused, the bench noted that the High Court has referred to the decision in V.C. Chinnappa Goudar case, in which it was found that "the Head of the Department" by virtue of deeming provision would be deemed to be guilty and, as such, the protection under Section 197 of the Code would stand excluded. Also referring to B. Heera Naik, case, the bench upheld the High Court judgment and observed: 12. If we consider the present matter in the light of these postulates, the case stands completely covered by the decision of this Court in B. Heera Naik (Supra). 13. The High Court was, therefore, right and justified in setting-aside the decision of the lower Appellate Court, which was purely based on the issue of the applicability of Section 197 of the Code. In the circumstances, the High Court rightly remitted the matter to the lower Appellate Court to be considered afresh on merits.   Read Judgment        
The Kerala High Court has ruled that a marriage between Muslims under personal law is not excluded from the sweep of the POCSO Act. Justice Bechu Kurain Thomas said if one of the parties to the marriage is a minor, irrespective of the validity or otherwise of the marriage, offences under the POCSO Act will apply. The court disagreed with the view taken by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Javed v. State of Haryana ( (PH) 276); by Delhi High Court in Fija and Another v. State Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Others ( (Del) 793) and by Karnataka High Court in Mohammad Waseem Ahamad v. State ( (Kar) 436). "With respect to the learned Judges, I am unable to agree to the proposition laid down in those decisions that an offence under the POCSO Act will not get attracted against a Muslim marrying a minor," Justice Thomas said.  Muslim Marriages Not Excluded From POCSO Act, Physical Relationship With Minor An Offence Irrespective Of Validity Of Marriage: Kerala High Courthttps://t.co/o3s4BQLVpS pic.twitter.com/6m6uyf80VB— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) November 20, 2022  The court made the observations in its order on the bail application moved by a 31-year-old Muslim man who is accused of kidnapping and raping a minor. His claim was that he had validly married the girl in March 2021 under the personal laws applicable to them. The accused was earlier booked under sections 366, 376(2) (m) and 376(3) of the Indian Penal Code and under sections 5(j)((ii), 5(i) and section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 by Thiruvalla Police Station.  The allegation against him is that he had abducted the minor, who is a native of West Bengal and "committed repeated penetrative sexual assaults during the period before 31.08.2022, due to which the victim became pregnant and thereby, the accused committed the offences alleged." The FIR was registered on the intimation received from a doctor of a health centre where the victim had gone for a checkup on her pregnancy. The counsel representing the accused in bail proceedings argued that since Mohammedan law permits marriage of girls below 18 years and such marriages being legally valid, he cannot even be prosecuted for the offence of rape or those under the POCSO Act. The State argued that POCSO Act will prevail over the Mohammedan law. Justice Thomas said that the The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, statutorily recognizes that in all questions relating to marriage, the rule of decision shall be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat). "However, after the coming into force of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, it is questionable whether the said personal law will prevail over the special statute relating to marriages. Under section 3 of the said Act, a child marriage shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party, who is a child. But section 12 makes a child marriage void in certain circumstances," said the bench. The court said the investigating officer in the case has alleged that the victim was enticed by the accused without the knowledge of her parents and the age of the victim being only just above 14 years at the time of the alleged marriage, the existence of a valid marriage, even according to Muslim Personal Law, is debatable.  "However, the petitioner is arrested for the offences under the POCSO Act as well as the IPC. The POCSO Act is a special statute enacted specifically for the protection of children from sexual offences. Sexual exploitation of every nature against a child is treated as an offence. Marriage is not excluded from the sweep of the statute," ruled the court. It further said it is trite law that when the provisions of a statute are repugnant to, or contrary to the customary law or personal law, in the absence of any specific exclusion of the said customary or personal law from the statutory provisions, the statute will prevail, and the personal law or the customary law shall stand abrogated to the extent of the inconsistency. "On an appreciation of the above principles, it can prima facie be held, for the purpose of this bail application, that the very marriage allegedly entered into between the petitioner and the victim cannot be relied upon as a legally valid marriage," said the court. Remarking on the characteristics of the POCSO Act, the Court said: "POCSO Act is a special enactment. The advances and progress achieved in societal thinking have resulted in the enactment. This special statute was enacted based on principles arising out of jurisprudence relating to child abuse. The child abuse jurisprudence evolved out of the need to protect the vulnerable, the gullible and the innocent child. The legislative intent to protect the child from sexual predators hovering over them under different labels, including that of marriage, is explicitly evident from the statutory provisions. Child marriages have been regarded as a human right violation. A child marriage compromises the growth of the child to her full potential. It is the bane of society. The legislative intent reflected through the POCSO Act is to prohibit physical relationships with a child, even under the cover of marriage. This is the intent of society, too, for a statute is, as is often said, the expression or reflection of the will of the people".  The Court also said that Section 42A of the POCSO Act categorically stipulates that in the event of any inconsistency with provisions of any other law, the POCSO Act would prevail.  "Personal Laws and customary laws are both laws. Section 42A intends to override such laws also. Therefore it cannot be gainsaid that after the coming into force of the POCSO Act, penetrative sexual intercourse with a child, even if it is under the guise of marriage, is an offence" The Court refused to accept the argument that the victim had the intellectual ability to give consent and was under no compulsion or any sexual exploitation to attract the POSCO Act. "In this context, it is appropriate to mention the decision in Sri. Aleem Pasha v. The State of Karnataka (Crl. R.P No. 7295/2022). In the said judgment, the Karnataka High Court granted bail to an accused who had married a 17-year-old Muslim girl and was booked for the offences under the POCSO Act. A reading of the above judgment reveals that the learned Single Judge had observed that the POCSO Act will prevail over the personal law. However, on the facts of the said case, the court felt it appropriate to grant bail, especially considering the age of the victim, which was more than 17 years."  Dismissing the bail plea of the accused, the court said the victim was brought to Kerala from West Bengal and that too allegedly behind the back of her parents. "This Court cannot be oblivious to the above circumstances. The investigation is also stated to be still continuing. Reckoning the aforesaid circumstances, I am of the view that this is not a fit case where the petitioner can be released on bail at this juncture," it said. Case Title: Khaledur Rahman v. State of Kerala & Anr.      
If the Investigating Officer does not believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons he/she is not required to be produced in custody.The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. that it does not impose an obligation on the Officer-in-charge to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing of the charge sheet.The court observed that the practice of some Trial Courts of insisting on the arrest of an accused as a pre-requisite formality to take the charge-sheet on record is misplaced and contrary... The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. that it does not impose an obligation on the Officer-in-charge to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing of the charge sheet. The court observed that the practice of some Trial Courts of insisting on the arrest of an accused as a pre-requisite formality to take the charge-sheet on record is misplaced and contrary to the very intent of Section 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In the appeal before the Supreme Court against dismissal of an anticipatory bail application, the court noted that the trial court had taken a view that unless the person is taken into custody the chargesheet will not be taken on record in view of Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that some Delhi High Court judgments (Court on its own motion v. Central Bureau of Investigation) have held that it is not essential in every case involving a cognizable and non-bailable offence that an accused be taken into custody when the charge sheet/final report is filed. "The Delhi High Court is not alone in having adopted this view and other High Courts apparently have also followed suit on the proposition that criminal courts cannot refuse to accept a chargesheet simply because the accused has not been arrested and produced before the court. ", the court observed while referring to the observations made by the Gujarat High Court in Deendayal Kishanchand & Ors. v. State of Gujarat. The court observed that the word "custody" appearing in Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the charge sheet. The court said. We are in agreement with the aforesaid view of the High Courts and would like to give our imprimatur to the said judicial view. It has rightly been observed on consideration of Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. that it does not impose an obligation on the Officer-in-charge to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing of the chargesheet. We have, in fact, come across cases where the accused has cooperated with the investigation throughout and yet on the chargesheet being filed non-bailable warrants have been issued for his production premised on the requirement that there is an obligation to arrest the accused and produce him before the court. We are of the view that if the Investigating Officer does not believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons he/she is not required to be produced in custody. The word "custody" appearing in Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the chargesheet. The court added that personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional mandate. It observed: "The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made. A distinction must be made between the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for exercise of it.4 If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. If the Investigating Officer has no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation we fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the officer to arrest the accused." We are, in fact, faced with a situation where contrary to the observations in Joginder Kumar's case how a police officer has to deal with a scenario of arrest, the trial courts are stated to be insisting on the arrest of an accused as a pre-requisite formality to take the chargesheet on record in view of the provisions of Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. We consider such a course misplaced and contrary to the very intent of Section 170 of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that, in the present case, the accused had joined the investigation, investigation has completed and he has been roped in after seven years of registration of the FIR. We can think of no reason why at this stage he must be arrested before the charge sheet is taken on record, the court said while allowing the appeal.      
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Tuesday called out the "Quick Fixes" resorted to by the police during criminal investigations, holding that investigations must be conducted within the domain of "Facts in Issue" and "Relevant Facts". A single bench comprising Justices Rahul Bharti observed, "Police Investigation acts with relish to exhibit its harassment bearing power of investigation aiming more to quick fix the facts into its view point of accusation but faintly knows the province of investigation out of which the full facts are to be drawn out to prove the script of the crime in all its details...If a given Police Investigation has least bothered to follow the script of said two domains, then in the name of Police Investigation what is taking place would be nothing but paper collection and compilation venture by the Investigation Officer so as to claim the service credit of having prepared and submitted a police report/challan in a court of law unmindful of its soundness and sustainability in a court of law." The Court was dealing with a quashing petition filed by one Ajay Partap booked under Sections 366 and 506 IPC for abduction and criminal intimidation. As per the complainant, the accused forced her into a vehicle and forcefully took her signature on a Marriage Agreement under coercion and threats. The complaint specifically mentioned that no 'physical contact' was made. The petitioner (accused) contended that the marital ties were forged on the free will of both the parties and they even got a marriage agreement executed and duly notarized accompanied with solemnization of marriage taking place in Arya Samaj Mandir.  On perusal of the challan, the court noted that offences under Section 376 (rape) IPC had been added against the petitioner, as if presenting a woman as being a victim of rape is a "matter of ritual and routine" for the Police. It said that the perusal of the contents of the complaint by no stretch of reading and reference hints at any act of omission or commission against the petitioner amounting or attempting outraging the modesty of the complainant, lest that of subjecting her to an offence of rape.  "Now, in case the investigation was to attend to offence of rape under section 376 IPC as per the said 164 Cr.P.C statement, it was expected of the Investigation Officer to have carried forward his investigation to each and every aspect of the accusation related to said offence. Nothing of that sort was ever examined and done by the Investigating Officer", the bench added.  Bringing to fore the callous approach of the Investigation officer in the matter the bench observed,  "Thus, without any addition of facts being brought on record on the basis of an investigation with respect to the alleged event of so-called commission of rape of the respondent 2, the Investigating Officer concerned did the paper work in the name of the investigation for the purpose of booking the petitioner for the commission of offence of rape as well" said the court.  Deliberating further on the matter Justice Bharti observed that the act of translation of complaint from section 366 IPC to a case of rape under Section 376 is nothing but a "flight of fancy" on the part of the Investigating Officer of the case, in which the Investigating Officer concerned was least sensitive even to the very social and personal reputation of the complainant.  In its concluding remarks the bench observed that in the name of the investigation in the present case, only an empty formality has been carried out by the Investigation Officer/s leaving the truth of the case a casualty. Hence it quashed the FIR. Case Title : Ajay Pratap Vs UT of J&K and Ors.

The Rajasthan High Court has directed the state government to take steps to treat the transgender community as socially and educationally backward class of citizens and extend all kinds of reservations in cases of admission in educational institutions and for public appointments.The division bench of Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Justice Madan Gopal Vyas has granted four... The Rajasthan High Court has directed the state government to take steps to treat the transgender community as socially and educationally backward class of citizens and extend all kinds of reservations in cases of admission in educational institutions and for public appointments. The division bench of Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Justice Madan Gopal Vyas has granted four months' time to complete this exercise. The development ensued in a writ petition filed by one Ganga Kumari, seeking effective reservation to the transgenders in terms of the mandate of the Supreme Court in the case of National Legal Services Authority Vs. Union of India & Ors. The State had opposed the plea, claiming that it is a matter of prerogative of the State as to the manner and the extent to which reservations have to be provided; and the petitioner cannot seek that the reservations in a particular manner or to the extent should be provided to her. Disagreeing, the Court observed that given the directions issued by the Supreme Court in NALSA judgment, the State is left with no option but to implement the directives  "It has been categorically directed to the Central Government as well as State Government to take steps to treat transgenders as socially and educationally backward classes of citizens and extend all kinds of reservations in cases of admission in educational institutions and for public appointments. Such a direction clearly casts an obligation on the part of the State to work out reservation in such manner and to such extent as it may decide on the basis of relevant data available," the Bench observed. It added that much time has lapsed since the directions were issued by the Supreme Court and the State should have come out with proper rules, regulations and legislations to provide special treatment to the community, by now.  It stated that considering the nature of exercise required to be undertaken, the State is required to complete the exercise expeditiously, maximum within a period of four months.  The court allowed the petitioner to participate in the process of selection and ruled that her candidature shall not be rejected only on the ground that the petitioner is third gender.

Calling the notice issued by the Uttar Pradesh Police to the Managing Director of Twitter India as a "tool of harassment", the Karnataka High Court on Friday quashed the said notice, issued under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in relation to the FIR registered over the videos posted in Twitter showing the assault of a Muslim man in Ghaziabad. The High Court said that the UP Police issued the coercive notice without ascertaining if Manish Maheshwari, the MD of Twitter Communications India Private Ltd (TCIPL), had any control over the contents posted in Twitter. "The provisions of the statute cannot be permitted to become tools of harassment. The respondent has not placed even an iota of material which would prima facie show involvement of the petitioner. In that view of the matter petitioner has made out a case. Section 41A notice is issued by malafide and the petition is maintainable. The Annexure A1 notice is quashed", the order passed by Justice G Narender said. The bench said that the Section 41A Notice- which contains a threat of arrest- must be read as a notice under Section 160 CrPC, which is issued for seeking statements from a witness. The Police is at liberty to seek the statement of Mahehswari as a witness through virtual mode, the bench clarified. "The invocation of Section 41A was resorted to as an arm-twisting method after Maheshwari did not respond to initial notice under Section 160 CrPC", the High Court made a harsh observation against the UP Police. The HC observed that the records indicated that Twitter Communications India Private Ltd (TCIPL) was involved in market research and advertising, with no control over social media content. Twitter INC, the USA company which manages the microblogging platform, holds no share in TCIPL. "Material placed on record demonstrates that the entity Twitter India is an independent entity and share holding patter and control of the affairs of the company is in hands of Twitter Ireland...The information available cannot be said to be indicating that petitioner controlling the contents of the social media platforms run by Twitter Inc", the High Court noted. The Court also noted that Maheshwari has not be arraigned as an accused in the Ghaziabad FIR.  In this backdrop, the High Court concluded that the Section 41A notice was "mala fide", "arm twisting method" and "tool of harassment". The Court also rejected the objection raised by UP Police against the maintainability of the petition alleging lack of territorial jurisdiction. The Twitter employee was asked by the UP Police to appear before Loni Border Police Station in relation to the investigation on the Ghaziabad video issue. The notice under section 41A was issued following a notice issued to him on June 17, under section 160 of CrPC, calling upon him to appear before police to record statement as a witness in the case. The Court noted that he is not named as an accused person either in the complaint or the FIR. It also noted that the Police was conscious that it is Twitter who can or who could have controlled the impugned video/ tweets on the platform. "What emerges is that petitioner is not arrayed as an accused. Nor is it the case of respondent that there is credible information received by them in regards to his involvement or that respondent entertain a suspicion based on reasonable grounds that he committed an offence. In the absence of these three conditions the respondent could not have invoked section 41A at all. If the law mandated that act be performed in particular manner or if law mandated that a right gets vested only in a particular circumstance, it is needless to say that act can be performed only in that manner. In the absence of pre-conditions being met the authority necessarily was divested of power to invoke the statutory power."  On June 24, the Court had restrained the Uttar Pradesh police from taking coercive action against Manish Maheshwari, pursuant to the notice issued to him under Section 41A CrPC in the Ghaziabad FIR. The interim order passed by the High Court came to be challenged by the Police before the Supreme Court.  Senior Advocate C V Nagesh appearing for the petitioner had argued that Section 41A notice is a fallout to the Section 160 CrPC notice which lacks sanction of law. He stated that since Maheshwari is not a resident of UP, a police officer has to come to Bengaluru to investigate the matter under section 160 CrPC. He further claimed that Maheshwari has never been or is not member of the Board of Directors of the company and thus, Twitter is not controlled or administered by him. It was further his claim that Twitter Inc is an independent organization and it is totally different, while Twitter India is a different entity. Advocate Prasanna Kumar appearing for the Uttar Pradesh police had raised the issue maintainability citing lack of territorial jurisdiction. Mere service of notice at a place will not confer jurisdiction there for the purposes of Article 226(2) of the Constitution, he had argued. He also made it clear that 41A notice was issued to the Petitioner only in a representative capacity and their aim is to merely identify Twitter India head, for which they seek the Petitioner's cooperation. The court was also addressed on the issue of territorial jurisdiction, inasmuch as the alleged incident is said to have taken place in Uttar Pradesh, thus the petitioner will have to approach the court in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The FIR was registered over the tweets made by few journalists and politicians about the incident of an elderly Muslim man getting assaulted near Ghaziabad. It was alleged in the FIR that fake news was shared on Twitter that the attack was communal in nature. It was also stated before the Court that despite clarification issued by Ghaziabad police, neither doctored video nor tweets were deleted by Twitter authorities, thus resulting into further tension. The FIR was in the backdrop of an elderly Muslim man's claim in a video that his beard was cut off, and he was forced to chant "Vande Mataram" and "Jai Shri Ram". However, later on, the Uttar Pradesh Police ruled out any "communal angle" and said that Sufi Abdul Samad, the elderly man, was attacked by six men, as they were unhappy over the tabeez (amulets) he had sold them. It mentioned offences punishable under Sections 153 (provoking to cause riots), 153A (promoting enmity between religious groups), 295A (insulting religious beliefs), 505 (statements inducing public mischief) & 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.      
The Allahabad High Court recently observed that a period of 1.5 years is an 'extremely unreasonable long time' to keep disciplinary proceedings pending against an employee after the submission of an inquiry report. The bench of Justice Alok Mathur observed so while dealing with the case of one Yatendra Kumar (suspended General Manager, U.P. Nirman Nigam Ltd), challenging his suspension order passed by the UP Government in June 2020 in contemplation of departmental proceedings initiated against him. It was his grievance that neither a show cause notice has been given to him, nor disciplinary proceedings been concluded despite the fact that an inquiry report has already been submitted to the Disciplinary Authority in March 2021. It was his submission before the Court that as petitioner would be superannuated on 31st December 2022 and likely to retire during his suspension, therefore, pendency of the disciplinary proceedings would adversely affect his post-retiral dues and other service benefits admissible to him. Taking note of the facts of the case and the arguments advanced, the Court opined that if the inquiry report was submitted in March, 2021, there was no reason as to why disciplinary proceedings have not been concluded within a reasonable time, thereafter.  Further, when the Court was informed by the State's counsel that two weeks time is required for passing final orders in the matter, the Court though it appropriate to dispose of the plea wwith direction to the competent authority to conclude the inquiry proceedings within maximum period of three weeks.  Significantly, the Court further observed that in case disciplinary proceedings are not concluded within the time prescribed above, the impugned order of suspension dated June 1, 2020 would cease to exist. Senior Advocate S.C. Misra assisted by Advocate Shivanshu Goswami appeared for the petitioner. Case title - Yatendra Kumar v. State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief Secy./Prin. Secy. Public Works Deptt.

The Supreme Court held that a Civil Court has jurisdiction to try a suit filed by a borrower against a Bank or Financial Institution. Answering the reference made to to it, the three judges bench presided by Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul observed that an independent suit filed by the borrower against the bank or financial institution cannot be transferred to be tried along with application under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993.   "It is a matter of option of the defendant in the claim under the RDB Act. However, the proceedings under the RDB Act will not be impeded in any manner by filing of a separate suit before the Civil Court", the bench also comprising of Justices Abhay S. Oka and Vikram Nath clarified. The bench therefore approved the judgments in Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. v. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (2009) 8 SCC 646 and Indian Bank v. ABS Marine Products (P) Ltd (2006) 5 SCC 72 except to the extent that they allow the transfer of a suit from the Civil Court to the DRT. The judgments in United Bank of India, Calcutta v. Abhijit Tea Co. Pvt. Ltd. (2000) 7 SCC 357 and State Bank of India vs. Ranjan Chemicals Ltd. (2007) 1 SCC 97 have been overruled.  The Reference In this case, the Bank of Rajasthan filed an application for recovery of the amounts due from VCK Shares & Stock Broking Services Ltd. (borrower) before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Kolkata. The borrower entered appearance to defend the proceedings before DRT but also filed a civil suit before the Calcutta High Court and claimed a decree for sale of the pledged shares, recovery of sale proceeds, and an inquiry into the losses suffered by it along with a decree for payment of money. The Division Bench of Calcutta High Court relying on the judgment in Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. (supra), held that a suit filed by a borrower against the bank was not barred before the Civil Court, although a suit filed by the bank against the borrower was barred. While considering the appeal filed by the Bank against this order, the two judges bench of the Apex Court noticed the conflicting views expressed in the above mentioned judgment. Thus it referred the following issues to larger bench:  (a) Whether an independent suit filed by a borrower against a Bank or Financial Institution, which has applied for recovery of its loan against the plaintiff under the RDB Act, is liable to be transferred and tried along with the application under the RDB Act by the DRT ?  (b) If the answer is in the affirmative, can such transfer be ordered by a court only with the consent of the plaintiff?  (c) Is the jurisdiction of a Civil Court to try a suit filed by a borrower against a Bank or Financial Institution ousted by virtue of the scheme of the RDB Act in relation to the proceedings for recovery of debt by a Bank or Financial Institution?  Civil Court Jurisdiction Not Ousted By RDB Act The bench referred to the statutory scheme of RDB Act and noted the following A summary remedy is provided in respect of claims of banks and financial institutions so that recovery of the same may not be impeded by the elaborate procedure of the Code. The defendant has a right to defend the claim and file a counterclaim in view of sub-Sections (6) and (8) of Section 19 of the RDB Act. In case of pending proceedings to be transferred to the DRT, Section 31 of the RDB Act took care of the issue of mere transfer of the Bank's claim, albeit without transfer of the counterclaim. Thus, if the debtor desires to institute a counterclaim, that can be filed before the DRT and will be tried along with the case. However, it is subject to a caveat that the bank may move for segregation of that counterclaim to be relegated to a proceeding before a Civil Court under Section 19(11) of the RDB Act, though such determination is to take place along with the determination of the claim for recovery of debt Having noted this, the bench said: "We are thus of the view that there is no provision in the RDB Act by which the remedy of a civil suit by a defendant in a claim by the bank is ousted, but it is the matter of choice of that defendant. Such a defendant may file a counterclaim, or may be desirous of availing of the more strenuous procedure established under the Code, and that is a choice which he takes with the consequences thereof." Civil Court has no power to transfer a suit to the DRT On the issue of the power of the Civil Court to transfer an independent proceeding instituted by a defendant(borrower) to be tried alongside a recovery proceeding before the DRT, the court said: "There is gainsay that there is no specific power to transfer a suit to the DRT. A plaint can be returned only under the provisions of Order VII Rule 10 of the Code for the reasons specified therein. In the absence of such reasons, Section 151 of the Code cannot be utilised as a residuary power to achieve the transfer, which is really a consequence of return of the plaint when the grounds under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code are not satisfied. The absence of any legislative power cannot give a power by implication to the Civil Court. We believe that it would not be appropriate to read such power to transfer a suit to a DRT under Section 151 of the Code when the DRT is a creature of a statute and that statute does not provide for such eventuality." Claim before the DRT under the RDB Act not to be impeded by filing a civil suit. The court further observed that the process envisaged under the RDB Act be impeded in any manner by filing of a separate suit if a defendant chooses to do so.  "A claim petition before the DRT has to proceed in a particular manner and would so proceed. There can be no question of stay of those proceedings by way of a civil proceeding instituted by a defendant before the Civil Court. The suit would take its own course while a petition before the DRT would take its own course. We appreciate that this may be in the nature of parallel proceedings but then it is the defendant's own option. We see no problem with the same as long as the objective of having expeditious disposal of the claim before the DRT under the RDB Act is not impeded by filing a civil suit. Thus, it is not open to a defendant, who may have taken recourse to the Civil Court, to seek a stay on the decision of the DRT awaiting the verdict of his suit before the Civil Court as it is a matter of his choice" Case details Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. vs VCK Shares & Stock Broking Services Ltd. |  (SC) 941 | CA 8972-8973 OF 2014 | 10 Nov 2022 | Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Abhay S.

The Delhi High Court has observed that extraordinary powers of High Court under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure are not meant to be exercised at the disposal of the affluent accused who do not leave any stone unturned to arm-twist the law of the land and administrative machinery to achieve their scrupulous ends. Justice Chandra Dhari Singh dismissed a plea filed by Religare Finvest's ex Promoter, Malvinder Mohan Singh in connection with Religare Finvest scam case, challenging the order dated 7th December 2021 passed by the Trial Court which had dismissed his request to consult physically with his lawyers outside jail premises, while in custody, in order to prepare for proceedings before the Supreme Court, High Court and various district courts.  The plea also sought directions to the Jail Superintendent to facilitate physical meetings with the Advocate while in custody at the Delhi High Court Mediation Centre. Mohan had also challenged the Impugned Order and any proceedings emanating therefrom, for failing to secure the his right to an adequate representation, under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, read with Delhi Prison Rules, 2018. The Court was of the view that the use of extraordinary power under sec. 482 of CrPC is required to be reserved only for extraordinary cases, where the judicial discretion and indulgence is warranted as per the facts of the case. Thus, the Court noted that the accused along with others was alleged to have been swindled the proceeds of crime by the ED to the tune of 2397 Crores. In this backdrop, the Court added: "Economic offences are detrimental not only to the economy of the nation but also the society at large. The underprivileged and downtrodden are often at the receiving end of the after-effects of such offences. Extraordinary powers of this Court are not meant to be exercised at the disposal of the affluent accused who do not leave any stone unturned to arm-twist the law of the land and administrative machinery to achieve their scrupulous ends." The Court opined that the extraordinary writ jurisdiction cannot be exercised to give special treatment to Mohan by facilitating physical meetings for him with his counsel.  "Inherent powers of the Court are meant to be exercised to prevent the abuse of the process of any Court, however the petitioner under the garb of the liberty to approach the Court under the said provision is attempting to commit gross misuse of process," it added.  The Court said that sec. 482 CrPC is meant to secure the ends of justice cannot be otherwise subverted to circumvent the scheme of the Code.  "In light of the aforesaid, this Court does not find any cogent reason or any substantial ground to invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction to grant the relief that is being sought by the petitioner," the Court concluded.  Accordingly, the plea was dismissed.  FIR No. 50/19 was registered by Economic Offence Wing of Delhi Police on the complaint of Manpreet Singh Suri, Authorised Representative of Religare Finvest Limited under sec. 409, 420 and 120B of IPC. According to the said FIR, the accused persons were alleged to have an absolute control in Religare Enterprises Ltd. and it's subsidiaries who allegedly put RFL in "poor financial condition" by advancing loan to companies having no financial standing and control by the said accused persons. According to the FIR, the accused persons in connivance with each other swindled public money to the tune of Rs.2397 crores. Furthermore, it was alleged that such entities wilfully defaulted in repaying the loans and thereafter caused wrongful loss of about Rs. 2397 Crores to RFL. The FIR also states that the said discrepancies were noted by the Reserve Bank of India. Malvinder Mohan Singh was arrested on 11.10.2019 in the present FIR. First charge sheet was filed on 06.01.2020 and cognizance of the offence was taken on 15.01.2020 by the Court. Thereafter, supplementary chargesheet was also filed in the matter.

The Allahabad High Court last week granted bail to a man booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act) from whose possession allegedly over 1 Quintal of Ganja was recovered. The Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal granted bail to one Om Prakash Verma who claimed before the Court that the procedure laid down in the Standing Order to be followed while conducting seizure of the contraband was not followed in the instant case. Essentially, Verma, along with another person was arrested with 1 quintal 3 Kg 290 grams of ganja, and 38 packets of cigarette rolling paper and thereafter booked under Sections 8/20 of The Narcotic Drugs And Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The counsel for the applicant argued that the said contraband was allegedly recovered from 19 packets and one polythene amounting to a total of 1 quintal 3 Kg and 290 grams, however, only one sample had been taken from the said contraband which was is a clear violation of Clause 2.4 of the Standing Order No.1 of 1989. It was submitted that the police was required to draw a sample from each packet allegedly recovered with the help of a field testing kit, however, in the instant case, it was argued, the sample from only one packet was taken and therefore, it cannot be ascertained whether all the 19 packets and one polythene bag (total 20 in all) contained the alleged contraband of ganja or not. It may be noted that the Central Government has issued Standing Order No. 1 of 1989 which prescribes the procedure to be followed while conducting seizure of the contraband. The counsel for the applicant further argued that the said sample had been sent for testing after a delay of twenty days, which was also in clear violation of the said Standing Order, as it is provided in it that the contraband should be sent for chemical analysis 2 within a period of 72 hours.  At the outset, the Court referred to the ruling of the Apex Court in the case of Noor Aga v. State of Punjab (2008) 3 JIC 640 (SC), wherein it was held that the standing order in dispute and other guidelines issued by the authority having legal sanction are required to be complied by the arresting authorities. Further, the Court also referred to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Union of India vs. Shiv Shankar Keshari (2007) 7 SCC 798, wherein it was held that the court, while considering the application for bail with reference to Section 37 of the Act is not called upon to record a finding of not guilty.  "It is for the limited purpose essentially confined to the question of releasing the accused on bail that the court is called upon to see if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty and records its satisfaction about the existence of such grounds. But the court has not to consider the matter as if it is pronouncing a judgment of acquittal and recording a finding of not guilty," the Court had held. In view of this, the Court granted bail to the accused Verma on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.   
The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) recently upheld the life sentence awarded to a man for raping a 3-year-old girl. The court noted that the accused had left an indelible mark of devastation on the mind and body of the victim. The Bench of Justice Satyendra Kumar Singh and Justice Subodh Abhyankar observed that in view of the rights and plight of the victim and her family members, the Life imprisonment awarded to the appellant is by no means severe or excessive. The facts in brief  Accused Pappu was convicted for offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(F) of the I.P.C. by the Additional Sessions Judge, Dhar and he was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25,000/- and in default of payment of fine, one-year additional rigorous imprisonment.  Challenging his conviction and sentence, he had moved to the HC. Besides challenging his conviction, the Accused submitted that he had been in jail since last around 10 years and considering the aforesaid quality of evidence available against him, his sentence may be reduced to 10 years (period already undergone) which is the minimum sentence under Section 376(2)(f) of the IPC. As per the prosecution's case, the victim's mother had put the victim by the side of the appellant (with whom she had cordial relations) who was sleeping on the ground and when she came back to take her after half an hour, she found that the appellant had kept his face covered with bedding but when she took her daughter in her arms, her hands had blood on them as her daughter was bleeding from her private parts profusely.  Initially, she was asked not to tell anyone about the incident by the family of the appellant, however, after around 4-5 days, the mother of the victim informed her about the incident to her sister-in-law and thereafter her brother and husband also came to know about it and the FIR was lodged. Court's observations  The Court noted the doctor who examined the victim had given her opinion that internal pain by the victim was suggestive of penetration. The Court found that this evidence was supported by the testimony of the mother of the victim.  In view of this, being satisfied with the testimony of the doctor, the Court observed that it had no reason to disbelieve the deposition of the mother of the victim and her dilemma in going to the police station straight away.  In such circumstances, the Court added, we do not have any hesitation to come to a conclusion that the victim was raped by the present appellant who was only three years old at the time of the incident. "...this Court finds that the victim in the present case was a girl aged 3 years only, who was ravished by the appellant in whom the mother of the victim had shown full confidence when she left her daughter asleep alongside him, assuming that her daughter would be in the safe custody of the appellant, aged around 22 years but little did she know that appellant would not only break her faith but would also leave an indelible mark of devastation on the mind and body of the victim, in such circumstances, the rights and plight of the victim and her family members cannot be lost sight of, and thus, we find that the Life imprisonment awarded to the appellant is by no means severe or excessive," the Court further remarked. Accordingly, the instant appeal being devoid of merits stood dismissed. Case title - PAPPU v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH [CRIMINAL APPEAL No. 1132 of 2012]   
The Karnataka High Court recently set aside the conviction and sentence of life imprisonment imposed on a woman for allegedly causing the death of her two months old girl-child, who was suffering from epilepsy and some respiratory problems, by throwing her into a river.  A division bench of Justices KS Somashekar and Shivashankar Amarannavar acquitted the accused Kavitha who has been in custody for the last six years for committing an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The bench directed her forthwith release from prison if not wanted in any other case.  The criminal law was set into motion based on the complaint lodged by the child's father, Manjunatha. The prosecution examined 15 witnesses whereas the accused denied the incriminating evidence. She, however, did not lead any defence evidence.  Subsequently, the trial Court, heavily relying on the evidence of the child's doctor, the doctor who conducted her autopsy and the Investigating Officer, came to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved its case against the accused for the offence punishable under section 302 of IPC. It observed that from the circumstances and evidence produced before it, the only inference that can be drawn from the completed chain of events is that the accused threw the child into the river and killed her.  In appeal, Advocate RP Chandrashekar for the woman, alleged that her husband and the child's father who had initiated the complaint had turned hostile. It was further alleged that the evidence of her child's doctor does not support the case of the prosecution to prove that she has caused the death of her baby.  Moreover, it was argued that the witnesses examined by the prosecution to prove the last seen theory had also turned hostile and did not supported the prosecution.  Additional SPP Vijaykumar Majage on the other hand submitted that the accused threw the child since it was suffering with breathing problem and epilepsy and she did not have enough milk to feed the child. It was argued that the accused was well aware that a two months old child would drown in the river and it is with an intention to kill, that she threw it.  Findings:  The bench referred to the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Lalit Kumar & Ors. v. Superintendent & Remembrancer, AIR 1989 SC 2134, wherein it is held that the power of an Appellate Court to review evidence in appeals against acquittal is as extensive as its power in appeals against convictions, but Appellate Court should always be re-appreciating the evidence and revisiting the entire evidence as well as marking of the documents on their part to prove the guilt against the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.  It then said, "In the instant case, the Trial Court has given more credentiality to the evidence of PW.3 (child's doctor), PW.14 (doctor who conducted autopsy) and PW.15 (Investigating Officer)."  The High Court emphasized that it is the quality of evidence and not the quantity of evidence which must weigh the Court's opinion. Further, it opined that the solitary statement of a witness can be considered only if the court comes to the conclusion that such statement is the true and also correct version of the case.  In this vein, the Court observed, "In the instant case, the importance of corroboration of the evidence which was facilitated by the prosecution, it must be positive, cogent, consistent and probabalized that the accused had committed the murder of the deceased. But in the instant case, Kavitha who is none other than the mother of the deceased baby aged two months, though the prosecution in their case put on trial of this accused, subjected examination of PW.1 to PW.15, but no worthwhile evidence has been facilitated by the prosecution for securing the conviction of the accused for the offence under section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 1860."  Accordingly it held, "Therefore, in this appeal it requires intervention. If not intervened by re-appreciation of evidence and also revisiting judgment of conviction and order of sentence, certainly there shall be some substantial miscarriage of justice to the accused, who is gravamen of the accusations."

The Supreme Court recently quashed a detention order after noting that the authority considered the representation of the detenu after a long delay. The Court observed that in the matter of considering representation made against detention order, the Competent Authority is duty-bound to do so with "utmost despatch". The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar was considering a special leave petition assailing order dated November 18, 2021 passed by the Madras High Court, Bench at Madurai ("impugned order"). In the impugned order the High Court rejected the writ petition challenging the detention order dated July 20, 2021 passed by the District Collector and District Magistrate under the Tamil Nadu Act, 14/1982-Serving of Orders against one Kalyanaodai Senthil @ Senthil who is now confined in Central Prison, Cuddalore. While allowing the appeal in S. Amutha V. The Government Of Tamil Nadu & Ors, the bench observed,  "The explanation offered by the Competent Authority, who was called upon to decide the representation, to say the least, is unacceptable. For, in the matter of considering representation made against detention order, the Competent Authority is duty bound to do so with utmost despatch. The vague explanation of being pre- engaged with other official work for more than two months, cannot be countenanced in law. Notably, no details of the official work have been furnished, much less to indicate that it was relatively so urgent that the obligation to decide the representation against detention order with promptitude could wait for two months." The bench said that although the detention order referred to the detenu's questionable activities that could have been good reason for detaining him by way of preventive action but the issue in the present case what whether the representation dated July 30, 2021 made by the detenu to Additional Chief Secretary to the Government, Home, Prohibition & Excise Department had been considered with utmost despatch by the appropriate authority. Setting aside the impugned judgement and allowing the appellant's writ of quashing of the stated detention order the bench said,  "In the present case, it is an admitted position that the representation dated 30.7.2021 was received in the office of the concerned Authority on 18.8.2021, the Minister cleared the file finally on 20.10.2021. Even if, it may not be a case of lethargy of the Competent Authority to consider the representation, the time period of over two months spent in doing so, cannot be countenanced. It does not require such a long time to examine the representation concerning preventive detention of the detenu." Directions were also issued to be set free forthwith in case he was not required in connection with any criminal case pending against him. Case Title: S. Amutha v.

The division bench of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice Sudesh Bansal, observed, "Insofar as the Government's desire to regularise the existing land uses, the same falls into broad categories, (a) where agricultural land is put to non-agricultural use without permission and (b) where such lands as aforesaid or other lands of nonagricultural character which have been put to uses other than land use specified in the development plans. So far as clause (a) category of uses are concerned, per se we find no illegality in the approach of the Government. The Government has the authority in terms of Section 90B of the Act of 1956 as it stood at the relevant time and Section 90-A as it stands today to regularise such unauthorised land conversions."  So far as clause (b) land category is concerned, the Court opined that must strictly conform to the Gulab Kothari judgment (infra). Essentially, the challenge of the petitioner pertains to the question of regularising kachchi basties and illegal encroachments made on public land. The case of the petitioner is that these Government decisions and the corresponding statutory changes are opposed to the judgments and orders of this Court in case of Gulab Kothari and even otherwise illegal and impermissible.  Gulab Kothari's Observations  Notably, in Gulab Kothari, Editor, Rajasthan, Patrika, Jaipur v. State of Rajasthan (Gulab Kothari-1) [2017(1) DNJ(Raj.) 147, it was observed that under the scheme of Urban Improvement Trust Act, the urban areas in respect of which master plan is once prepared, the sanctity thereof has to be maintained and all improvement schemes of various zones and development work to be undertaken by the local authorities or the private entities must conform to the land use specified under such master plan. It was observed that though the Act does not provide for modification of the master plan during its operative period, such power to modify or revise the plan is inherent.  This decision of Gulab Kothari-1 was carried in appeal before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court placed the matter back to the High Court to be considered by a bench of three Judges. A further detailed order was passed by the Larger Bench of three Judges on 15.12.2018, Gulab Kothari-2 [2019 (1) WLC (Raj.) 645]. The fundamental issue considered in these judgments was of haphazard unplanned development of urban centers in the State.  The directions issued by the Court thus were for the purpose of preserving the sanctity of developing plans and to ensure that the future development takes place strictly in terms of the provisions made in the plan and no existing development which is contrary to the land use permitted under the plan is regularised. (Read para 51 onwards) Findings  The court examined the State Government's policy expressed in the impugned circulars and orders from three angles, namely  (i) the decisions of the Division Bench and Larger Bench in case of Gulab Kothari;  (ii) whether these policies can be implemented within the existing statutory framework, and the validity of the statutory amendments under challenge; and;  (iii) whether in the process of implementing these policies the State Government has in any manner breached the principle of public trust.  In the present matter, the court observed that lands of non-agricultural character which have been put to uses other than land use specified in the development plans, then any such regularisation of the land use, must strictly conform to the Gulab Kothari judgments. The court ordered that no construction in the guise of operating any of the provisions of the scheme which cannot be regularised as per the existing bye-laws, would be regularised. Unless and until the Government brings a valid legislation, Gulab Kothari directions must apply.  The court ruled that the decision to regularise the kachchi bastis, per se, is not opposed to any of the Gulab Kothari's principle as long as the Government sticks to its stand of not granting leases to the residents of such kachchi bastis which have developed on reserved facility areas such as park, playground, roads, open land, public land etc.; reserved land, forest land, river, drain, ponds and other restricted areas. The vires of challenged statutory provisions failed, the court ruled further.  The court further opined that insofar as the impugned Government circulars pertaining to recognising the rights over properties and granting lease deeds subject to terms and conditions indicated, the same are not opposed to the Gulab Kothari judgments nor are impermissible in any other manner.  It was pointed out to the court that Gulab Kothari related issues are still pending before the Larger Bench and one possible approach is to place these petitions for hearing before the same Bench where a holistic view can be taken. The court remarked it chose to continue and complete the hearing because, firstly, by then considerable judicial time was already consumed, which would go totally waste if no finality was given to these petitions. Secondly, formation of a larger bench in Gulab Kothari would mean disturbing several benches and current roster.  Refusing to accept the vires of the impugned provisions as unconstitutional, the court relied on Apex Court's decision in State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa (1974), wherein it was observed that if there is a presumption of constitutionality of a statute the onus is on the one who urges that the same is unconstitutional, to produce necessary material in support of such a contention.  Further reliance was placed on the Supreme Court's case of State of Andhra Pradesh v. Mcdowell & Company (1996), whereby it was held that the statute framed by the Parliament or State legislature can be challenged only on the ground that the same is not within the legislative competence of the concerned legislature or is opposed to any other fundamental right or any of the provisions of the Constitution. This principle has been expanded by a Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017), where it has been held that a legislation can also be challenged on the ground of manifest arbitrariness, added the court.  Arguments  The counsel for the petitioner raised following contentions:-  (i) The Government decisions are in conflict with the judgments in case of Gulab Kothari and the directions contained therein. He demonstrated that the Government scheme and policy cannot be implemented in view of the restrictions imposed by this Court in Gulab Kothari.  (ii) Government policy is even otherwise illegal. The policy envisages regularisation of landholdings by the encroachers on the private as well as public lands. It also envisages regularisation of construction which has been carried out without any permission from the local authority whatsoever. Both these steps would be taken even if the land use is opposed to the approved plans. Any such permission by the Government would lead to haphazard and unplanned growth of the towns and cities in the State and which even otherwise would be opposed to the Urban Improvement Act and other land laws.  (iii) That the proposed regularisation scheme of the State Government would be damaging to the environment and ecology also.  In contrast, the counsel for the state submitted that the State Government has framed a policy in the larger interest and the scope of judicial review of such decisions is available on extremely limited grounds. He argued that this policy is not opposed to any of the directives in case of Gulab Kothari nor is unreasonable or arbitrary. He further argued that the Government has the necessary mandate to make policy changes and also has the wherewithal to frame such policy with the aid and advise of the experts in the field. The Court would ordinarily not interfere in such policy matters, he added.  Adv. Moti Singh and Adv. Manoj Bohra appeared for the petitioner, while Sr. Adv. Kailash Vasdev, Sr. Adv. Harin P. Raval, AAG Sandeep Shah, Adv. Shrey Kapoor Adv. Akshit Singhvi, AAG Sunil Beniwal, Adv. Abhimanyu Singh Rathore and Adv. Saransh Vij appeared for the respondents. Case Title: Bhanwar Singh v.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that recovery of an article/weapon from a place hitherto unknown to anybody else including the investigating officer, is a fact that underlines the confirmation theory which is at the heart of provisions of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The bench of Justice Suneet Kumar and Justice Jyotsna Sharma observed thus as it affirmed the conviction of a murder accused who had murdered his pregnant step-mother along with her three kids i.e., his step-siblings. The Court also took into account the fact that the accused had himself retrieved a blood-stained axe, hidden inside the bushes in the presence of the police and a witness [PW9-Ishrar] on the next of the incident and the same was an admissible piece of evidence under section 27 of Indian Evidence Act. It may be noted that the conditions necessary for the applicability of Section 27 of the Evidence Act [How much of information received from accused may be proved] are: (1) Discovery of fact in consequence of information received from the accused; (2) Discovery of such fact to be deposed to; (3) The accused must be in police custody when he gave information and (4) So much of information as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered is admissible. The case in brief As per the FIR, the informant-Abdul Rashid (father of the accused), on returning to his house, found a crowd of people at his doorstep and was told by them that his own son Shamshad, who was in an inebriated state, assaulted and inflicted wounds by a 'kulhari' on the neck of the informant's wife (Chhoti), and his 3 children. It was also mentioned in the FIR that the people of the locality saw the accused Shamshad escaping with 'kulhari' held in his hands. Before the Court, PW1-Chhotte and PW2-Sirajuddin, the residents of the same Village deposed that the victim was often harassed by his stepson (accused) and on the day of occurrence, when they went to her house they saw with their own eyes that the Accused was assaulting the deceased persons with an axe inflicting injuries. When they tried to intervene, he ran towards them in attacking mode. The witnesses tried to catch hold of him, but he escaped towards the jungle and could not be apprehended. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that the testimony of PW-4 (father of the accused) evoked confidence and was one of the most important pieces of evidence in this case and the same came within the scope of Section 6 of the Indian Evidence Act. Regarding the recovery of the weapon, the Court noted that PW9-Ishrar and PW10- S.I. Sri Ram testified that the blood-stained axe was recovered (at the instance of the accused) from a spot different from the place of occurrence of the crime.  "In this case before us, the evidence of PW9 and PW10 further strengthens the prosecution case in the light of the above provisions of law. In our view, the evidence led by the prosecution on this count, is not only admissible and relevant under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act but also tantamounts to the evidence of the conduct of an accused which too is relevant," the Court remarked as it noted that no plausible explanation was offered by accused in his defence. With this, the Court held that the appeal lacked merits and was liable to be dismissed and was thereby dismissed and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Case title - Shamshad v.

Granting anticipatory bail to a biker accused of performing dangerous stunts on a public road, the Madras High Court directed the 22-year-old to upload a video on his Instagram account against reckless driving and also report before a trauma ward duty doctor at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for three weeks.

Granting anticipatory bail to a biker accused of performing dangerous stunts on a public road, the Madras High Court directed the 22-year-old to upload a video on his Instagram account against reckless driving and also report before a trauma ward duty doctor at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for three weeks.  The directions are part of the conditions imposed by the court while granting him the pre-arrest bail. Justice AD Jagadish Chandira ordered the accused to report to the Duty Doctor at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and assist the Ward Boys at the Trauma Ward in taking care of the patients from Tuesday to Saturday between 8 am and 12 PM for three weeks.  "He shall also submit one page report daily about his experience in the Trauma Ward to the Duty Doctor and thereafter, the Dean shall forward the reports submitted by him at the end of three weeks to this Court," said the court. Considering that the accused has over 40,000 followers on Instagram, the court asked him to upload a video on his Instagram account "against reckless driving, drunken driving and insisting of wearing helmets and seat belts during driving". The accused has been further directed to file an affidavit that he will not indulge in such acts on the road, and distribute pamphlets at a traffic signal containing awareness messages against "reckless driving, drunken driving and insisting for wearing helmets and seat belts during driving."  The pamphlet distribution has to be done at Teynampet-Mount Road Junction signal on every Monday between 9.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for a period of three weeks, as per the order. The court noted that the accused, who is a young motorcycle enthusiast and is also an active user of Instagram, had driven the vehicle in a reckless manner and caused fear and panic among drivers and pedestrians travelling on the road. "The petitioner is an youngster active in social media with huge followers, instead of being role model to youngsters, he is alleged to have set a bad example by driving the vehicle in a reckless manner on the main road, instilling fear in the minds of the pedestrians," said the bench. However, the court took into consideration the petitioner's age and said if he is arrested and sent to jail, it would affect his future and career.  "Further, the entire episode is available in CCTV footage, this Court is of the opinion that custodial interrogation is not required and anticipatory bail may be granted to the petitioner by imposing certain conditions that would in a way reform him," added the court The court also noted that some of the co-accused, who were arrested, have been granted bail.  The prosecution case was that the petitioner along with seven others had driven their motorcycles in a reckless and zig zag manner at midnight in Anna Salai. They created loud noises, caused panic among other vehicle users and pedestrians, and endangered their safety, according to the police. While seeking anticipatory bail, the petitioner submitted that he was a motorcycle enthusiast and a BTech dropout. Though he had used his motorcycle skills for wrong purpose, he had no intention to attempt to commit culpable homicide, his counsel submitted. The court was also told that other Section 308 IPC, other offences under the Motor Vehicles Act in the case are bailable in nature. Opposing the grant of bail, the State submitted that the petitioner, who had about forty thousand followers on Instagram, had set a bad example for the youngsters and uploaded videos of the wheelie on social media .  The court was also informed that the petitioner had come all the way from Hyderabad to perform the "illegal acts", with the knowledge that their acts would endanger the life of pedestrians and co-drivers.  The petitioner however submitted that there was no complaint and no body was injured. Even going by the prosecution version, the alleged act of the petitioner was uploaded in the social media and the entire incident was recorded in the CCTV cameras, his counsel argued, adding in such a situation, there was no requirement for custodial interrogation.  Case Title: Gotla Alex Binoy v.

Noting that several tribals were denied supplies under the Public Distribution System due to the non-linking of their Aadhar Cards, even as the fortunates eagerly awaited Diwali, the Bombay High Court ordered the Tehsildar of Murbad to distribute supplies to nearly 90 tribals by November 4.

Noting that several tribals were denied supplies under the Public Distribution System due to the non-linking of their Aadhar Cards, even as the fortunates eagerly awaited Diwali, the Bombay High Court ordered the Tehsildar of Murbad to distribute supplies to nearly 90 tribals by November 4.    In an interim order, Justices Prasanna Varale and Madhav Jamdar observed no logic, reason or rationale for denying the benefits of distribution of food grains under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) to the tribals on raising certain technical grounds.  The court ordered the distribution of food grains to tribal beneficiaries under NFSA and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, after verifying their ration cards.   "It is a disheartening situation for us when we the fortunates are eagerly awaiting as the festive season is approaching and the festival of lights would spread joy and happiness in the society throughout the State or the whole nation, here are the few petitioners who are the members of the marginalised section in general and tribals in particular who have approached this Court on a grievance that they are deprived of the basic requirement of human life, i.e., food, only on account that the State machinery is not technically equipped to give them the benefits flowing from the scheme formulated and floated by the Union of India and to be implemented and executed by the respective States."  The State claimed that Aadhaar cards linked to a different place than the residence of these individuals were the reason behind non-distribution. However, the court noted that illiterate tribals approach ration shop owners to link their Aadhar cards to the portal.   "…if a mistake is committed by shop owner, the same cannot be the reason for denial of food grains to the ration cardholder under the benevolent schemes," the court noted.  State Can Also use ration Card to Identify Beneficiary   The State also cited a government circular from October 2013. According to the circular, the Aadhar of every family member in the ration card must be linked to the portal for the benefits of PDS.  However, the court observed that the requirements are in stark opposition to a central government notification dated February 8 2017, which clearly states that the Aadhaar Card is only one of the criteria for identifying the Beneficiary, not the sole criteria.  "There is another document on which the beneficiary can rely upon to receive the benefits of the scheme, and that is "ration card" issued by the State of Union Territory Administration, Food Department."  Even If One Member's Aadhar Linked, Entire Family Eligible for Food   The court observed that according to clause 5 of the centre's notification, any member of an eligible household listed in the ration card shall be entitled to receive the entire quantity of cash transfer or food subsidy under NFSA, if even one member fulfils the identification conditions, in case of Aadhaar number is not yet assigned to all.  The court relied on the Supreme Court's observations in K. S. Puttaswamy v/s. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1, popularly known as "Aadhaar Card Judgment." The court held that beneficial schemes are not charity or doles and that technology shall not be a rider to implement beneficial schemes.  "Our quest for technology should be oblivious to the country's real problems; social exclusion, impoverishment and marginalisation. The Aadhar project suffers from crucial design flaws which impact upon its structural probity. Structural design in delivering welfare entitlements must be compliant with structural due process, to be in accord with Articles 14 and 21," the court observed quoting the judgement.  Regarding the case at hand, the court said the beneficiaries were tribals, majority of them being illiterate. "As such, they rely on the action taken by the respective ration shop owner, and in such case, if a mistake is committed by shop owner, the same cannot be the reason for denial of food grains to the ration card holder under the benevolent schemes," the court said.   A social worker overlooking the case of the tribals told Live Law that over half of tribals in 22 sectors had received food grains. However, only the list of names provided to authorities was looked into.   "The court had ordered aide to be given to similarly placed tribals as well. However, that is yet to happen," the social worker said.         
The Kerala High Court Monday considered the legal question that whether in a case of recovery of contraband on driver's body search, it would be fair to hold that the vehicle also had been used for the purpose of conveying the contraband. Justice A. Badharudeen said when contraband is recovered on search of a person, who is driving the vehicle alone, after compliance of Section 50 of NDPS Act, it would not be safe to hold that vehicle also was used for transporting the drug so as to make the vehicle a subject matter of confiscation. "In such circumstances, it has to be held that, the contraband was kept in secrecy by the accused in his body though he had travelled in the vehicle. Viewing so, it cannot be said that, in the present case, the vehicle has been used as conveyance and the vehicle is a subject matter of confiscation." The court was hearing an appeal of an accused against the dismissal of an application seeking interim custody of the car. The accused had been found in possession of 0.06 grams of LSD stamp in his wallet, while he was in the car. He had argued before the Special Court that the vehicle was never used as a conveyance to transport the contraband.  The trial court had said the vehicle could not be released since the materials available suggests that the vehicle was used to convey the contraband recovered from the accused.  It was contended by the counsel representing the accused that even a meticulous reading of the recovery mahazar does not suggest that the vehicle was used as conveyance, so as to hold that it to be a subject matter of confiscation On the other hand, the Public Prosecutor argued that the accused was intercepted while he was driving the car, and the same would indicate that the vehicle was used as a conveyance.  The Court said the observations in Shajahan v. Inspector of Excise, Excise Enforcement & Anti Narcotic Special Squad Malappuram & Ors — wherein it was held that if the vehicle is a subject matter of confiscation, the power of the Court to consider a claim under Section 451 of Cr.P.C stands denuded, would apply only to a case where there is material to hold that the vehicle was used as a conveyance to carry the contraband.  Observing that the Special Judge wrongly dismissed the application, the court set aside the order and directed the vehicle to be released to the petitioner on production of original RC Book and Insurance Certificate for verification before the Special Judge. "Thereafter, the learned Special Judge shall release the car to the petitioner on executing bond for Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Only) by the petitioner with two solvent sureties, each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the Special Court, undertaking to produce the vehicle before the Court, as and when directed," the court said. The court further directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating that the vehicle shall not be sold without the prior permission of the Special Court or till disposal of the case. Petitioner was represented by Advocates T. SANJAY, P.P. NIYAS, SANIL KUMAR G. and MIDHUN R. Government Pleader G. Sudheer represented the State. Case Title: Wilson C.C. v. State of Kerala      
The Delhi High Court has ruled that the right to privacy is essentially a right in personam and therefore is not inheritable by the mothers or legal heirs of the deceased persons. Justice Neena Bansal Krishna made the observation while refusing to grant interim relief in a suit filed against Bollywood Filmmaker Hansal Mehta and others for restraining the release of their film 'Faraaz'. The movie is based on the terrorist attack that happened on 1st July, 2016 in Holey Artisan, Dhaka, Bangladesh. The suit was filed by a family that had lost their daughters in the attack. They feared that their daughters may be shown in a bad light and hence, prayed for an injunction in their favour.  The film was alleged to be violative of their right to Privacy and right to Fair Trial under Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Denying interim relief to the plaintiffs, the court observed that while the 'right to be left alone' is an aspect of right to privacy, however, it "can also operate" within its limits and cannot be termed as a right to be left alone especially when the plaintiffs barely get any mention in the movie.  The plaintiffs have not been able to make out any case of "being left alone" once breach of Privacy itself has not been established, the court said.  The court was of the view that irreparable loss and injury would be caused to the defendants if they were injuncted from screening the movie after having invested their money in preparing the same, essentially when the plaintiffs were not able to demonstrate what irreparable loss and injury was caused to them from screening of the film.  "It may thus be concluded that the plaintiffs have not been able to establish any of the three limbs i.e. prima facie case, balance of convenience or irreparable loss or injury in their favour. The plaintiffs are, therefore, not entitled to injunction. The interim stay order stands vacated," the court said while dismissing the application seeking ad-interim injunction. The court observed that the sphere of privacy stretches at one end to those intimate matters to which a reasonable expression of privacy may attach and to matters of anonymity on the other hand.  "A distinction has been made between anonymity on one hand and privacy on the other. Both anonymity and privacy prevent others from gaining access to pieces of personal information yet they do so in opposite ways. Privacy involves hiding information whereas anonymity involves hiding what makes it personal," the court said.  The court also opined that the right to privacy being a basic human right, is entitled to be protected under common law by way of an injunctive relief. It was observed that the right to privacy of the mothers of the two girls who died in the attack, was in no way getting impinged by the movie.  "Neither is the privacy of the mother's/ plaintiff's in any way being compromised nor is there any affront to their dignity and privacy, merely because their two daughters happened to be the victims of the terror attack. The plaintiffs may have been successful if their personal right to privacy was in any way being infringed by the making of this movie but unfortunately, no such circumstance has been pleaded by the plaintiffs," the court said. It was observed that it may not be correct to say that screening of a movie would cause any kind of trauma and upheaval specially when the incident had happened in the year 2016 and the movie in question was intended to be screened in 2022. "The proximity to the incident is also proportionate to the trauma that may be caused to the plaintiffs. The proximity to the incident is a relevant consideration to decide if this can be a reason for injuncting the screening of the movie," the court said. The court also noted that the disclaimer given by the defendants in the movie prima facie takes care of the concerns expressed by the plaintiff.  An assurance was given to the plaintiffs that the names of the two girls had not been used in the movie adding that in no way is the identity of the two girls disclosed. In this backdrop, the court said "Merely because the two girls may get identified from the material already available and the extensive reporting of the incident, would not be a sufficient ground to create an apprehension of a laudatory role given to Faraaz and rise into a higher level of humanity by sacrificing his own life to save the life of the two girls which is intended to be brought in the public domain." On the plaintiffs' argument on a right to fair trial, the court said that there was no explanation given as to whose right to fair trial was claimed and in what manner would the movie impact the right of fair trial of any of the stakeholders. While adjudicating on the aspect of defamation and emotional trauma, the court said that defamation of a deceased person does not give rise to a civil right of action and common law in favour of the surviving family or relatives who are not defamed themselves. The court said "The defamatory matter must be published concerning the plaintiff. As a matter of sound public policy, malicious defamation of the memory of a dead is condemned as an affront to the general sentiments of morality and decency, and the interest of society demand its punishment through the criminal courts but the law does not contemplate the offence as causing any special damage to another individual, though related to the deceased, and therefore, it cannot be made the basis for recovery in a civil action." It added "Where one is supposed to stand upon his own merits and where success or failure is entirely dependent upon the accidents of rank of family connection. A defamation of such character however grievous or disturbing can afford no injury that can be measured by a pecuniary standard." Therefore, the court also observed that emotional trauma per se may be relevant as a component of defamation, but it cannot be the sole basis for making a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiffs in the matter. "The defamation, as already discussed above, is a personal right and is not pre-emptive in nature. Without having seen the movie and without there being any basis, the plaintiffs have not been able to explain as to which aspect of the movie is defamatory. The defamation essentially can be asserted only after the movie has been released," the court said. Title: RUBA AHMED & ANR. v. HANSAL MEHTA & ORS.    
Stressing that the preventive detention law "strikes hard on the freedom and liberty of an individual, and cannot be exercised in a routine manner", the Supreme Court has observed that "the powers to be exercised under this law are exceptional powers which have been given to the government for its exercise in an exceptional situation". The Court has once again highlighted the distinction that while a law and order situation can be dealt with under the ordinary law of land, it is only when there is a public order situation that the invocation of the powers under the law of Preventive Detention is justified, absent which the preventive detention would be bad and would be in violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution as it encroaches upon the liberty and freedom of an individual.The bench of Justices C. T. Ravikumar and Sudhanshu Dhulia  was hearing an appeal against the March decision of the Telangana High Court by which the Habeas Corpus Writ Petition of the petitioner- wife challenging the order of prevention of detention of her husband had been dismissed. The brief facts of the case, as recorded by the top court, are that the prevention detention order was passed against the husband of the petitioner on 28th October, 2021 by the Commissioner of Police, Rachakonda Commissionerate on grounds that the detenu was involved in gold chain snatching offences, where victims were mostly women. He has been doing this since the year 2020 in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He was involved in as many as 36 gold chain snatching offences. Earlier, the detenu, along with three others, had formed a gang to commit these offences in order to make quick money. It was alleged that they had come to Hyderabad in a car and took shelter in a lodge. Their modus operandi was to first conduct recce of some residential areas and after selecting a suitable residential area, lift two wheelers and motor cycles which were then used in the chain snatching offences. The Apex Court recorded that although according to the Authority the detenu was involved in more than 30 cases but only 4 cases of chain snatching were considered as ground for detention, as the other cases were reported to be behind the proximity period and out of the jurisdiction of Commissionerate. The bench of Justices Ravikumar and Dhulia noted that in short, against the detenu the F.I.Rs  are primarily for an offence of 'robbery' under section 392 of the IPC; that the detention order also says that the crimes were committed in broad daylight and have thus resulted in creation of fear and panic in the minds of the general public, especially women and hence, the government had to interfere in order to "maintain public order". "The said four cases were allegedly committed by the detenu within a span of two months between 06.05.2021 to 26.07.2021 and were committed within the jurisdiction of one police station i.e., Medipalli police station. In all these cases, the detenu had moved bail applications before the concerned Metropolitan Magistrate and was granted bail under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C, which is commonly known as 'default bail' and the detenu was released on 16.10.2021. The detention order was later passed on 28.10.2021, which was subsequently confirmed by the Advisory Council on 13.01.2022, i.e., within the stipulated time. The detenu is under detention since 28.10.2021. The Preventive Detention Law, under which the powers have been exercised is a long winded statute called the 'Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Boot-Leggers, Dacoits, Drug-Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders Land-Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders Act, 1986'", noted the bench. The bench noted that the powers have been exercised in the present case under section 3(1) of the Act; that under the aforesaid provision, inter alia, a detention order can be passed against a "goonda", and a "goonda" has been defined under Section 2 (g) of the Act; that since the allegation is that the detenu is involved in four cases of chain snatching i.e., robbery, which comes under offences given under Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code, he has been declared a habitual offender and thus a "goonda" vide the detention order dated 28.10.2021; and that under section 3(1) of the Act, detention order can be passed, inter alia, against a "goonda", "with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order...", and due to the detenu's alleged involvement in four criminal cases relating to "robbery" he has been declared a "goonda" and it is said that this is acting in a manner which is "prejudicial to the maintenance of public order". "A bare reading of the aforesaid provision shows that the "maintenance of public order" has a crucial bearing here and unless the government is justified in holding that the act of the detenu is prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, the preventive detention would be bad and would be in violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India as it encroaches upon the liberty and freedom of an individual",  observed the bench. Continuing, the bench asserted that there is absolutely no doubt in its mind that the facts and circumstances of the case as alleged in the detention order dated 28.10.2021 reflect a law and order situation which can be dealt with under the ordinary law of land, and that there was absolutely no occasion for invoking the extraordinary powers under the law of Preventive Detention. "The reasons assigned by the authority in its detention, justifying the invocation of the provisions of the detention law are that the detenu has been granted bail in all the four cases and since he is likely to indulge in similar crime, hence the order of preventive detention. The reason why bail was granted in all four cases, however, has not been given. Bail was granted in all the four cases due to the inability of the prosecution, which did not complete its investigation in time. The bail had to be given as the charge sheet was not filed by the police in all the cases within the stipulated period of 60 days. The fault thus lies with the prosecution. The other reason assigned is that the Trial Court while granting bail did not lay down any conditions. This is again a wrong presentation of the case. Conditions were not imposed simply as it was a default bail, and in bail of this nature conditions are not liable to be imposed",  discussed the bench. The bench was of the considered view that in the present case invocation of the Preventive Detention Law against the petitioner was not justified; that "the powers to be exercised under the Preventive Detention Law are exceptional powers which have been given to the government for its exercise in an exceptional situation as it strikes hard on the freedom and liberty of an individual, and thus cannot be exercised in a routine manner". "The distinction between law and order situation and a public order situation has been dealt with by the Supreme Court in a catena of decisions...In any case, the State is not without a remedy, as in case the detenu is much a menace to the society as is being alleged, then the prosecution should seek for the cancellation of his bail and/or move an appeal to the Higher Court. But definitely seeking shelter under the preventive detention law is not the proper remedy under the facts and circumstances of the case",  declared the bench.The Court referred to the precedent in Ram Manohar Lohia Vs. State of Bihar on the point of distinction between "public order" and "law and order". Mentioning how in a recent decision of the Supreme Court , the Court had to make an observation regarding the routine and unjustified use of the Preventive Detention Law in the state of Telangana, the bench allowed the appeal, set aside the order of detention dated 28.10.2021 and order dated 25.03.2022 of the Division Bench of the High Court and ordered that the detenu be released immediately in case he is not required in any other case.

The Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence awarded to a man accused of rape and murder of four year old girl. The bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and Bela M. Trivedi observed that the maximum punishment prescribed may not always be the determinative factor for repairing the crippled psyche of the offender. The Trial Court had awarded death sentence to the accused Firoz for the offence under section 302 of IPC and directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 07 years and pay fine of Rs. 2000/- for the offence under section 363, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years and pay fine of Rs. 2000/- for the offence under section 366 of IPC, to undergo life imprisonment and pay fine of Rs. 2000/- for the offences under sections 376(2)(i), 376(2)(m) of IPC and under sections 5(i)r/w 6 & 5(m) r/w 6 of POCSO Act. The High Court dismissed his appeal and confirmed the death sentence. In appeal, re-appreciating the evidence on record, the Apex Court bench held that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt all the circumstances individually and also proved the circumstances forming a chain, so conclusive as to rule out the possibility of any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused. Regarding the death sentence awarded for murder, the bench made the following observation: "While affirming the view taken by the courts below with regard to the conviction of the appellant for the offences charged against him, deem it proper to commute, and accordingly commute the sentence of death for the sentence of imprisonment for life, for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. Since, Section 376A IPC is also applicable to the facts of the case, considering the gravity and seriousness of the offence, the sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of appellant's natural life would have been an appropriate sentence, however, we are reminded of what Oscar Wilde has said - "The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future". One of the basic principles of restorative justice as developed by this Court over the years, also is to give an opportunity to the offender to repair the damage caused, and to become a socially useful individual, when he is released from the jail. The maximum punishment prescribed may not always be the determinative factor for repairing the crippled psyche of the offender. Hence, while balancing the scales of retributive justice and restorative justice, we deem it appropriate to impose upon the appellant-accused, the sentence of imprisonment for a period of twenty years instead of imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life for the offence under section 376A, IPC. The conviction and sentence recorded by the courts below for the other offences under IPC and POCSO Act are affirmed. It is needless to say that all the punishments imposed shall run concurrently."

The Supreme Court set aside murder conviction of a man accused of killing his wife and modified it to conviction under Section 304 Part II IPC. This is after the court found that the incident had occurred at the spur of the moment and the accused had taken immediate steps to shift his wife to the hospital. The accused was charged of murder of his wife and in this case the sole eyewitness account recorded was of his seven years old daughter. His conviction under Section 302 IPC by the Trial Court was upheld by the Delhi High Court. Before the Apex Court, the appellant accused contended that even if the incident is accepted in the manner in which it had occurred, it was at the spur of the moment. The court noted that there is detailed consideration made by the Trial Court and the High Court about the veracity of the evidence tendered by the child witness. The bench noted that the child witness had stated that her mother said something to her father on which the father started beating her mother ; that she was not able to open the latch of the door to her house and she thereafter went there ; that immediately her father had dressed up and moved her mother to the Hospital. "These aspects of the matter would indicate that there was no pre-mediation to cause the death and the incident had occurred at the spur of the moment and the appellant having realised his mistake had thereafter taken immediate steps to shift his wife to the hospital but unfortunately she breathed her last.", the bench of Justices AS Bopanna and PS Narasimha observed. The bench therefore modified the conviction to Section 304 Part II of IPC. As the accused has already undergone more 12 years of sentence, the court said that the period undergone will be sufficient punishment.

The Supreme Court has reiterated that Section 300 CrPC bars the trial of a person not only for the same offence but also for any other offence on the same facts. The court was hearing a Criminal Appeal that was filed assailing the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Kerala in Criminal Appeal Nos. 947 and 948 of 2009 by which the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed in C.C. No. 24 and 25 of 2003 by the Trial Court had been upheld by dismissing the aforesaid appeals and consequently confirming the conviction of the appellant herein. The Impugned Judgment The Trial Court vide its judgment and order dated 27.04.2009 in both the aforesaid cases had convicted the appellant for offences under Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and had sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rupees Two Thousand and in default thereof, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. The accused was further convicted for the offence under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rupees Two Thousand and in default thereof, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. The sentences were directed to run concurrently.  Brief Facts of the Case The allegation against the accused was that while the accused was working as Agricultural Officer, State Seed Farm, Perambra, for the period 31.05.1991 to 31.05.1994, he abused his official position as a public servant and committed criminal breach of trust and misappropriated amounts from the auctioning of coconuts during the period from 27.04.1992 to 25.08.1992, by not remitting the same to the Sub-Treasury, Perambra.  As a result of which a surprise inspection was carried out in the State Seed Farm, Perambra and the inspection team found that the cash book was not properly maintained and that the Agricultural Officer received amounts from the Treasury. The inspection report was submitted to the Director of Agriculture. On the basis of the said report, an enquiry was conducted by the vigilance department and a criminal case was registered against the accused. On completion of investigation, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau submitted three reports and three criminal cases were registered against the accused under Section 13(1)(c) read with Section 13(2) of the Act and Sections 409 and 477A of IPC. The Accounts Officer conducted an audit in the State Seed Farm, pertaining to the period from 31.05.1991 to 31.05.1994 and gave a report. On the basis of the same, the two cases, out of which this appeal arises, were registered against the appellant. Arguments of the Appellant The stand that the appellant took before the Supreme Court assailing the judgment of the Trial Court and later upheld by the High Court, is as follows: During the period in question, the Appellant had additional charge of some other farms and had to heavily depend on his subordinates at the office to conduct the affairs of the State Seed Farm, Perambra. The Appellant is a public servant. Section 197(1) of the CrPC requires sanction of the State Government before taking cognizance of offence against public servants such as the accused. The entire prosecution proceedings in the present cases are barred by Section 300(1) of the CrPC which incorporates the principle of double jeopardy. The Appellant was already prosecuted in the year 1999 for the charges of misappropriating public funds entrusted to him, when C.C. No.12 to 14/1999 were filed against him. The core allegation in all the five cases is one and the same i.e., making false entries in the cash book and misappropriating money. The FIR in the present cases was filed on 03.12.2001 after the appellant was dismissed from the service and the judgment of the Trial Court was passed. The allegations/offences in the present two cases could have been framed at the previous trial and the appellant herein could have been tried for the same along with the trial of the earlier three cases. If the Appellant was to be tried again for the present offences, previous consent of the State Government was necessary as is mandated under sub-section (2) of Section 300 of the CrPC. The conviction of the appellant herein under Section 409 of the IPC has no legal basis since the prosecution could not prove the most vital ingredient of the said offence, namely, entrustment of goods or dominion over property. The conviction under Section 13(1)(c) of the Act is not made out since the prosecution failed to prove that the property was entrusted to him or was under his control, and that the same was fraudulently or dishonestly misappropriated by him. Discussion on Double Jeopardy The court held, "Articles 20 to 22 deal with personal liberty of citizens and others. Article 20(2) expressly provides that no person shall be prosecuted or punished for the same offence, more than once. The protection against double jeopardy is also supplemented by statutory provisions contained in Section 300 of the CrPC, Section 40 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, Section 71 of the IPC and Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897."  Discussing the relevance of Section 300 CrpC, the court held, "Section 300 of the CrPC places a bar wherein, a person who has already been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction for an offence arising out of the same facts, and has either been acquitted or convicted of such offence cannot be tried again for the same offence as well as on the same facts for any other offence as long as such acquittal or conviction remains in force." Judgment Relating the mandate of Section 300 CrPC with the facts of the instant case, the court, in the words of Justice BV. Nagarathna, held, "The appellant herein was earlier charged for offences under Section 13(1)(c) read with Section 13(2) of the Act and Sections 409 and 477A of the IPC and was convicted in two cases and acquitted in one case. The present two cases arise out of the same set of facts and the same transaction as that in the previous three cases wherein the appellant was tried and convicted/acquitted respectively. For an offence to be considered as the 'same offence' as the last offence, it is necessary to show that the offences are not distinct and the ingredients of the offences are identical. The previous charge as well as the present charge is for the same period of misappropriation. The matter of offences in all the previous three cases and the present case are the same and are said to be committed in the course of the same transaction while holding the one and same post of Agricultural Officer by the appellant." The court further held that, "The appellant is right in contending that the charge in the first three cases were framed on 17.08.1999 which is much after the audit and the prosecution would have been well aware of the misappropriation in respect of the present cases on 17.08.1999." The court further remarked that, "It has already been observed that the allegations/offences in the instant cases are the same as the allegations/offences in the previous three cases, therefore as per the mandate under Section 300(2) of the CrPC, the consent of the State Government is necessary. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the allegations are different in present cases from those in the previous cases, the prosecution has failed to obtain the prior consent of the State Government necessary to prosecute the accused-appellant and therefore the trial in the instant case is unlawful." The judgment was delivered by the division bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and B.V. Nagarathna. Case title: T.P.

The Telangana High Court recently ruled that the road tax paid under the Motor Vehicles Act while purchasing the cars, and collection of toll tax at National Highway Toll Booths do not amount to double taxation.

The Telangana High Court recently ruled that the road tax paid under the Motor Vehicles Act while purchasing the cars, and collection of toll tax at National Highway Toll Booths do not amount to double taxation.  Issues raised by Petitioners in the PIL  The petitioners, who were advocates, had filed the writ petition by way of Public Interest Litigation stating that they were owners of motor vehicles, they had paid road tax at the time of purchase of the vehicles and the respondents were compelling them to pay toll tax which was in addition to the lifetime tax paid by the petitioners. The petitioners wanted the payment of toll tax to be declared as illegal and unjust.  The petitioners had also raised a grievance that toll-tax was not being paid by certain dignitaries and the exemption is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.  Response by NHAI  The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had stated that keeping in view the financial crunch which was in the way of development of Highways, the Central Government took a policy decision in order to ensure that funds were made available. By virtue of this, Section 8A was incorporated into the National Highways Act, 1956   The statutory provision empowered NHAI to enter into an agreement with any person in relation to the development and maintenance of the whole or part of the National highway. It also empowered any person, with whom such agreement had been entered into, to collect and retain fees for services or benefits rendered by him as the Central Government may provide by Notification having regard to the expenditure involved in building, maintenance, management and operation of the National Highway, interest on capital invested, reasonable return, volume of traffic and period of such agreement. Reliance was placed on State Lorry Owners' Federation, Tamilnadu v. the Superintending Engineer, AIR 1999 Mad 181, wherein it was held that collection of tax under the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act and levy of fees under the National Highway Rules do not amount to double taxation.  Court's observations  The court observed that the Government of India took a policy decision by adding Section 8A under the National Highways Act in order to provide road infrastructure throughout the country by way of Public Private Partnership (PPP) in the matter of construction, widening, upgradation and strengthening of roads. Even the Rules framed under the National Highways Act provide for collection of Toll Tax such as the National Highways (Collection of fees), The National Highways Fees (Determination of rates and Collections) Rules, 2008. Certain dignitaries are also clearly exempted from payment of fee as provided in Rules.  The Petitioner had not challenged the constitutional validity of Section 8A of the National Highways Act or the Rules thereunder. Therefore, the action of NHAI which is in consonance with the Act and Rules could not be interfered with.  The other important aspect was that service roads were available adjoining Highways and short distance travelers could freely avail the facility of service roads. Furthermore, in State Lorry Owners; Federation Tamil Nadu v. Superintending Engineer, 2001 the Madras High Court upheld the collection of fees towards the construction of bridges and roads.  Resultantly, the Court did not find any reason to grant the reliefs as no case was made out for interference in the matter. Therefore, the Public Interest Litigation was dismissed.  Case Title: D.

Observing that "guilt of the accused can be established only after examination of all the witnesses as desired by the prosecution," the Karnataka High Court recently set aside the order passed by a trial court acquitting a person accused of raping a minor.  A division bench of Justice G Narendar and Justice M I Arun, while allowing the appeal filed by the state government said, "The matter stands remanded back to the trial court to continue the trial with liberty being given to the prosecution to adduce necessary evidence."  The accused Santosh was acquitted of the charges under 376(2)(n) of IPC and Sections 5(j)(ii) and 6 of  POCSO ACT. The prosecution in its appeal contended that to prove its case, it had requested the permission of the court to examine other witnesses mentioned in the charge sheet. However, the trial court, on the ground that the victim and other material witnesses have turned hostile has rejected the prayer of the prosecution to examine other witnesses and has acquitted the accused.  Further, it was contended that the DNA test of the child and the accused has not been conducted and the trial Court has erred in not permitting the other witnesses to be examined by the prosecution including the Doctor, who has examined the victim.  However, the court on going through the record noted that the prosecution had not made the necessary application before the trial Court to have a DNA test conducted for relating the child with the accused. It said, "They cannot now turn around and argue that the trial court committed an error in not permitting the required DNA test."  Further, it said,  "Normally, it is obligatory on the part of the trial Court to permit the prosecution to examine the witnesses mentioned in the charge sheet to prove its case. However, in the instant case, as the victim girl, her father, mother, brother and sister have not supported the case of the prosecution, the trial Court on the ground that all the material witnesses have turned hostile has not permitted further examination of the witnesses and has acquitted the accused."   Taking note of the submissions of the prosecution that it has a good case on merits and that it would make necessary applications to have the DNA test conducted in respect of the accused and the child which will prove the case of the prosecution, the bench said,  "The guilt of the accused can be established only after examination of all the witnesses as desired by the prosecution. It is a specific case of the prosecution that it has the necessary evidence to prove the guilt of the accused and it is desirous of making the necessary application to have a DNA test conducted and that the material witnesses have turned hostile only on the false promise of the accused."  Considering the submission made by the prosecution and under the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the Court added, "the trial court clearly erred in not permitting the prosecution to lead necessary evidence to prove the guilt of the accused."  Case Background:  On 29.04.2019, the father of the victim lodged a complaint with the police stating that the accused made his 16-year old daughter believe that he would marry her and when no one was there in the house, he came and had forcible sexual intercourse with her. It was alleged that the accused then fled to his native place without telling anybody. Case Title: The State Of Karnataka v.

A Full Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday held that proceedings under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act can be challenged in the High Court only under Article 227 of the Constitution and not by invoking the court's power under Section 482 CrPC. The matter was referred to the bench of Justice PN Prakash, Justice RMT Teeka Raman and Justice AD Jagadish Chandira after Justice N Satish Kumar, while considering a batch of petitions seeking to quash the application filed under Section 12 of the DV Act by invoking the provision under Section 482 CrPC, in an order observed that a division bench's recent ruling on the legal question was not in consonance with the Supreme Court decisions.  A division bench of the court which ruled that proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act are civil in nature had also observed that Section 482 CrPC petition is maintainable in Domestic Violence Act proceedings. However, according to the single judge, the decision was not in consonance with the decisions of the Supreme Court and thus, he referred the matter to a larger bench to answer the following questions: Whether a proceeding under Section 12 of the D.V.Act can be challenged under Article 227 of the Constitution or under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.? Whether the aforesaid remedy is available to an aggrieved person before approaching the learned Magistrate and, if necessary, the Court of Sessions by way of an appeal under Section 29 of the D.V.Act? While disposing of the petition, the larger bench observed that the High Court did not have the powers to quash proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act through Section 482 of CrPC. It observed that this is because, under the Domestic Violence Act, a Magistrate court is the designated court to hear applications. Since Magistrate's court is not a criminal court, a petition under Section 482 is not maintainable. The High Court could thus entertain challenges against proceedings under Domestic Violence Act only under Article 227. The court thus upheld the decision of a single bench of the Madras High Court in Dr.P.Pathamnathan v. V.Monica to hold that proceedings under the DV Act are civil in nature.  In the above case, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh looked into the Statement of Objects of the Domestic Violence Act which spells out that the Act has been enacted mainly to address the absence of civil law remedies to the victims of an offence under Section 498-A IPC and also to provide a remedy under civil law to protect the women from being a victim of Domestic Violence and to prevent such occurrences. The full bench also observed that proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act could not be transferred to the Family Courts since these courts only had additional jurisdiction to deal with such matters. The court added that an aggrieved person could file an appeal in the Sessions Court and then approach the High Court in further appeal under Article 227 but not under Section 482 of CrPC. The full court further clarified that the order shall be applicable only prospectively. Therefore, those cases where the matter was already transferred to the Family Court need not be interfered with at this point by way of the High Court order, it added. "What has already happened, let it be. Why should we open a Pandora's Box. Since these disputes are matrimonial in nature, it will further prolong the agony of the parties if it is transferred from one court to another," the court observed. Case Title: Arul Daniel v Suganya and other connected matters Case No: Crl OP 31852 of 2022   
The Bombay High Court has ruled that the arbitrator cannot be said to have committed a jurisdictional error by allowing a consolidated Statement of Claims (SoC), without the consent of the opposite party/ award debtor, in view of the fact that specific claims pertaining to each of the nine contracts were placed distinctly in the Statement of Claims and the award debtor also chose to file a consolidated counter claim pertaining to all the nine contracts.  While dismissing the challenge to the arbitral award on the ground that the arbitrator had no power and jurisdiction to consolidate the disputes, the bench of Justice Manish Pitale observed that the nine contracts were executed between the same parties, consisting of identical arbitration clauses, and the nature of the dispute arising from the said contracts was also identical.  The petitioner, BST Textile Mills Pvt Ltd, entered into nine contracts, each containing an arbitration clause, for purchasing certain goods from the respondent, the Cotton Corporation of India Ltd, a Government of India undertaking.  Alleging that the petitioner had committed breach of the said contracts, the respondent- Corporation issued a notice to the petitioner invoking the arbitration clause and the dispute was referred for arbitration.  Before the Arbitral Tribunal, the respondent-Corporation filed a single statement of claim pertaining to the disputes that arose from all the nine contracts executed between the parties. The petitioner, BST Textile Mills, apart from disputing the claims on merit, raised an objecting against the consolidation of the claims.  The Arbitral Tribunal, however, allowed the single statement of claim filed by the respondent-Corporation/ claimant, and an arbitral award was passed in favour of the respondent.  Challenging the arbitral award, the petitioner, BST Textile Mills, filed a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) before the Bombay High Court.  The petitioner, BST Textile Mills, submitted before the Court that the arbitrator had no power and jurisdiction to consolidate the disputes arising out of the independent and distinct nine contracts. In the absence of such power to consolidate, particularly when the petitioner had not consented to such consolidation, the arbitral award was vitiated and opposed to the fundamental policy of Indian Law, it argued.  BST Textile Mills added that under the nine contracts, the respondent-Corporation was supposed to supply cotton bales from three different branches. As the causes of action were separate and distinct, pertaining to each independent contract, the claims pertaining to each such dispute or cause of action ought to have been separate and distinct, it claimed.  The respondent/ claimant, Cotton Corporation of India, averred that the terms of the contract, the format and the mutual obligations recorded in all the nine contracts, were identical.  Referring to the facts of the case, the Court observed that the nine contracts were executed between the same parties, consisting of identical arbitration clauses and the only difference in the contract was with regard to the actual figures of sale and purchase.   Further, it took note that the petitioner also filed a single counter claim in respect of the reliefs claimed by the respondent/ claimant under all the nine contracts.  Noting that the nature of the dispute arising from the nine contracts was identical, the bench further reckoned that the Arbitrator, while dismissing the petitioner’s objection, cannot be said to have erred in observing that the petitioner had also raised a composite counter claim.  “This Court is of the opinion that when specific claims pertaining to each of the nine contracts were placed distinctly in the statement of claim filed on behalf of the respondent, to which the petitioner had ample opportunity to respond and the fact that the petitioner also chose to file a consolidated counter claim pertaining to all the nine contracts, it cannot be said that the learned arbitrator committed a jurisdictional error in proceeding with the arbitration,” the Court said.  The petitioner, BST Textile Mills, submitted before the Court that prejudice was caused to it when the arbitrator chose to proceed with a consolidated statement of claims since separate and distinct, alleged acts of breach of contracts, were not taken into consideration.  Rejecting the arguments of the petitioner, the bench remarked, “This Court is not impressed with the said contention, primarily for the reason that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, distinct claims arising out of all the nine separate contracts were set out by the respondent. Evidence was specifically led in respect thereof, in the context of which, the petitioner had ample opportunity to cross examine the witnesses and to lead its own evidence. The counter claims were also raised in a consolidated manner by the petitioner, thereby indicating that it was in the interest of justice that the learned arbitrator chose to proceed in the said manner. Therefore, the principal contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is found to be without any substance.”  The bench further held that in proceedings under Section 34 of the A&C Act, the Court cannot reappreciate evidence since the quantity and quality of evidence is within the domain of the arbitrator. Holding that the interpretation placed on the terms of a contract is also within the domain of the arbitrator, the Court said that even if any term is erroneously interpreted by the arbitrator, it does not give rise to a sufficient ground to exercise jurisdiction under Section 34.   The Court thus dismissed the petition.

The Uttarakhand High Court recently directed the State Government to pay a compensation amount of ₹35 Lakh to an acid attack survivor.   Justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra said a sum of Rs. 35 Lakh would be just, proper and adequate compensation to the petitioner in addition to the amount already paid to her. The court also said she should be given some vocational training if she is willing to undertake.  "In addition to the aforesaid amount of compensation and vocational training, the State Government shall also provide free medical treatment to the petitioner, as it is also brought to our notice that petitioner has to undergo further surgeries, which require skin grafting. In case, hospitals situated and operating in the State of Uttarakhand, do not have proper technology, equipments or doctors to carry out the surgeries that is require to be meted out to her, then the State of Uttarakhand shall be under an obligation to get her treated in any hospital at New Delhi or in PGI, Chandigarh" The court said entire expenses of the petitioner for operation, travelling and stay shall be borne by Uttarakhand government.   "Travelling and stay expenses of an attendant of petitioner shall also be borne by the State. The Member Secretary, UKSLSA [Uttarakhand State Legal Service Authority] is directed to release and transfer a sum of Rs. 35 Lakh in her name through RTGS/NEFT after expiry of the limitation for filling the intra court appeal," it added. The court passed the directions on the petition filed by a woman, who was attacked with acid in 2014. She suffered 60% burn injuries on her upper body and knee and she also lost her right ear due to the attack. The accused was later convicted.  The petitioner was represented by Advocate Snigdha Tiwari in the plea filed in 2019. The victim was paid a compensation of Rs 1,60,000 in compliance of order passed by Criminal Injury Compensation Board under the Uttarakhand Victim from Crime Assistance Scheme, 2013. In September 2019, an additional compensation of Rs. 1,50,000 was granted to her on orders of the court.. The State submitted that since the petitioner was already paid the compensation by the DLSA, she could have appealed the same before Uttarakhand State Legal Service Authority. Contending that the petition was not maintainable in view of availability of "efficacious alternative remedy" to her, the State argued that she should be given compensation under the old scheme and not the new scheme which was implemented in 2018, since the attack dated back to 2014.  Justice Mishra, however, rejected the arguments of the State.  Relying on the Supreme Court decision in Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, (1998) 8 SCC 1, the Court said:  "The powers of High Court for issuing writs under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is very wide. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case has held that a writ petition is maintainable without relegating the poor litigant to avail alternative efficacious remedies. Even if, efficacious alternative remedy is available, if there is breach of fundamental right; or if there is violation of principle of natural justice and if order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged, the High Court has power to entertain the writ petition."  On the question of applicability of the new scheme, the Court said that although the incident took place on 29.11.2014 much before 2018, the process of determination of compensation still continues and the effects of acid are still alive as the victim had to undergo so many reconstructive surgeries of face, reconstruction of right ear and other medical procedures and treatment. "In this case, the Court takes into consideration that there is a breach of fundamental right of the victim petitioner, who is acid attack survivor. The right to live life with dignity has been breached in this case," said the court. Case Title: Gulnaaz Khan v. State of Uttarakhand and Others  Coram: Justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra      
The Allahabad High Court last week upheld the conviction of a man under Section 304 of the IPC who was sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment under Section 304 (II) of the IPC for committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the year 1981.Stressing that relationship is not a factor to affect credibility of a witnes, the bench of Justice Vikram D.

The Allahabad High Court last week upheld the conviction of a man under Section 304 of the IPC who was sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment under Section 304 (II) of the IPC for committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the year 1981. Stressing that relationship is not a factor to affect credibility of a witnes, the bench of Justice Vikram D. Chauhan observed that mere statement that being relatives of the deceased they are likely to falsely implicate the accused cannot be a ground to discard the evidence which is otherwise cogent and credible.  "Merely because the witnesses are family members their evidence cannot per se be discarded. When there is allegation of interestedness, the same has to be established...It is more often than not that a relation would not conceal actual culprit and make allegations against an innocent person. Foundation has to be laid if plea of false implication is made. There is no bar in law on examining family members as witness. Evidence of a related witness can be relied upon provided it is trustworthy," the Court further remarked. The case in brief In the instant case, Accused Kanta was held guilty by the Special and Additional Sessions Judge, Ghazipur of assaulting the deceased (Laxmi Shankar) with a Faruhi. Essentially, there was an altercation between the accused and the complainant and when the accused took 'Faruhi' in his hand to assault the complainant, the deceased came in between them to save the complainant and as such 'Faruhi' hit the deceased on his head. The deceased on being hit on the head fell down and was taken to the Doctor who gave him first aid and thereafter he was talking normally and as such the complainant thought that he was out of danger and did not take him to hospital, however, at about 11:00 p.m. Laxmi Shankar died on account of injury.  Before the Court, it was argued by the appellant that there was no independent witness of the alleged occurrence and since the Prosecution Witness was the relative of the deceased, htherefore, there being no independent witness of the alleged occurrence, the prosecution story is not reliable and the evidence related witness is not trustworthy and is liable to be rejected. Court's observations At the outset, the Court observed that a witness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from sources which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate him falsely.  "Ordinarily a close relative would be the last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is often the case that the offence is witnessed by a close relative of the victim, whose presence on the scene of the offence would be natural. The evidence of such a witness cannot automatically be discarded by labelling the witness as interested," the Court further remarked as it rejected the plea of the Appellant that there is no independent witness to support the prosecution case. The Court also discarded the plea of the appellant that there had been an unexplained delay in the lodging of the FIR and that the injury could have been caused by a Gandasa and not a Faruhi. With this, having found no illegality, infirmity and perversity in the impugned judgement passed by the trial court convicting and sentencing the Appellant for the offence, the High Court upheld the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court and rejected appeal of the accused. Case title - Kanta v. State of U.P. [CRIMINAL APPEAL No. - 549 of 1983]    
The Madras High Court recently observed that once FIR has been registered against a person, his/her re-examination by the investigation agency on its own should not be permitted merely by registering another FIR with regard to the same occurrence."If such protection is not given to a suspect, then possibility of abuse of investigating powers by the police cannot be ruled out. It would result... The Madras High Court recently observed that once FIR has been registered against a person, his/her re-examination by the investigation agency on its own should not be permitted merely by registering another FIR with regard to the same occurrence. "If such protection is not given to a suspect, then possibility of abuse of investigating powers by the police cannot be ruled out. It would result into a multiplicity of proceedings and unnecessary harassment to the accused and registration of multiple FIR's on the same occurrence would be hit by the doctrine of sameness and it would have to be obliterated, as it would amount to violation of fundamental rights of a citizen," the bench of Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan further remarked. The case in brief The Court was essentially dealing with a plea filed under section 482 CrPC to quash the FIR registered by the state police against the petitioner for offences under Sections 468, 471, and 420 of IPC. As per the prosecution's case, the petitioner was designated as a Secretary of one of the basic units of St.John Ambulance institution and he was working till the year 2012. He was removed from the association, however, he continued to use the Company's name by illegally creating an email ID and also by using a bank account in the name of the association.  He approached various companies, schools, colleges, etc. by using the name of M/s.St.John Ambulance Association to impart first aid training. The trainer license issued to the petitioner also lapsed in the month of February 2018 and even after the expiry of the trainer license, he conducted first-aid training through his associates. Now, one, J.K.Siva Kumar, Head-HR, M/s.Leo Prime Company Private Limited approached him for getting the first-aid certificate for 39 employees of his concern. The petitioner collected an amount of Rs.12,250/- by concealing the facts and misusing the name of St.Johns Ambulance with a view to secure illegal gain.  Subsequently, an FIR was lodged against him in the year 2015, however, the same was quashed subsequently by the High Court. Despite this, the second respondent preferred another complaint was made with the same set of allegations, and the FIR was registered.  It is the petitioner's case that he is very much eligible for organizing and conducting the said courses as he is a certified trainer and an authorized lecturer for conducting First-Aid and Home Nursing Courses with the approval of St.John Ambulance. It was also his case that when an FIR had already been registered against him, which was subsequently quashed then why subsequent FIRs had been registered on the same set of allegations? Therefore, his grievance was that the offences are same and for the very same occurrence, three FIRs have been registered as against the same accused persons. Court's observations At the outset, the Court observed that sometimes it happens that several pieces of information are given to a police officer in charge of a police station in respect of the same incident involving one or more than one cognizable offences, but in such a case, the investigation officer need not enter all such information of them in the FIR and therefore, the Court added, successive FIR's not being a counter case, filed in connection with the same or connected cognizable offence cannot be sustained and not permissible under law. With this, the Court quashed the entire proceedings in crime No.7 of 2018 registered by the police for offences under Sections 468, 471, and 420 of IPC as against the petitioner, and thus, the instant criminal original petition was allowed.  Case title - K.J.Suriyanarayanan v. State and another    
The Chhattisgarh High Court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Gautam Chourdiya has refused to grant bail to a person allegedly involved in availment of fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC).The appellants created several fictitious and physically non-existent trading company firms in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra,... The Chhattisgarh High Court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Gautam Chourdiya has refused to grant bail to a person allegedly involved in availment of fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC). The appellants created several fictitious and physically non-existent trading company firms in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra, got them registered in GSTN portal online using identity credential of several persons using forged PAN and issued fake bills to transmit fake ITC to several other traders.  It was alleged that the appellants had fraudulently shown in their GST returns to have procured several kinds of goods from within and across the State. The Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence, Raipur Zonal Unit, Raipur cracked this racket on the basis of intelligence against a taxpayer, namely, M/s Manoj Enterprises, who during the month of July, 2020 and August, 2020, claimed Rs.44.72 crores from ITC by way of trading activities even when their statutory returns did not indicate purchase of any such goods for trade.   On the basis of information gathered, the appellants were arrested for the offence under Section 132(1)(b) & (c) of the Central Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 from Raipur and produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur.  The appellants filed an application under Section 167(2) of CrPC for granting them default bail on the ground that despite the lapse of 60 days from the date of their judicial custody, no charge sheet was filed by the respondent/GST authority against them. The application was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur which was subsequently affirmed by the revisional Court and the writ petition filed against the order was also dismissed by the Single Judge.  The appellant contended that as per the Act of 2017, offence under Section 132 is a cognizable offence. There is no provision to file any complaint instead of a charge sheet. No FIR was lodged against the appellants, no investigation was conducted by the concerned police station, no charge sheet was filed against them under Section 173 of CrPC, as such, the learned Single Judge was in error in not enlarging the appellants on default bail.  The court observed that the offence allegedly committed by the appellants is an economic offence. If on further investigation any new relevant fact or document comes within the knowledge of the investigating officer, he can file the supplementary report. So far as the appellants are concerned, the material collected against them during investigation as filed with the complaint are sufficient for establishing a prima facie case against them under Section 132(1)(b) & (c) of the CGST Act of 2017 and therefore, on filing of such complaint, the Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence against them.  The court held that though the complaint filed by respondent cannot be said to have been filed under Section 173 of CrPC but for the purpose of default bail, it can be said that respondent, who is an authorised officer under the CGST Act of 2017 to carry out investigation/enqiury, filed the complaint within the prescribed time limit which satisfies the requirement under Section 167 of CrPC and as such, no right accrues to the appellants to seek default bail under Section 167(2) of CrPC. Case Title: Paritosh Kumar Singh Versus State Of Chhattisgarh  Case No.: Writ Appeal No. 348 of 2021  Dated: 22.04.2022  Counsel For Petitioner: Advocate B.P. Sharma   
The Orissa High Court has reiterated that the rules of natural justice are required to be followed before disengaging even a contractual employee. While providing relief to a junior teacher (contractual), who was removed without being provided an opportunity to defend himself, a Single Judge Bench of Justice Sashikanta Mishra said: “This Court is not impressed with the argument that being a contractual employee no rules or procedure are required to be followed before disengaging him. It is rather the settled position of law that even in case of a contractual employee the rules of natural justice are required to be followed to the hilt.” Background The petitioner was engaged as a Sikshya Sahayak by an order issued by the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parisad-cum-Collector, Jagatsinghpur in 2015. In 2018, the District Education Officer, Jagasinghpur issued a show cause notice containing certain allegations asking the petitioner to reply.  He submitted his reply within the stipulated date denying all the allegations. No further communication was made to him till issuance of the impugned notice dated 01.06.2018 by the District Project Co-ordinator, SSA, Jagatsinghpur. Being aggrieved by the notice, the petitioner filed this writ petition. Contentions of Parties It was submitted for the petitioner that as he was appointed by the orders of the CEO, Zilla Parisad-cum-Collector, Jagatsinghpur, therefore, he is also the disciplinary authority. Thus, the notices issued by the District Education Officer and District Project Co-ordinator are not tenable as both officials lack jurisdiction to take action, it was argued. It was further contended that the petitioner was never called upon to attend the so-called enquiry and he had no knowledge whatsoever regarding the same.  However, the counsel for the State defended the issuance of the impugned notice by arguing that the allegations against the petitioner were grave and serious. "He being a contractual employee, the detailed procedure prescribed for taking disciplinary action against a regular government servant is not applicable to him," the counsel said. Court’s Observations The Court said as the petitioner was appointed by the CEO, Zilla Parisad-cum-Collector, only he was the competent authority to take disciplinary action. “Any action proposed to be taken against the incumbent for any misconduct in employment has to be necessarily taken up by the CEO-cum-Collector. To such extent therefore, the District Education Officer cannot be said to have any authority to issue the show cause notice unilaterally to the petitioner,” said the bench. After perusing the counter affidavit submitted by the opposite party, the court observed that some sort of enquiry was conducted in the matter wherein, the statements of some students including their parents were obtained.  "Under whose authority and what manner such enquiry was conducted, if at all, is not forthcoming from the records," observed the court. The court said impugned notice reveals that the findings of the enquiry were relied upon and apparently formed the basis for issuing the impugned notice of disengagement. Justice Mishra outrightly rejected the argument advanced by the State that no rules or procedure were required to be followed before disengaging the petitioner, i.e. a contractual employee.  “In the instant case, as already stated, the enquiry was conducted entirely behind the back of the petitioner, inasmuch as he was not given any opportunity to participate and to have his say therein,” the court said. Accordingly, the writ petition was allowed setting aside the impugned notice. "It is however, made clear that it shall be open to the disciplinary authority to proceed against the petitioner for his alleged misconduct strictly in accordance with law. It is further made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case," Justice Mishra said. Case Title: Bichitrananda Barik v. State of Odisha & Ors. Case No.: W.P.(C) No. 10146 of 2018 Counsel for the Petitioner: Mr. J.K. Rath, Sr. Advocate, M/s. Durgesh Narayan Rath, P.K. Rout & A.K. Saa, Advocates Counsel for the Respondents: Mr. P.K.

The Madras High Court on Tuesday rejected a review application filed by Thol. Thirumavalavan, leader of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, seeking a review of the September 22nd order passed by the court granting permission to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to conduct their route march. The bench of Justice GK Ilanthiraiyan observed that the petitioner was not a party to the Writ Petitions and if he had any grievances over the order, he could very well file an appeal in the manner known to law. The grounds raised by the petitioner are applicable only to challenge the order passed by this Court and not for review, since there is no apparent error on the face of records as such the petitioner failed to make any ground to review the order passed by this Court. Considering the above facts and circumstances, this Court finds no merits in the Review Application to review the order dated 22.09.2022 passed by this Court in W.P.No.24540 of 2022 etc., batch. Hence, the present petition to grant leave to file Review application is liable to be dismissed. The petitioner apprehended that if given permission to conduct the route march, the organisation would disrupt law and order & public order. He also submitted that his party had invited general public to participate in a social harmony procession on the same day. Thus, if the respondent organisation was allowed to conduct their procession, there will be a public disruption. The petitioner also contended that the Registry had erroneously numbered the petitions as criminal when the relief sought was of civil nature.  The court relied on the decision of the Apex Court in Ram Kishan Fauji Vs. State of Haryana and ors, where the court explained what constitutes criminal proceedings includes those in which in the larger interest of the State, orders to prevent apprehended breach of the peace, orders to bind down persons who are a danger to the maintenance of peace and order or orders aimed at preventing vagrancy. Therefore, the registry was right in numbering the petitions as criminal.  The court also pointed out that just because the petitioner had also sought permission to conduct procession on the same day, it did not give him any right to seek review of the order of the court. The court noted that the present litigation was nothing but an abuse of process of law. Thus, noting that the petitioner had no locus standi and that there were no valid grounds for review, the court dismissed the petition.

The Supreme Court has reiterated that discretion to direct subsequent sentence to run concurrently with the previous sentence has to be exercised judiciously depending upon the nature of offences committed. A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice BV Nagarathna observed that in NDPS cases, even while applying discretion under Section 427 of Cr.PC, the discretion shall not be in favour of the accused who is found to be indulging in illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. "...while awarding the sentence or punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is required to be taken into consideration. Therefore, even while applying discretion under Section 427 of Cr.PC, the discretion shall not be in favour of the accused who is found to be indulging in illegal trafficking in the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances", the Court observed in the case Mohd Zahid vs State through NCB. The observations have been made by the Top Court while considering the question as to whether the sentences imposed by two different courts in two different trials but against the same accused/person should run concurrently or consecutively. The Bench was considering a special leave petition challenging Delhi High Court's order refusing to grant accused the relief and holding that sentences imposed in both the NDPS cases against him be run concurrently. In the present case, the accused was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 12 years in one case followed by a sentence of 15 years rigorous imprisonment in another case, both being offences under the NDPS Act.  Considering the same, the Bench observed that no leniency should be shown to an accused who is found to be guilty of the offence under the NDPS Act. The Bench also made strong remarks against those accused of dealing in narcotic drugs and for offences under the NDPS Act.  "Those persons who are dealing in narcotic drugs are instruments in causing death or in inflicting death blow to a number of innocent young victims who are vulnerable. Such accused causes deleterious effects and deadly impact on the society. They are hazard to the society," the Bench said. The Bench further added that, "Such organised activities of clandestine smuggling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into this country and illegal trafficking in such drugs and substances have a deadly impact on the society as a whole." According to the Bench, while awarding the sentence or punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is required to be taken into consideration. The Bench observed that considering the offences under the NDPS Act which are very serious in nature and against the society at large, no discretion shall be exercised in favour of such accused who is indulging into the offence under the NDPS Act. Summarizes Principles under Section 427 CrPC The Bench took note of the following principles of law that emerge from its previous judgements, including Mohd. Akhtar Hussain alias Ibrahim Ahmed Bhatti Vs. Assistant Collector of Customs, Ranjit Singh Vs. Union Territory of Chandigarh & Anr, V.K. Bansal Vs. State of Haryana etc:  If a person already undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction to imprisonment, such subsequent term of imprisonment would normally commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced.Ordinarily, the subsequent sentence would commence at the expiration of the first term of imprisonment unless the court directs the subsequent sentence to run concurrently with the previous sentence.The general rule is that where there are different transactions, different crime numbers and cases have been decided by the different judgments, concurrent sentence cannot be awarded under Section 427 of Cr.PC.Under Section 427 (1) of Cr.PC the Court has the power and discretion to issue a direction that all the subsequent sentences run concurrently with the previous sentence, however discretion has to be exercised judiciously and there must be a specific direction. Background:  In the present case, the accused has been convicted by two different courts in two different trials for the offences under the NDPS Act with respect to the different transactions. For having in possession of 4 kg of heroin, accused was sentenced to undergo 12 years rigorous imprisonment for the offence under Section 23 and Section 21 of the NDPS Act by Amritsar CourtIn another case for having 750 grams of heroin accused was sentenced to undergo 15 years RI for the offence under Section 29 read with Section 21(c) of the NDPS Act by Delhi Court. The judgments were delivered in both the cases one after another and in the subsequent judgment and order of conviction and sentence by the Delhi court there was no specific order passed by the learned Trial Court at Delhi that the sentences were to run concurrently. The present special leave petition was filed before the Supreme Court against Delhi High Court's order dismissing appeal of the accused and confirming Trial Court's order convicting him for an offence under Section 29 read with Section 21(c) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and sentencing him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 15 years with a fine of Rs.1,50,000. The High Court refusing to grant accused the relief held that sentences imposed in both the NDPS cases against him be run concurrently. Case Title: Mohd Zahid vs State through NCB    
The Supreme Court has held that the applicability of a modified scheme with respect to an appointment on compassionate grounds would be based on a fixed criteria, like the date of death, rather than an indeterminate factor, like the date of consideration of the claim. A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian refused to hold that Karnataka... The Supreme Court has held that the applicability of a modified scheme with respect to an appointment on compassionate grounds would be based on a fixed criteria, like the date of death, rather than an indeterminate factor, like the date of consideration of the claim.  A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian refused to hold that Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) (7th amendment) Rules, 2012 can be applied retrospectively so as to provide, a person seeking compassionate appointment, the enhanced benefits of a new amendment. It further reiterated that compassionate appointments cannot be treated as a vested right in law. Factual Background  The respondent's sister died in harness (prior to retirement) on 08.12.2010. At the time of her death she was serving as an Assistant Teacher in a Government School. Her mother, two sisters, and two brothers, including the respondent were dependent on her income. The respondent made an application seeking appointment on compassionate grounds. The competent authority rejected the claim on 17/21.11.2012 on the ground that the Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) (7th amendment) Rules, 2012, which extended the benefit of compassionate appointment to unmarried dependant brother of an unmarried female employee came into existence on 20.06.2012, long after the respondent's sister had passed away. On denial of his claim the respondent approached the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal, which applied the amendment retrospectively and allowed the application. The State filed an appeal before the Karnataka High Court. It dismissed the appeal on the basis of the judgment passed by its Division Bench in State of Karnataka v. Akkamahadevamma and Ors., wherein Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) (57th Amendment) Rules, 2000 was applied retrospectively.  Analysis of the Supreme Court  Distinguished Akkamahadevamma's judgement The Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Akkamahadevamma (supra) interpreted the Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) (57th Amendment) Rules, 2000 to be applied retrospectively, in a context wherein the unamended Rules were held to be unconstitutional by the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal.  "In any case an amendment brought forth, on the basis of a Judgment of a Court or Tribunal, holding the exclusion of certain categories of persons to be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, may receive an interpretation such as the one proposed by the High Court in Akkamahadevamma. But the same may not be applicable to amendments of the nature that we are concerned with in this case."  Moreover, the said amendment was with respect to 'project displaced persons' and not for 'persons seeking appointment on compassionate ground'.   Date of death or Date of consideration of the claim to be applied - conflict of opinion Senior Advocate, Mr. Jayanth Muthraj appearing on behalf of the respondent argued that there are two lines of judgments of the Supreme Court with respect to appointment on compassionate ground. One line considers that the Rules as on the date of death would be applicable and another line considers that the Rules as on the date of consideration of the claim would be applicable. He apprised the Court that a Division Bench had already referred the said issue to a larger bench in State Bank of India v. Sheo Shankar Tewari (2019) 5 SCC 600 on 08.02.2019.  Referring to a catena of judgments the Court noted that, the conflict in the line of decisions was because of the interpretation that the Court resorted to depending on the nature of amendment - the amendments where the existing benefit was withdrawn or diluted and those where the existing benefit was enhanced. It observed that in cases where the amendment diluted the benefit, the Court had directed the application of the amended Rules and in cases where the amendment enhanced the existing benefit, the Court had directed the application of the unamended Rules. Elucidating the rationale behind this approach, the Bench stated -  "This is fundamentally due to the fact that compassionate appointment was always considered to be an exception to the normal method of recruitment and perhaps looked down upon with lesser compassion for the individual and greater concern for the rule of law." Considering that the fulcrum of the conflict was the two dates - date of death and date of consideration of claim, the Court observed that the date of death was a fixed factor, whereas, the date of consideration was a variable factor. The Court was of the view that applicability of a rule ought not to be interpreted to be based on a variable factor.  "There is no principle of statutory interpretation which permits a decision on the applicability of a rule, to be based upon an indeterminate or variable factor…A rule of interpretation which produces different results, depending upon what the individuals do or do not do, is inconceivable…"  Accordingly, the Court decided that the applicability of the amended rules are to be considered from the date of death rather than the date of consideration of claim.   "Therefore, we are of the considered view that the interpretation as to the applicability of a modified Scheme should depend only upon a determinate and fixed criteria such as the date of death and not an indeterminate and variable factor."  Compassionate appointments cannot be treated as a vested right in law  The Court clarified that compassionate  appointments are not vested right in law, as it is not automatic and is subjected to strict scrutiny of various parameters, such as, financial position of the family, the economic dependence of the family upon the deceased employee, the avocation of the other members of the family.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has ruled that the payment of wages at the rate of Rs. 500 per year since 1998 to a government school employee is clearly a form of Forced Labour, which is strictly prohibited under Article 23 of the Constitution of India."This Court being a custodian of the fundamental rights cannot shut its eyes to the injustice carried out against the petitioner... The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has ruled that the payment of wages at the rate of Rs. 500 per year since 1998 to a government school employee is clearly a form of Forced Labour, which is strictly prohibited under Article 23 of the Constitution of India. "This Court being a custodian of the fundamental rights cannot shut its eyes to the injustice carried out against the petitioner by an act of the State, which claims to achieve socio economic equality as the cherished dreams of the Constitution," said a single bench in an order dated September 19. The bench comprising Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal was hearing a contempt petition in which the petitioner prayed for initiating proceedings against authorities including Director School Education, Jammu for non-compliance of a September 2013 order directing the authorities to consider payment of wages as envisaged under Minimum Wages Act to the petitioner.  The court on April 20 had again directed the Director School Education to release immediately the minimum wages in terms of Minimum Wages Act in favour of the petitioner but the order was not complied with. The petitioner has been working since 28.10.1998 as Waterman-cum-Sweeper in the Government Model Middle School, Mahanpur. "This is a sheer case of exploitation to a poor person by the respondents, where the respondents are extracting the work from the petitioner since 1998 and as on date and the petitioner is being paid Rs. 500/- per year which is insufficient to cater the daily needs of the petitioner and it shocks the conscience of the Court that a person even after 72 years of independence continue to suffer exploitation," said the court.  The court said since the authorities continue to "exploit" the petitioner, they were under a legal obligation to regularise his services or should have paid him the minimum wages. It further said the Director School Education Jammu has neither complied with the court direction nor has appeared in person despite being directed to do so. "... which means that he is taking the Court order casually and and instead he has filed an application for seeking exemption which is declined keeping in view his conduct," said the bench, adding it was a fit case where proceedings can be initiated against the officer as he was in a recurring contempt. The court granted the officer final opportunity to comply with its order in letter and spirit and asked for a compliance report by September 26. "Respondent No. 2 shall appear in person along with the record of the list of contingent paid workers/local fund paid workers approved for regularization in terms of SRO-308 of 2008 of Jammu Division from 1998 till date as directed by this Court vide order dated 20.04.2022," said the court further. The bench also said the case highlights the manner in which the practice of forced labour is prevalent in country even after 72 years of independence and that helpless people similar to the petitioner continue to suffer the exploitation "willingly".  Referring to Article 23 of the Constitution, the court said: "This article is designed to protect the individual against any form of forced labour practiced by any person and has its genesis in the socio-economic conditions of the people at the time the constitution came to be enacted, with a view to ensure socio and economic justice to the large masses of people living in abject poverty, destitution and slavery."

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently held that on account of delay in the conclusion of trial, rigors of Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act can be relaxed to an extent and prayer of the accused for bail can be considered despite that she was found in possession of a commercial quantity of contraband. Section 37 bars grant of bail to persons accused of an offence punishable for offences under section 19 or section 24 or section 27A of the Act and also for offences involving commercial quantity. In the instant case, the petitioner-accused was the owner of the car from which 500 Grams of Heroin was recovered. She had been in custody since August 2019 and only three out of 32 witnesses were examined so far. It was also contended that petitioner is of the age of 37 years and her husband has already expired because of which the burden of taking care of her young children falls upon her.  "Therefore, the rigors of Section 37 of the NDPS Act can be relaxed to an extent and the prayer of the accused for grant of bail can be considered despite the fact that she has been found in possession of commercial quantity of contraband," a bench comprising Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi said. It relied on Chitta Biswas @ Subhas Vs. The State of West Bengal, Amit Singh Moni Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and judgment of this court in Vipan Sood Vs. State of Punjab & Anr. CRMM-20177-2020(O&M) where the concession of regular bail was granted by the Supreme Court in cases where the accused had undergone a substantial period of custody.  A perusal of the aforementioned judgments would show that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has also considered and granted the concession of regular bail in cases where the accused has undergone a substantial period of custody despite the rigors of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the High Court noted.  Accordingly, without commenting on the merits of the case, the Court allowed her bail plea with a note of caution that if the petitioner indulges in a similar offense again, the State would be at liberty to move an application for cancellation of bail.  Case Title : Ghanso @ Kalo v. State of Punjab   
Form 16 issued by an employer for income tax purposes, showing a higher remuneration than a salary slip, is a reliable piece of evidence for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, the Bombay High Court has held.  "We find that Form 16 is a reliable piece of evidence to determine the real income of the deceased. The reason is that Form 16 has been signed and generated by the employer of the deceased," a division bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Gauri Godse observed.   "Whenever a Tribunal or a Court fixes an amount of compensation in cases of accident, it involves some guess work some hypothetical consideration and certain amount of sympathy. Thus, the Tribunal ought to have considered the entries in Form 16, which showed the total income of the deceased," the bench added.    The bench ordered Tata AIG General Insurance Co Ltd to pay deceased Vilas Ramkumar Deshpande's kin Rs. 2,78,76,708 with 8% interest within four months for an accident on the Mumbai – Agra Highway in December 2012. At the time of the accident Deshpande was 46-years-old and a Senior Manager with Ultratech Cement Limited at Mumbai.   During the accident, a vehicle rammed into the divider, crossed over to the other side of the road and hit Deshpande's car killing him soon after. While the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal ordered compensation of Rs.1,76,08,400 in February 2018, it relied on the petitioner's salary slip and not Form 16. It observed that there could always be ups and downs in business and therefore, it wasn't right to consider income in addition to salary.  Deshpande's wife, two minor children and ailing parents approached the High Court in appeal seeking enhancement of compensation.   Advocate Shrishank Chavanke for the family submitted that the Form 16 should be considered as its an official document submitted at the time of paying IT returns. In the Form 16, apart from the basic salary, there are several other heads which increases the annual income. He relied on a letter by the employer by which his salary was revised from July, 2012 for his exceptional performance. The administrative officer of the employer was also examined.  Prabha Gupta, driving the offending vehicle didn't appear in court. However, Tata AIG resisted the claim on the ground that the letter didn't disclose that Deshpande was entitled to the same perks every year, therefore the tribunal rightly relied on the salary slip.  At the outset the court held that Form 16 was a reliable piece of evidence, especially since the respondents were unable to demonstrated anything to the contrary. The tribunal finding that there were always ups and downs in the progress of business and therefore it would not be proper to consider the income of the deceased which was in addition to the salary, is not acceptable, the bench added.  "The Tribunal has erred in taking into consideration only the income as shown in the salary slip. As stated hereinabove, evidence and documents produced on record shows that over and above the basic salary, the deceased was also entitled to an additional remuneration on account of his performance. Evidence on record also shows that the performance of the deceased was exceedingly well and thus there is no reason to disbelieve that the deceased would have been always entitled to additional remuneration. Thus, the total income of the deceased shown in Form 16 can be attributed to his earnings."  But since this letter did not have the revised "cost to company," figures of income as reflected in Form 16 would be taken into consideration. The court noted that the appellant's calculations were accurate based on the guidelines in National Insurance Company Limited v Pranay Sethi.   As stated hereinabove, evidence and documents produced on record shows that over and above the basic salary, the deceased was also entitled to an additional remuneration on account of his performance.

Observing that a busy actress's work commitments don't make her unsuitable for her child's custody, the Bombay High Court has ruled that a minor's 'welfare' cannot be decided solely on which parent has more free time. A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar dismissed the husband's habeas corpus petition under Article 226 for custody of their minor son. However, the... Observing that a busy actress's work commitments don't make her unsuitable for her child's custody, the Bombay High Court has ruled that a minor's 'welfare' cannot be decided solely on which parent has more free time.  A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar dismissed the husband's habeas corpus petition under Article 226 for custody of their minor son. However, the court allowed him visitation rights.  The man claimed his estranged wife is an "extremely busy actress," and not in a position to devote time and efforts for their child's sound upbringing. Conversely, he had decided not to undertake any professional commitment.  "In our view, the issue of welfare of the minor cannot be determined on the sole parameter of the work commitment of one parent and availability of ample time with another. The fact that respondent No.2(mother) is a busy actress, cannot be construed to unfavourably judge her suitability to have the custody of Master R," the court held.  Background  The now-estranged couple was married in 2013, and their son was born in 2016. The husband claimed that he was asked to leave the house after a marital dispute. As a result, his son was illegally kept away from him by the mother; therefore, he should immediately be given the child's custody.  The wife argued that she was working to support herself and her children and sought dismissal of the petition as not maintainable. She, in turn, made allegations against the husband.  "In the light of the material on record, we are of the view that there are no exceptional circumstances which would warrant a departure from "tender years rule," Nor there is such material which prima-facie indicates that the custody with respondent No.2(mother) is detrimental to the welfare and development of Master R," the court observed.  Tender Years Rule - According to Section 6 under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, the father is the first natural guardian followed by the mother. However, in the case of minors below five, custody shall ordinarily lie with the mother.  Significantly, the court held that a writ of habeas corpus can be filed to grant a child's custody from one parent to the other if necessary for the child's welfare.  The court rejected the wife's counsel's argument on the habeas corpus petition being untenable once the mother produced the child before the bench via video conferencing.  "Undoubtedly, the court has to ascertain whether the custody of the child, in the circumstances of the given case, can be said to be unlawful or illegal. However, the matter does not rest at that point. The writ of habeas corpus can very well be pressed into service for granting the custody of a child to a spouse if the welfare of the child so dictates."  As a temporary arrangement, the court allowed the father a half-hour video call with the child each day and a physical meeting for two hours twice a week.  "Love and affection of both the parents are considered to be the basic human right of a child. Thus, the element of the access of the child to a non-custodial parent assumes critical salience."  Lastly, the court clarified that the parties could file appropriate proceedings for the child's custody, as the present plea was decided in writ jurisdiction. And allegations about the mother's work commitments creating a hindrance in the child's overall development could be decided through those proceedings.  "Before parting, we hope and trust that the petitioner and respondent no.2, who claim to be adept at playing characters, in reel life, act in the best interest of Master R, in real life. "

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Gwalior Bench recently quashed the FIR filed by a wife against her in-laws under Section 498-A IPC, observing that the same was filed 'to wreak vengeance' and 'with a revengeful intent in order to pressurize and harass' her in-laws.  Justice R.K. Shrivastava was dealing with an application under Section 482 CrPC moved by the Applicants seeking directions of the Court to quash the FIR registered against them for offences punishable under Section 498A, 506, 34 IPC and the consequential criminal proceedings against them.  As per the Applicants, the Respondent was a quarrelsome woman who could not adjust with the family of the Applicants after marriage. Resultantly, the Applicant/husband had filed an application for divorce. The father-in-law of the Respondent had also filed a complaint against the her for offences under Section 406, 504 IPC, prior to the registration of the impugned FIR. Therefore, in order to seek revenge against the Applicants, the Respondent got the FIR registered against them and therefore, the Applicants asserted, the same being without substance was liable to be quashed. To strengthen their contentions, the Applicants relied on the observations of the Apex Court in the recently decided case of Kahkashan Kausar alias Sonam & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors. Per contra, the Respondent and the State submitted that other pending proceedings before Applicants and the Respondent were not an impediment for her to lodge the FIR for the alleged offences committed by the Applicants. They asserted that the offence under Section 498A IPC is a continuous offence and cause of action in the present case arose after the marriage of the Respondent as her in-laws were harassing her by demanding huge sum of dowry. Hence, they prayed for dismissal of the application.  Considering the submissions of the parties, documents on record and further examining the observations of the Supreme Court in relevant cases, the Court observed that the present application deserved to be allowed-  On perusal of the impugned FIR as well as the documents available on record and in the light of the judgments passed by Hon'ble Apex Court, it appears that the allegations made against petitioners are general and omnibus, therefore, they cannot be prosecuted u/S 498A of IPC…In the case at hand, earlier a petition under Section 13 of Hindu Marriage Act was filed on 13/03/2018 by husband of complainant and on 27/09/2019, a complaint was also filed by father-in-law of complainant where-after, the conciliation proceedings could not be succeeded due to difference of thoughts whatsoever between complainant and her husband. Present FIR has been lodged on 01/08/2019 by complainant is nothing, but only to wreck vengeance so also with a revengeful intent in order to pressurize and harass the petitioners. The Court further noted-  Upon consideration of entire facts and circumstances of the case coupled with the fact that respondent No.2 has left her matrimonial home voluntarily without any rhyme and it is a fault on the part of the complainant to live separately prior to filing of the impugned FIR and in absence of specific allegation of demand of dowry or harassment, the impugned FIR deserves to be quashed.  With the aforesaid observations, the Court quashed the impugned FIR against the Applicants along with the other subsequent proceedings initiated therefrom and accordingly, the application was allowed.

The Supreme Court observed that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be applied merely on basis of designation.In this case, the court had to examine the claims made by Private Secretaries (Grade-II) ("PS-II") employed in the Eastern Central Railways (Field Office/Zonal Railways),for parity in pay with their counterparts working in the Central Secretariat Stenographers... The Supreme Court observed that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be applied merely on basis of designation. In this case, the court had to examine the claims made by Private Secretaries (Grade-II) ("PS-II") employed in the Eastern Central Railways (Field Office/Zonal Railways),for parity in pay with their counterparts working in the Central Secretariat Stenographers Service ("CSSS")/Railway Board Secretariat Stenographers Service ("RBSSS")/Central Administrative Tribunal ("CAT"). Interpreting the Sixth Central Pay Commission report, the court noticed that the aspect of disparity between the Secretariat and the field offices was a matter taken note of by the Commission itself while making the recommendations. "Yet to some extent, a separate recommendation was made qua Secretariat Organizations and non-Secretariat Organizations. Once these recommendations are separately made, to direct absolute parity would be to make the separate recommendations qua non-Secretariat Organizations otiose. If one may say, there would have been no requirement to make these separate recommendations if everyone was to be treated on parity on every aspect", the court observed. One of the contentions raised was that as a result of parity being given up to the level of Assistant (which would put them in the grade of Rs.4200 (later Rs.4600)), they, being one post higher, would automatically have to get one higher grade. The bench rejected the contention noticing that the report stipulated that parity would need to be absolute till the grade of Assistant and beyond that "it may not be possible or even justified to grant complete parity because the hierarchy and career progression will need to be different taking in view the functional considerations and relativities across the board." "We are fortified in the view we are seeking to adopt in interpreting the aforesaid paragraphs of the Pay Commission by the observations in Union of India v. Tarit Ranjan Das,  where it was opined that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be applied merely on basis of designation. While dealing with the 5th Pay Commission recommendations with respect to functional requirements, it was held that there was no question of any equivalence on that basis. The said case dealt with Stenographers of the Geological Survey of India. While observing that as a general statement it was correct to state that the basic nature of work of a Stenographer remained by and large the same whether they were working for an officer in the Secretariat or for an officer in a subordinate office; it was held that Courts ought not to interfere if the Commission itself had considered all aspects and after due consideration opined that absolute equality ought not to be given", the court said.      
The High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh on Thursday ruled that an employer cannot impose such conditions of employment which have the effect of taking away the right of its employees to seek judicial review of the actions of the employer.

The High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh on Thursday ruled that an employer cannot impose such conditions of employment which have the effect of taking away the right of its employees to seek judicial review of the actions of the employer.  The court held that the right to seek judicial review is a vital right conferred by the Constitution and any terms and conditions of employment, which restrain a person to seek legal remedies for enforcement of his rights, are null and void.  The court passed the observations in two petitions filed by the casual labourers challenging the order of Area Manager, Food Corporation of India (FCI) issued in November, 24, 2016 wherein the petitioners along with proforma respondents had been accorded temporary status, subject to certain terms and conditions laid down in the order. The petitioners were given the temporary status which entitled them to have the minimum pay scale of regular class IV employees working in FCI including DA, HRA, Lunch, subsidy and conveyance allowance on par with regular class IV employees of FCI.  The petitioners had challenged the said order of FCI whereby the casual workers including the petitioners, who were conferred temporary status shall not be brought on permanent payroll and shall not become employees of the FCI unless policy of regularization or permanent absorption is issued by the FCI in future on the ground that it took away their right of seeking a judicial review.  In their plea before the court, the petitioners also claimed that they were entitled to be brought on permanent establishment in the same manner in which similarly situated petitioners in another petition had been regularized and brought on the permanent establishment of Food Corporation of India.  Perusing the material on record the bench noted that the condition No.(iii) in the impugned order, debarring the petitioners and other beneficiaries of order from taking recourse to litigation for seeking their regularization and arrears etc., is not sustainable in law. The bench recorded that one of the conditions i.e condition No. (iii) of the order, is bad in the eyes of law and the same shall be deemed to have been deleted from the said order, the bench underscored.  "Otherwise also, the aforesaid condition has outlived its utility and has not been pressed into service by the respondent-FCI to deny the petitioners any right, nor shall the petitioners be liable for any action for filing the instant petitions or in future to enforce their rights in breach of offending clause i.e condition No.(iii) of the impugned order," the court said.  While declining any intervention, the court noted that the petitioners approached the court after the gap of five years and that the petitioners along with proforma respondents got the benefits envisaged under the impugned order and worked in that capacity for almost five years without any objection or demur.  "The petitioners have not been able to bring to my notice any representation or protest petition filed by them against the impugned order," the court said.  It was only in the year 2021, the petitioners and proforma respondents woke up from the slumber and issued a legal notice through their counsel to the FCI on July 26, 2021. "This notice was obviously issued as a run up to the filing of instant petition and to come out of the delay and laches," the bench recorded.  However court in its judgement also observed that it "hopes and trusts" that the Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) will, sooner than later, come up with appropriate policy of regularization "to erase the scars that are left after healing of wounds (grant of temporary status) of the petitioners".  Parting ways Justice Sanjeev Kumar further observed that this court is sure that the respondent- Corporation (PSU), being a model employer, is alive to its duty towards its employees particularly those working at the lowest rung and "would not indulge in any labour practice which is unfair and is tantamount to exploitation."

The Karnataka High Court has said that if a party, opposing the proceedings instituted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, fails to raise the ground of delay in filing the complaint before the court of first instance, the Court in Appeal is empowered to remand the matter back for fresh consideration on the issue of condonation of delay under Section 142(b) of the... The Karnataka High Court has said that if a party, opposing the proceedings instituted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, fails to raise the ground of delay in filing the complaint before the court of first instance, the Court in Appeal is empowered to remand the matter back for fresh consideration on the issue of condonation of delay under Section 142(b) of the Act.  A single judge bench of Justice H P Sandesh said, "In the case on hand also this is a peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and no such contention was taken before the Trial Court by the petitioners (accused under Section 138 NI Act) and if they had raised the issue of delay before the Trial Court, the complainant ought to have been given an opportunity to make necessary application to condone the delay and admittedly for the first time, the issue has been raised before the Appellate Court. Only on the ground that there is a delay, the complaint of the complainant cannot be thrown to the dustbin."  Case Background:  The petitioners M/S. A. Seating and others filed the revision petition praying before the High Court to set aside the judgment of Trial Court in convicting the petitioners herein for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and to set aside the judgment of the Appellate Court remanding the case to the Trial Court.  Complainant was running an industry in the name of M/s. Nandini Modulars. The accused gave an undertaking to the complainant that he will discharge the amount of Rs.13,58,921/- within 15 days and also issued four cheques as security to the said loan amount in favour of the complainant. On presentation of those cheques, the same were dishonoured with an endorsement as 'funds insufficient'.  A complaint was filed and cognizance was taken and the petitioners were secured and they did not plead guilty. The Trial Court after considering both the oral and documentary evidence, convicted the petitioners herein.  In appeal the accused raised a contention that the complaint is barred by limitation and there is no application filed before the Trial Court and very initiation of the proceeding against the petitioners is erroneous. The appellate court remanded the matter to consider the same afresh by giving an opportunity to the(b) complainant to file necessary application for condonation of delay and directed the Trial Court to decide the application first and thereafter proceed with the matter as per law relying upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Pawan Kumar Ralli and consequently, set aside the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court  Petitioners submissions:  It was contended, "There was a delay of seven days in filing the complaint and the Appellate Court wrongly observed that ground of delay was not raised at all before the Trial Court. Further, the Appellate Court has no power under the Cr.P.C to remand the case to the Trial Court for the purpose of giving an opportunity to the complainant to file a condonation of delay application. by filing the complaint itself, the delay application ought to have been filed and the same is not filed and the question of giving an opportunity does not arise.  Complainant opposed the plea:  The counsel argued, "Since for the first time, the petitioner had raised the objection with regard to the delay in filing the complaint. Hence, the Appellate Court considering the said application comes to the conclusion that deciding such an application is within the exclusive domain of the Magistrate to exercise his discretion to condone the delay and not the Appellate Court and also comes to the conclusion that the Appellate Court cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the Trial Court.  Further, it directed the complainant to prefer an application under Section 142(b) of the N.I. Act before the Trial Court and the Trial Court after taking objections from the petitioners herein shall decide the application first and then proceed in accordance with law.  Court findings:  The bench went through the order of the appellate court and said, "For the first time, the issue of delay is raised before the Appellate Court."  Further it said ,"If such defence was taken before the Trial Court as directed by this Court in the case of G. Thimmappa (supra), ought to have filed an application for condonation of delay. It is further observed that if delay is noticed, the Trial Court can even call upon the complainant to file an application for condonation of delay. No circumstances was arisen before the Trial Court."  It added,  "An amendment was brought in the year 2003 to Section 142 and clause (b) was inserted keeping in mind the reasons and objects of the Act and to obviate the complainant of the hardship. The Court has to take note of the wisdom of the legislature in bringing such an amendment and when the issue is raised for the first time in the appeal, the Court has to take note of all these factors into consideration."  Then the court observed ,When the issue of limitation is raised before the Appellate Court, immediately the complainant has filed an application before the Appellate Court for condonation of delay and the Appellate Court comes to the conclusion that the delay cannot be considered in Appellate Court usurping the powers of the Trial Court and the same has to be dealt with by the Trial Court.  It added, "The Court (appellate) has to take note of the very proviso of Section 142(b) of the N.I. Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court to condone the delay i.e. original Court or otherwise the very purpose and wisdom of the parliament would be defeated."  Accordingly it dismissed the petition. It directed the trial Court to dispose of the matter within one year.  Case Title: M/S. A. SEATING & Others v. M/S.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that the High Court has the power to grant an extension of time for completion of the loan repayment under the OTS (One Time Settlement) Scheme, however, such power can't be invoked at the instance of the borrower as a matter of right. The bench of Justice M. S. Ramachandra Rao and Justice J. S. Bedi also held that it is not open for the Public Sector Banks or Private Sector Banks to decline OTS sought by a borrower, provided he/she falls within the OTS Policy being followed by the Bank. The case in brief  Petitioner Aseem Gaind and his co-applicant had been sanctioned a home loan of `2,32,00,000/- in February 2014 by Axis Bank. The Amount was to be repaid in 240 monthly installments on a floating rate of interest @ 0.25% above the base rate.  Later, a home loan (against property) was also sanctioned for`1.74 Crores in February 2014 to be repaid in 180 monthly installments on a floating rate of interest @ 1.75% above the base rate. Later on, he was not able to repay the loan and so he availed the benefit of the OTS scheme of the bank, and it was decided that he will have to pay a total OTS of 2.63 Crores, however, till October 2019, he could only deposit 96.29 Lakhs. He also sought another 6 months' time to repay to the loan as per the OTS Scheme, however, vide letter dated July 12, 2019, the respondent-Bank rejected his prayer for extension of time for repayment of the balance amount of `1.76 Crores, out of total One Time Settlement 2.36 Crores. Thereafter, the petitioner moved the Court with the instant Writ Petition or issuance of a Writ in the nature of Certiorari for quashing of the letter issued by the bank rejecting his request for a time extension for loan repayment. The petitioner also claimed that that the decision of the bank was unreasonable, harsh, and contrary to the law and decisions of the HC. Bank's stand It was contended by the Bank that it is not within the purview of the High Court to grant the relief of extension of six months period for making balance payments of OTS as per sanctioned letter dt.31.03.2018 issued by it. It was further stated that the Bank is not an instrumentality of the State in terms of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and is, therefore, not amenable to the Writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Further, it was also argued that the petitioner had an effective alternative remedy under Section 17 of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, and in view of the same, this Writ Petition cannot be entertained Court's observations At the outset, the Court observed that if the denial of the OTS by a Financial Institution is not in terms of the OTS Policy framed by it or as per guidelines framed by the Reserve Bank of India, then a Writ Petition is certainly maintainable. Further, the court dealt with the questions as to in what circumstances an OTS scheme can be extended by the High Court and observed that in the case of Anu Bhalla and Another v. District Magistrate, Pathankot and Another CWP No. 5518 of 2020, the Division Bench of the High Court had specifically held that in exercising the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the High Courts would have the jurisdiction to extend the period of settlement as originally provided for, in OTS letter, but, in this case, certain guidelines were laid down. The guidelines issued in the 2020 case could be read here. Therefore, taking note of the guidelines issued in the Anu Bhalla Case, the Court examined the facts of the instant case to see whether the petitioner falls within the guidelines framed in the case for grant of extension of time for completion of the OTS. The Court noted that the petitioner, within the period of OTS, as against 2.63Crores, paid only37,67,573/-, therefore, finding it to be a figure which is too low to be considered as payment of a substantial amount, the Court observed thus: "With such slow pace of payment, in our opinion, the petitioner cannot claim that his case would fall within the guidelines framed in the case of Anu Bhalla and Another. Admittedly, even according to the petitioner, his business has been closed since 2015. The reason for the closure of the petitioner's business is only indicated as 'unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances', and no particulars are forthcoming. Even according to the decision in the case of Anu Bhalla and Another, the borrower cannot seek an extension of time for making payment of the balance OTS amount, as a matter of right," the Court remarked as it dismissed the plea. Advocate V.K. Sachdeva appeared for the petitioner. Advocates D.K. Singal and Mukund Gupta appeared for the respondent-bank. Case title - ASEEM GAIND v. AXIS BANK, RETAIL ASSETS CENTRE    
The Gujarat High Court has refused to quash a FIR registered against former Assistant Solicitor General and Senior Advocate IH Syed for alleged assault and extortion, stating that the investigation is underway and thus, it is too early to opine on his innocence. "If the allegations found to be true, it is a very serious matter as being an advocate and that too, a designated senior advocate is expected to be an upright and he is supposed to know the law. Therefore, at this stage, no interference of this Court in exercising the powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is called for and the Investigating Agency cannot be restrained in performing the statutory duties under the relevant provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure," Justice Samir Dave said. The Bench of also held that the Investigating Officer must be given reasonable time to investigate the allegations and merely because the Petitioner was a Senior Advocate was no ground to prohibit the investigation.  The Bench was hearing a criminal miscellaneous application under Section 482 for quashing of FIR for offences under sections 387, 389, 120B, 143, 147, 149, 323, 504, 506(2) and 342 of Indian Penal Code.  The Bench noted that prior to the instant FIR, another FIR was registered against the present Complainant, which was quashed on account of a settlement between the parties. However, it was alleged by the Complainant that all accused persons had forced him to sign certain papers against his will. Syed was also arraigned as an accused in the matter.  Syed primarily contented that he was innocent, and he had been falsely implicated in the case. He also submitted that the allegations made in the FIR were 'absurd' and 'inherently improbable' and that the criminal proceeding was instituted with an 'ulterior motive' to 'malign his reputation.'  Per contra, the APP submitted that the FIR discloses commission of cognizable offence and hence, the Court should not interfere under Section 482 of CrPC. It was also informed that the Petitioner was also not cooperating with the investigation.  Observing that the allegations were serious in nature and required investigation by the agency, the High Court concluded that the Petitioner had 'rushed' to the Court and that the Investigating Officer required time to investigate the allegations. The Court also expressed concern at the gravity of offences allegedly committed by an advocate who is 'supposed to know the law.'  Reliance was placed on Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors. 2021 (19) SCC 401 to explain where the FIR can be quashed:    Where the allegations do not constitute any prima facie offence against the Accused person. Where the allegations do not disclose a cognizable offence justifying an investigation under Section 156(1) of CrPC. Where the allegations made in the FIR and the evidence in support of the same, do not disclose the commission of any offence. Where the allegations do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only non-cognizable offences and no investigation was permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as under Section 155(2) of CrPC. Where the allegations made in the FIR are absurd or inherently improbable on the basis of which there is no just reason to proceed against the accused. Where there is an express legal bar in the provisions of the Code or relevant Act which redresses the grievance of the aggrieved party. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused.    In view of the above, the High Court declined to quash the FIR and observed thus: "Submissions made on behalf of the petitioner that he is an innocent and/or he has not committed any offence alleged is premature and too early to opine on the same without permitting the Investigating Agency to investigate the allegations made in the FIR...High Courts cannot invoke jurisdiction under section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash proceedings unless no offence is made out on plain reading of the allegations in the FIR as they stand." The Bench also denied Syed interim relief and dismissed the plea.  Case Title: IQBAL HASANALI SYED v/s STATE OF GUJARAT   
The Kerala High Court on Wednesday held that it is the duty of courts to protect and safeguard the properties of religious and charitable institutions from wrongful claims or misappropriation. Observing so, a Division Bench of Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P.G Ajithkumar withdrew the permission granted by the Travancore Devaswom Board to a Delhi-based trust to organise... The Kerala High Court on Wednesday held that it is the duty of courts to protect and safeguard the properties of religious and charitable institutions from wrongful claims or misappropriation.  Observing so, a Division Bench of Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P.G Ajithkumar withdrew the permission granted by the Travancore Devaswom Board to a Delhi-based trust to organise a nine-day-long 'Ramakatha' recital programme at Pamba area, encroaching upon the pilgrimage path to the Sabarimala temple. "Instances are many where persons entrusted with the duty of managing and safeguarding the properties of temples, deities and Devaswom Boards have usurped and misappropriated such properties by setting up false claims of ownership or tenancy, or adverse possession. This is possible only with the passive or active collusion of the authorities concerned. Such acts of 'fences eating the crops' should be dealt with sternly. The Government, members or trustees of boards/trusts, and devotees should be vigilant to prevent any such usurpation or encroachment. It is also the duty of courts to protect and safeguard the properties of religious and charitable institutions from wrongful claims or misappropriation." The developments ensued in a suo motu case initiated by the Court against the issue of the constructions in the Pamba area which was reported in a Malayalam daily, Mathrubhumi.  The news article had stated that the Travancore Board had leased out the said area to Shri Nandkishore Bajoria Charitable Trust to conduct a programme called "Ramkatha" by Morari Bapu, a spiritual Guru and exponent of 'Ramacharithamanasam'. The trust insisted on conducting the recital at this spot citing religious significance of the same.  The trust had sought permission to use the space for setting up tents, parking space, to telecast the event and even for a use of helipad at Nilakkal and proposed the Board ₹7 lakh as offerings, out of which ₹3 lakh was already paid. Upon the Board granting permission, the trust began constructions at the space. Senior Government Pleader S. Rajmohan argued that the land at Pamba was leased out to the Board for the specific purpose of pilgrim support which cannot be used for any other purpose, including the Ramkatha programme. The Court found merit in this contention after perusing the Travancore-Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act, 1950 and the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965. Further, reliance was placed on the Supreme Court decision in A.A. Gopalakrishnan v. Cochin Devaswom Board to reiterate that the properties of deities, temples and Devaswom Boards are required to be protected and safeguarded by their trustees, archakas, shebaits or employees.  In this decision, it was also emphasised that it is the duty of the courts to protect and safeguard the interest and properties of the religious and charitable institutions.  Additionally, the Bench established that the relevant principles under the Hindu law clearly show that a deity is always treated similar to that of a minor. Therefore, it was found that the High Court is the guardian of the deity and that apart from the jurisdiction under Section 103 of the Land Reforms Act, the doctrine of parens patriae will also apply in exercising its inherent jurisdiction. After going through the photographs of the ongoing construction made available for consideration, the Court observed that the a major portion of Pamba-Manalppuram was now occupied by the temporary structures, "causing obstruction and inconvenience" to the pilgrims proceeding through there to Sannidhanam at Sabarimala from February 13 for the Kumbamasa Pooja. As such, the Bench directed for the immediate removal of all such constructions. The Special Commissioner, Sabarimala was also directed to submit a report before the Court as to the measures that have to be taken to ensure that similar incidents are not repeated at Pamba Manalppuram in future. Standing Counsel for the Board G. Biju, Special Government Pleader (Forests) Nagaraj Narayanan and Amicus Curiae Advocate N. Raghuraj appeared in the matter.   
"Being close to someone in a natural or normal human relationship and forming an illicit relationship are two completely different things": Allahabad High CourtMerely stating that two people belonging to the opposite gender share a close relationship, won't amount to defamation, the Allahabad High Court observed last week while quashing a summoning order in a defamation complaint case.The Bench of Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh further observed that being close to someone in a natural or normal human relationship and forming an illicit relationship... Merely stating that two people belonging to the opposite gender share a close relationship, won't amount to defamation, the Allahabad High Court observed last week while quashing a summoning order in a defamation complaint case. The Bench of Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh further observed that being close to someone in a natural or normal human relationship and forming an illicit relationship are two completely different things. Facts of the case in brief  It was submitted before the Court that the statements that form the subject matter of allegation of defamation, was recorded in the course of a criminal investigation, wherein, the applicant before the Court was listed as a prosecution witness against the complainant Naseem (the person who filed the defamation case). Importantly, it was submitted that the applicant had only stated that the said Naseem had a close relationship with Sanyogita wife of Sompal and he had nowhere stated that Naseem had formed an illicit relationship with Sanyogita. The applicant further contended that the statement made by the witness in the course of the investigation can never constitute the offence of defamation and since the criminal case was pending on the date of institution of the present defamation complaint, therefore, the allegation of defamation may not arise at such preliminary stage. Therefore, the applicant moved to the High Court seeking quashing of summoning order issued in the 2007 defamation case.  Court's observations At the outset, the Court noted that the criminal case (wherein the alleged defamatory was made) was pending on the date of the complaint being lodged and for that reason, the application appeared to be premature. Further, without expressing any definite opinion if the alleged defamatory statement would constitute the offence of defamation, as such statement was made during a lawful proceeding, the Court noted thus: "...the copy of the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. does appear to suggest that the applicant had only stated that the complainant Naseem had a close relationship with Sanyogita. In itself that may never be enough to constitute the offence of defamation." Lastly, the Court noted that since it was not clear as to whether any further or other imputation relied upon in the complaint was actually made, as the complainant did not bring the material on record, the Court held that it would serve no useful purpose in allowing such a vague prosecution to continue, any further. With this, the application was allowed and the summoning order was quashed. Case title - Nakli Singh v. State of U.P. and Others  Read Order  
The High Court of Gujarat has held that a third party cannot be impleaded as a party to an application for interim reliefs under Section 9 of the A&C Actunless it is a party who is claiming under a party to the arbitration agreement.  The Division Bench of Justice N.V. Anjaria and Justice Samir J.Dave has held that the remedy under the Arbitration Act is between the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party has no concern with the proceedings of Section 9 nor the said provision recognizes the inclusion of the third party, who may be independently claiming the rights against the parties to the arbitration and vice versa.  The Court held that the entire basis of granting an interim relief under Section 9 is premised on the fact that the parties have an arbitration agreement between themselves, therefore, a third party is excluded from the ambit of Section 9 relief unless the relief claimed is in respect of those who may be claiming through the party to the agreement.  The Court held that if an order for interim relief under Section 9 is passed against a third party this would give rise to an anomalous situation as the award passed by the arbitrator is binding only on the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party would not be amenable to the final resolution of the disputes.  Facts  The parties are partners in a partnership firm named Blue Feathers Infracon. The firm initially had four partners out of which the two partners retired and the firm was reconstituted with the petitioner and respondent being the only remaining partners.   The firm purchased a land for the construction of residential flats. The partners obtained a loan of two crores on the said land. The Construction project could not be completed thus, a dispute arose between the parties.   Accordingly, the respondent filed an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act for interim measures against the petitioner. The petitioner filed an application under Order I Rule 10 of CPC to join a former partner of the firm and his wife as parties to the application for interim reliefs on the ground that the firm had given an unsecured loan to the wife of the former partner a part of which still remains unpaid and the respondent had himself taken legal action against her, therefore, she is a necessary party for proper adjudication of the dispute. The Commercial Court dismissed the application filed by the petitioner.   The Contention Of The Parties  The petitioner challenged the order of the Court on the following grounds:  The firm had given an unsecured loan to the wife of the former partner after his retirement and the part of the sum received from her was also adjusted in the sale consideration by the firm when the said property was purchased. A large part of the loan given to her still remains unpaid and the firm's account is required to be settled with the proposed parties.The retiring partner had not given the public notice regarding his retirement; therefore, he is liable to the third parties. The unsettled amount can be recovered from the retired partner; therefore, his presence is mandatory for the proper adjudication of the dispute. The respondent along with the retired partner committed a fraud on the investors thus his presence is required.   The respondent countered the arguments of the petitioner on the following grounds:  The application for the joinder of the former partner along with his wife is a mere dilatory practice. The proposed parties are not at all concerned with the dispute between the parties thus these are neither proper nor necessary parties.  Analysis By The Court  The Court held that a third party cannot be impleaded as a party to an application for interim reliefs under Section 9 of the A&C Act unless it is a party who is claiming under a party to the arbitration agreement.   The Court also held that the remedy under the Arbitration Act is between the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party has no concern with the proceedings of Section 9 nor the said provision recognizes the inclusion of the third party, who may be independently claiming the rights against the parties to the arbitration and vice versa.  The Court held that the entire basis of granting an interim relief under Section 9 is premised on the fact that the parties have an arbitration agreement between themselves, therefore, a third party is excluded from the ambit of Section 9 relief unless the relief claimed is in respect of those who may be claiming through the party to the agreement.  The Court held that if an order for interim relief under Section 9 is passed against a third party this would give rise to an anomalous situation as the award passed by the arbitrator is binding only on the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the third party would not be amenable to the final resolution of the disputes.   The Court held that merely because the firm had to recover some money from the proposed parties, this is not a ground to implead them in an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act. The Court held that the dispute with the proposed parties is outside the ambit of the arbitration clause, therefore, no ground is made out to allow the application. The Court also held that the proposed parties are not such parties who are claiming under any of the parties to the arbitration agreement, therefore, the Court upheld the decision of the Commercial Court and dismissed the Special Civil Application.

A bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud, MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna passed a direction in this regard in a writ petition filed by the President of the Kaushambi Apartments Resident Welfare Association under Article 32 of the Constitution, highlighting a magnitude of problems faced by Kaushambi, Ghaziabad residents. The petition highlighted several issues, ranging from haphazard traffic management to environmental pollution and unrestricted dumping of municipal solid waste. As a result, it has been submitted that the residents of the area are suffering from serious respiratory issues. There is an added concern over contaminated ground water. The bench decided to take up the problem of traffic management at the first instance. It observed that it cannot be seen as a mere law enforcement problem and a comprehensive traffic management plan was needed. "...we are categorically of the view that the problems which have confronted Kaushambi and Ghaziabad, in general,cannot be treated in a manner isolated from the wider context of the National Capital Region. This is not merely a matter which pertains to the Ghaziabad Development Authority or, for that matter, other authorities within the State of Uttar Pradesh alone. There has to be a coordinated effort on the part of the authorities within the Government of NCT of Delhi, East Delhi Municipal Corporation as well as the statutory authorities in the State of Uttar Pradesh having jurisdiction in the area", the Court observed in the order.  It has formed a committee with the following members : (i)Divisional Commissioner, Meerut; (ii)Chairperson, Ghaziabad Development Authority; (iii)Municipal Commissioner, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam; (iv)District Magistrate, Ghaziabad; (v)The Chairperson of UPSRTC; (vi)Senior Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad; (vii)Municipal Commissioner, East Delhi Municipal Corporation; (viii)A senior officer to be nominated by the Commissioner of Police; and (ix)The Transport Secretary of the Government of NCT of Delhi. The District Magistrate, Ghaziabad shall be the nodal officer of the Committee. The comprehensive traffic management plan has to be submitted within three weeks. Concerted and joint efforts by authorities needed The Court observed that unless all the authorities put their heads together and jointly agree on aconcerted effort to manage the traffic problems, a resolution would not be possible. The Court observed : "Some of these problems do not necessarily originate in Ghaziabad,such as the problem which is caused by the back-up of vehicles at toll booths.The Anand Vihar Terminal, the Court has been apprised, takes care of the need of the buses of the Delhi Transport Corporation and inter-state buses which originate and terminate at the Terminal. However, we do find that there is a total absence of adequate space for the parking of other public service vehicles including intra-state buses within Ghaziabad, as a result of which the vehicles are parked in a haphazard manner on public roads, including service roads.   Infact, we find from the photographs, which have been produced by the petitioners, that there is even a public board stipulating that the parking in the area is prohibited under the order of the NGT. Despite this, the photographs indicate that vehicles are still being parked around the same area. This problem has to be addressed by proper management of traffic and creating adequate space for parking of public service vehicles. Merely treating it as a matter of law enforcement will not provide a long lasting solution. Ad hoc reactions to a deeper malaise will bring no relief to the residents, users of public transport and those providing public transport". The Court noted that the National Green Tribunal had earlier passed a slew of directions for the resolution of problems affecting the area. However, the situation at the ground level has not changed substantially.  "Merely treating the matter as a law enforcement issue, particularly in the area of traffic management, will not solve the problem. Experience shows that a direction by the Court to the law enforcement machinery may result in some action, even high-handed action for a few days, until the position is restored to the original status which becomes the new "normal". Hence, a comprehensive traffic management plan has to be drawn up to deal with the situation. This will be in addition to the directions issued by the NGT and will not detract from them or from the supervision by the NGT", the Court added. Grievances of the petitioners Advocate Gaurav Goel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submitted that the residents are suffering as a result of: (i)Haphazard parking of three wheelers and other vehicles on public roads,including service roads; (ii)The absence of adequate spaces for the parking of public service vehicles; (iii)The pollution which is generated by buses plied by the Uttar Pradesh StateRoad Transport Corporation1; (iv)Use of pressure horns by vehicles; and(v)The total absence of implementation by the law enforcement machinery which causes a serious hardship to pedestrians and residents of the area. Senior Advocate Gharima Prasad, appearing on behalf of the UPSRTC, submitted that UPSRTC had acquired about nine acres of land for the setting up of a bus station. However, it appears that the front portion of the land was allotted in the recent past for the development of a mall. In the counter affidavit, it is stated that there is sufficient space for parking of buses and the existing available space within the area of nine acres is used for the purpose of parking and a workshop has also been set up for the purpose of maintenance. It has been stated in the counter affidavit and reiterated in the submissions that UPSRTC has 134 CNG buses which ply in Delhi-NCR and Ghaziabad region and as a matter of policy, an effort is being made to increase the number of CNG vehicles.

Stressing that cruelty is one of the factors in deciding on bails, the Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that ordinarily, once the courts form a prima facie opinion that the accused acted with cruelty, then such an accused should not be granted bail. Underscoring that a cruel person is more likely to create a lot of insecurity in any society, the Bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara observed thus: "Once the courts form a prima facie opinion that the accused acted with cruelty, then such an accused ordinarily should not be granted bail, and if the courts deem it appropriate to grant, then it must be after specifying the reasons for such an indulgence." The Court observed this while dealing with the bail plea of one Manish Singh booked under Sections 307, 323, 379, 397, 452, 511 & 34 of Indian Penal Code on severely assaulting a middle-aged man.  On Mar 17, 2020, the complainant/wife informed the police that her husband went up to check the same after hearing noises from the roof. There, he saw two boys stealing copper wires.  On being confronted, they hit her husband, and he got severe injuries and was hospitalized. Allegedly, the accused gave multiple blows to the face and head and penetrated a screwdriver in his eye. He remained admitted to PGI and despite the best medical care, he has lost vision from an eye and gets seizures.  The Counsel for the state referred to the medical records to establish that the victim lost his eye, skull and entire jaw had to be resurrected and had to be given food through a tube inserted through his neck. In light of these submissions, noting that the Accused/bail applicant had brutally assaulted an unarmed middle-aged person, the Court opined that an analysis of the allegations and evidence collected does not warrant the grant of bail to the petitioner. In the facts and circumstances peculiar to the case, the Court concluded that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for bail during the trial. Case title: Manish Singh @ Golu v. State of UT Chandigarh    
The Allahabad High Court has observed that a Victim/Informant under Section 372 of CrPC can't prefer an appeal against an acquittal/lesser offence/inadequate compensation order passed before December 31, 2009 (the day on which a proviso was added to Section 372 CrPC).It may be noted that the proviso to Section 372 CrPC says that a victim/informant has a right to prefer an appeal against... The Allahabad High Court has observed that a Victim/Informant under Section 372 of CrPC can't prefer an appeal against an acquittal/lesser offence/inadequate compensation order passed before December 31, 2009 (the day on which a proviso was added to Section 372 CrPC). It may be noted that the proviso to Section 372 CrPC says that a victim/informant has a right to prefer an appeal against any order passed by the court acquitting the accused or convicting for a lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation. The Bench of Justice Vivek Kumar Birla and Justice Mohd. Aslam however clarified that such an appeal can be filed only if the order in question has been passed after the enforcement of the proviso to Section 372 CrPC. The case in brief  The Court was dealing with an appeal filed by the informant, after a delay of 5173 days, against the acquittal order dated January 11, 2002, passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Deoria in under Sections 147, 148, 302, 302/149 IPC. The appeal was filed along with a delay condonation application filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. Justifying the delay, the counsel for the applicant submitted that the delay was for the reason that in the year 2002, the appellant was suffering from poor health and he could not approach his local counsel, and when he approached his counsel, then he got information that a State appeal would be filed by the State.  Thereafter, the appellant went outside of the house for earning a livelihood and when he came to Allahabad in march, 2016 for his personal work, then he got the information that the State appeal was not filed, and therefore, it was prayed that the delay in filing an appeal be condoned. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the impugned judgment is of the year 2002 and therefore, a question was to be decided as to whether an appeal can be moved against an acquittal order which had been passed way before December 31, 2009, when the proviso to Section 372 came into force. Taking into account the proviso to Section 372, the Court observed thus: "The statutory right in favor of the victim was granted by way of amendment under Section 372 CrPC w.e.f. 31.12.2009 and prior to that amendment, in State case only the State Government could have filed the appeal that too along with an application for granting leave to appeal. The appellant at the time of passing of the impugned judgment could have at the most challenged the order by filing criminal revision which right was admittedly not exercised by the appellant." Against this backdrop, the Court opined that there is no specific provision that proviso to Section 372 CrPC is retrospective in nature, and therefore, the Court added, the instant appeal would not be maintainable and accordingly, the same was dismissed as not maintainable. The Court also averred that since there was no right available to the informant after the passing of the acquittal order to move an appeal against the same, therefore, the grounds narrated in the affidavit filed in support of delay condonation application under Section 5 of Limitation Act need not be looked into.   
The Allahabad High Court last week denied anticipatory bail to a man accused of luring 90 Hindus to convert to Christianity by putting them under undue influence, coercion by playing fraud, and promise of easy money, etc.  Stressing that anticipatory bail is an extraordinary remedy to be exercised in suitable cases only, the bench of Justice Jyotsna Sharma denied the relief as it did not find any good ground to grant anticipatory bail to the accused.  The bench was essentially dealing with the anticipatory bail plea of one Bhanu Pratap Singh, booked under sections 153A, 506, 420, 467, 468, 471 I.P.C. and sections- 3/5(1) of Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020.  The case in brief  As per the prosecution case, an F.I.R. was lodged with the allegations that about 90 persons of Hindu religion have been congregated at a Church in Fatehpur for the purpose of their conversion to Christianity.  On receiving the information, the Government officers raided the plea and interrogated the pastor Vijay Massiah, who disclosed that the process for conversion was going on for the last 34 days and that this process shall be completed within 40 days.  Allegedly, the pastor also informed that they have been trying to convert even patients admitted to the Mission Hospital and the employees play an active role in the same.  The Government officers found 35 persons including the accused/applicant (named in the F.I.R.) and 20 unknown persons as having been involved in this conversion.  The accused moved the High Court arguing that he was not involved in the act and in fact, he was not present at the spot and that he has been falsely implicated in this case for ulterior motives.  It was further contended that some of the persons named in the F.I.R. viz. Madhuri Panna and Vijay Kumar Samson have been granted anticipatory bail. Hence, on the basis of parity, his application for anticipatory bail deserves to be allowed.  On the other hand, the counsel for the state contended that there was a bigger conspiracy hatched by the applicant and his associates with wider ramifications; they were acting in an organized manner for mass conversion.  It was further submitted that this is not a case where an individual was driven by his conscience to convert to a different faith but the accused persons in tandem with each other systematically went on to influence the persons who usually came in their contact for the purpose medical treatment or otherwise and their poor socio-economic condition was exploited to lure them into participating in mass conversion.   Against this backdrop, taking into account the testimonies of the eye-witnesses, and public witnesses, supporting the prosecution’s case, the Court did not find it to be a fit case to extend the relief of anticipatory bail.   Consequently, the anticipatory bail plea was rejected.  Appearances   Advocate Rajkumar Verma appeared for the bail applicant  Case title - Bhanu Pratap Singh vs. State Of U.P.

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that while denying or granting bail to a juvenile under the Juvenile Justice Act, much reliance can not be placed upon a social background or a social investigation report as they are usually prepared without proper research. "...a social background or a social investigation report may have a very limited purpose to serve. The findings cannot be solely based on such reports, which are more than often very superficial and unscientific. It is common knowledge that social investigation reports are usually prepared in printed formats without proper research. In my opinion, not much reliance can be placed on such half-baked reports," the bench of Justice Jyotsna Sharma remarked as it denied bail to a juvenile accused of committing murder while he was just over 13 years old. The Court further stressed that the Courts are under obligation to address the concerns of both sides (victim as well the juvenile in conflict with the law) while deciding upon whether or not the ends of justice shall stand defeated in case the juvenile is admitted to bail. Importantly, noting that cases of juveniles who have allegedly committed a heinous crime and are of the age of above 16 years have been treated differently from those who are found to be of the age of below 16 years in the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, however, the Court stressed, by no stretch of the imagination, it can be said that the Courts are bound to release the juvenile below the age of 16 years once he is found to be of that age and no more. "...the nature of crime, the manner of commission, the methodology applied, the mental state, the extent of involvement, the evidence available shall be the factors to be taken into account in both the types of cases where the juvenile is below 16 or where the juvenile is above 16. No artificial line can be drawn between the two categories when considering the bail from this particular angle." The case in brief As per the version of the FIR, Nitin (deceased) had gone to his college on his bullet motorcycle to receive his report card. When he approached the gate of his college, he found the revisionist (minor) and his brother standing there. He got engaged in some kind of conversation with them. Suddenly, the minor revisionist whipped out a country-made firearm and shot at Nitin. He was referred to Meerut Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries and died. On finding that the revisionist is a minor, the matter was placed before the Juvenile Justice Board, and the Juvenile was found of the age of little over 13 years and 6 months. The minor applied for bail through his guardian/father but the same was rejected by the Board. The Juvenile Justice Board, Meerut took into consideration the report of the District Probation Officer and made it a sole ground for dismissal of his bail application. Thereafter, an Appeal was filed against the bail rejection order, the same was also dismissed by the Appellate Court below. Aggrieved by the above two orders, the minor through his guardian/grandfather moved to the High Court in criminal revision. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that the gravity and heinous nature of offence becomes relevant while judging the entitlement of a juvenile to bail under the last of the three disentitling categories (explained below) under Section 12(1) of the Act.  Here, it may be noted that Sec 12 of the JJ Act clearly authorizes the Juvenile Justice Board to consider a bail plea and to release a juvenile on bail with or without surety or to place under the supervision of a Probation Officer or under the care of any fit person. This provision further states that such a Juvenile shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that the (i) release is likely to bring the Juvenile into association with any known criminal or (ii) expose the said Juvenile to moral, physical or physiological danger or his (iii) release would defeat the ends of justice. Here, it may further be noted that initially, all children below the age of 18 years were to be treated as juveniles and tried by the Board. Only after the 2015 Act came into force, a separate category for juveniles between 16 to 18 years involved in the heinous crime, was culled out, who were subjected to a preliminary assessment to ascertain if they are to be tried as a child by the Board or as an adult by the Children's Court under Section 15 of the Act. Now, the High Court, in the instant case, noted that the allegations against the Juvenile are not important and relevant while granting or denying bail, however, such allegations may assume importance when the Court has to form an opinion about the ends of justice as the Court are under an obligation to address the concerns of both the sides while deciding upon whether or not the ends of justice shall stand defeated in case the juvenile is admitted to bail. The Court further added that no useful purpose may be served by looking into the background of the offender or as to reasons and circumstances as revealed from the social investigation report, which led him to this juncture or which brought him into such a quagmire. In this regard, the Court also emphasized that the Court has to rely on its own judicial discretion and objective assessment of things while still going strictly according to the provision of law as to bail and also keeping in mind that the Act has an intertwined approach to a reformatory as well as retributive.  Regarding the instant case, the Court said that this fact can't be ignored that it was the juvenile who came prepared and armed with a country-made firearm, and though he accompanied his brother, it was he, who fired upon Nitin. The Court also noted that before the commission of the crime, he picked the firearm from his own house indicating that this incident was not committed at the spur of the moment, rather it was planned.  "The Court is, in such circumstances expected to strike a delicate balance between competing and more often than not, conflicting demands of justice where liberty of an individual is pitted against the larger interest of the society. In such cases, the need for specific supervision of the juvenile and wider need to convert the juvenile into a healthy adult by giving him professional counseling and behavioral therapy under the scheme of the Act cannot be underestimated. Moreover, it may be necessary to keep him away from the company of elements, which he previously had," the Court further remarked as it denied bail to the Juvenile in question.

The Karnataka High Court has observed that individual role of accused cannot be considered while deciding on bail application filed by a murder accused who was part of an unlawful assembly and who allegedly committed the offence in pursuance of a common object.  A single judge bench of Justice H P Sandesh made the observation while rejecting the successive bail application filed by accused Abdul Majeed who was charged under sections 143, 144, 147,  148, 341, 342, 323, 324, 364, 307, 302, 506 R/W 149 OF IPC. Earlier his bail application was rejected by the court vide order dated 01.07.2022, on merits.  Subsequently he approached the court contending that his presence was not recorded in the spot mahazar. Moreover, in the remand applications he was not named and no overt act against the petitioner is noticed as per the CCTV mahazar, except that he was present at the spot of the incident.  Further, it was claimed that he has been in judicial custody since 20.08.2021 and the case of the petitioner is similar to accused No.7, 8 and 4, who have been enlarged on bail.  The bench on going through the records noted that the seizure mahazar of the mobile is very clear that the petitioner was present along with the other assailants and the contention that the mobile video does not show his presence cannot be accepted.  It said “The material clearly discloses that this petitioner was very much present at the time of committing the murder and exchanged the words between this petitioner and other assailants with the victim.”  Then it observed “There were 26 injuries found on the dead body of the deceased and 11 injuries on the injured Vikram Singh by blunt and sharp weapons. In the case on hand, it has to be noted that CW19 eye-witness when he tried to prevent assaulting the victim, he was also taken in the car and in his presence only inflicted the injuries and committed the murder.”  Following which it held “Under such circumstances, individual role of each of the accused cannot be considered at the time of considering the bail petition in an offence punishable under Section 302 of IPC and more particularly, when they are party for the offence with Section 149 of IPC.”  In coming to the finding the bench also relied on the Supreme Court judgment in the case of KUMER SINGH VS STATE OF RAJASTHAN AND ANOTHER reported in 2021 CRL.L.J. 4244, wherein it was held that the individual role of the accused is not required to be considered when they are alleged to have been part of sharing of common intention.  Then referring to the earlier order rejecting bail application the bench said “This Court while considering the petition on merits taken note of the very presence of the petitioner as well as the eye-witness CW19 and CW19 statement was recorded on the very next date of the incident and merely not mentioning the statement of PW19 in the remand application cannot be a ground and each and everything of statement of CW19 cannot be extracted in a remand application.”  Further, the court also rejected the ground contented by the petitioner seeking bail on grounds of parity as co-accused have been released on bail. It opined “This petitioner was very much present at the time of committing the murder and also scolded the victim, and the same is evidenced in the document produced by the petitioner itself regarding seizure of mobile.”  It also turned down the contention that subsequently, improvement was made in the statement of CW19 while filing the charge-sheet by saying “The said fact is a matter of trial and prima facie material discloses against this petitioner.”  Accordingly it held “I do not find any merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner to exercise the discretion in favour of this petitioner in a successive bail petition when there is no changed circumstances.”  Case Title: Abdul Majeed And State of Karnataka   Case No: CRIMINAL PETITION NO.10830/2022  Date of Order: 16-01-2023  Appearance: Senior Advocate Hashmath Pasha for Advocate Kariappa N A for petitioner  HCGP K K Krishna Kumar for respondent.  
The Allahabad High Court recently observed that the employees of a private educational institution do not have the right to invoke the writ powers of the High Court in respect of matters relating to service where they are not governed or controlled by the statutory provisions.  The bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed thus while denying relief to the petitioner, one Devesh Verma, who was removed from the post of Lecturer in Christ Church College, Lucknow in July 1992 after he misbehaved with the college principal.  The petitioner had moved an intra-court appeal before the division bench after his plea was dismissed by Single Judge in September 2017  Relying upon Apex Court’s ruling in the case of St. Mary's Educational institute vs Rajendra Prasad Bhargava  (SC) 708, the division bench upheld the order of the single judge, passed in September 2017.  The Division bench agreed with the view taken by the single judge that a Writ Petition filed by a former teacher against the private unaided minority institution challenging the order of his termination and seeking restitution of his service, is not maintainable.  The case in brief  The Petitioner/appellant had filed the Writ Petition pleading that he was appointed as a Lecturer in Physics in the Christ Church College and he had joined his duties on October 7, 1991.   On March 31, 1992, the Principal of the College lodged an FIR under Sections 504/506 of the Indian Penal Code against him and he was arrested on July 16, 1992.   Though he was granted bail the same day, he was not allowed to resume his duties at the College.   Ultimately, in May 1996, he got acquitted in the case and after that, when he went to resume his duties at the College, he was told that another person had been appointed in his place and his services had come to an end automatically with effect from July 17, 1992, a day after his arrest.   Challenging the said oral termination of his services on the ground that before dispensing with his services, no approval was obtained under Section 16 G (3) of the U. P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921 the appellant/petitioner moved the Single Judge.  The Single judge dismissed his plea on the ground that Section 16 G (3) of the 1921 Act are not applicable to minority institutions. The Single judge also observed that the writ petition filed against a private minority institution is not maintainable.  Challenging the single judge’s order, the appellant moved the instant plea arguing that since the College is engaged in imparting education to the children, which is a public duty, therefore, the writ petition filed against such an institution would be maintainable.  Court’s observations  At the outset, the Court took into account the Apex Court’s ruling in the case of St. Mary's Educational Institute (supra), wherein it was categorically laid down that “while a body may be discharging a public function or performing a public duty and thus its actions becoming amenable to judicial review by a Constitutional Court, its employees would not have the right to invoke the powers of the High Court conferred by Article 226 in respect of matter relating to service where they are not governed or controlled by the statutory provisions.  In this case, it was further held by the Top Court that the actions or decisions taken solely within the confines of an ordinary contract of service, having no statutory force or backing, cannot be recognized as being amenable to challenge under Article 226 of the Constitution.  Further, taking note of the facts of the case, the Court said that the Writ Petition would not maintainable for one more reason that there are several disputed questions of fact involved in the case.   “Whether or not the appellant was duly selected and appointed, and what were his service conditions, are facts which are in dispute and regarding which no material is available on record. For this reason, also, the Writ Petition would not be maintainable,” the Court said.   Against this backdrop, the Division bench dismissed the Special Appeal while agreeing with the view taken by the single judge in its 2017 order.

The Supreme Court, while noting the plight of a physically disabled employee, stated that disabled employees should not be forced to forfeit seniority for choosing posting place as per a beneficial circular. The circular in question was issued by the Finance Department of the Rajasthan Government. It directed the appointing authorities to consider the posting of persons with disabilities at or near the place for which they opt at the time of appointment.  A bench comprising Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice JK Maheshwari opined that while the physically disabled appellant was appointed in 1993, which was before the Circular was passed in 2000, having regard to the object of issuance of the Circular, which was to enable handicapped employees to opt for posting at a convenient place, the benefit of the circular would be extended even to those candidates who were appointed before issuance of the Circular. Briefly, the facts of the case are that the appellant, a handicapped candidate of the "OBC" category, was selected as Senior Teacher under the Education Department of the Government of Rajasthan, Deeplana in Hanumangarh, District Bikaner, through a direct competitive examination. However, Deeplana, where the Appellant was posted was located at a distance of about 550 kms away from Behror, the place of residence of the Appellant in Alwar District. As per a Circular issued by the Finance Department of the Rajasthan Government, all appointing authorities were directed to consider the appointment/posting of persons with disabilities at or near the place for which they opt at the time of appointment/posting. After the issuance of Circular, the appellant made a representation to be transferred to his home district Alwar, considering his physical disability. Accordingly, the Deputy Director of Education (Secondary) transferred the Appellant to Alwar. However, the transfer to his home district entailed a down-gradation in his seniority. In 2016, the Appellant was promoted to the post of Junior Lecturer and posted at the Government Aadarsh Senior Secondary School at Nangalkhodia, Behror, Alwar. In 2017, the temporary eligibility list of qualified teachers for promotion to the post of Head Master was published and the name of the Appellant did not feature in the list as his name had been deleted from the the State and Divisional level seniority list in 2007 and as a result, had been changed in the seniority list from 870 to 1318. The Appellant filed a Writ Petition before the Single Judge of the Jaipur Bench of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan, challenging the downgrading of his seniority. However, the same was dismissed. Thereafter, he appealed to the Division Bench, which also dismissed his appeal based on Explanation to Sub-Rule (10) of Rule 29 of the Rajasthan Educational Subordinate Services Rules, 1971 (the Explanation). As per the said Explanation, when an employee is transferred to a district based on his request, he should be placed below the junior most person in the district. Here, the court opined that the actions of the Respondent-Authorities ex facie violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. On a perusal of the Explanation, the court stated that the said explanation applied to employees in general to discourage transfers on request and that it affects only the district-wise seniority. The Explanation will not alter state level seniority. The court, acknowledged that the Appellant was appointed in 1993, long before the Circular for appointment/posting of persons with disability at or near the place of their choice was issued in 2000. However, it stated that having regard to the object of issuance of the Circular, which was to enable handicapped employees to opt for posting at a convenient place, the benefit of the circular had to be extended even to those candidates appointed before issuance of the Circular. Accordingly, the court noted that exclusion of the benefit of the Circular to handicapped employees already in employment at the time of its issuance, would violate the fundamental right of those employees to equality under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. Fundamental rights of disabled persons While opining upon the marginalisation of people with disabilities, the court highlighted that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD), which is aimed at protecting the human rights and dignity of persons with disability, was adopted to ensure inherent dignity and individual autonomy of persons with disability. The court underscored that the right of nondiscrimination under the UNCRPD, would include reasonable accommodation and/or concessions for full and effective participation and inclusion in society. Since UNCRPD had been ratified by India, the State was thus obliged to give effect to the UNCRPD.  The court further stated that– "Furthermore, the disabled are entitled to the fundamental right of equality enshrined in Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India, the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 including the right to carry out any occupation, profession, the right to life under Article 21, which has now been interpreted to mean the right to live with dignity, which has to be interpreted liberally in relation to the disabled." While noting that one of the hindrances/disadvantages faced by the physically disabled persons was the inability to move freely and easily, the court held that the object of the Circular issued for posting disabled persons to places of their choice was to enable the physically disabled to be posted at a place where assistance may readily be available. Further, the distance from the residence was s relevant consideration to avoid commuting long distances. The court stated that– "The benefit which has been given to the disabled through the Circular/Government Order cannot be taken away by subjecting the exercise of the right to avail of the benefit on such terms and conditions, as would render the benefit otiose...Both the Single Bench as also the Division Bench of the High Court have overlooked the scope and ambit of the Explanation which has no application in the State to seniority. In our view, the High Court should have been more sensitive and empathetic to the plight of a physically disabled...The High Court failed to appreciate that treatment of unequals as equals ignoring their special needs violates Article 14 of the Constitution." Accordingly, the Respondents were directed to restore the seniority of the Appellant in the State to the original position, taking into account the service rendered by him in Hanumangarh. Mr.Rahul Shyam Bhandari, AOR and Mr. Akash Sinha, Adv. appeared for the appellant. Mr. Ashish Kumar, AAG, Mr. Sushil Kumar Singh, Adv., Mr. Jordan R., Adv. Mr. Sandeep Kumar Jha, AOR appeared for the State. CASE TITLE: NET RAM YADAV v. THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN & ORS.   Summary - A person appointed under quota for Persons With Disabilities was allowed to choose his place of posting as per a beneficial circular issued by the Government- Later, in the state seniority list, his seniority was downgraded for having opted for transfer - The State relied on a provision in the service rules as per which a person will choose seniority within a district on transfer as per his request - The Court held that provision cannot alter state wise seniority - Also, the Court held that the benefit given to disabled persons as per the circular cannot be rendered otiose by imposing conditions. Rights of Persons With Disabilities Act 2016 - The marginalization of the disabled/handicapped is a human rights issue, which has been the subject matter of deliberations and discussion all over the world. There is increasing global concern to ensure that the disabled are not sidelined on account of their disability (Para 26) Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 - Furthermore, the disabled are entitled to the fundamental right of equality enshrined in Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India, the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 including the right to carry out any occupation, profession, the right to life under Article 21, which has now been interpreted to mean the right to live with dignity, which has to be interpreted liberally in relation to the disabled (Para 30 Rights of Persosn with Disabilties Act 2016 -One of the hindrances/disadvantages faced by the physically disabled persons is the inability to move freely and easily. In consideration of the obstacles encountered by persons with disabilities, the State has issued the said notification/circular dated 20th July 2000 for posting disabled persons to places of their choice, to the extent feasible. The object of this benefit to the physically disabled is to, inter alia, enable the physically disabled to be posted at a place where assistance may readily be available. The distance from the residence may be a relevant consideration to avoid commuting long distances. The benefit which has been given to the disabled through the Circular/Government Order cannot be taken away by subjecting the exercise of the right to avail of the benefit on such terms and conditions, as would render the benefit otiose (Para 31)      
The Allahabad High Court today granted bail to Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan in connection with a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case initiated against him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).  Significantly, the Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh noted in its order that except for the allegations that ₹5K was transferred in the bank account of the co-accused (Atikur Rahman), there is no other transaction, either in the bank account of Kappan or in the Co-accused bank account. "Even if it is believed that part of the proceeds of the crime was transferred to the bank account of the co-accused, Atikur Rahman that itself may not be sufficient to prove that the accused-applicant has dealt with the proceeds of crime amounting to Rs. 1,36,14,291/-which had been allegedly received by K.A. Rauf Sherif," the bench added (emphasis supplied). This observation of the High Court assumes significance as due to the pendency of this very case against him, Kappan had to remain in jail for 3 more months despite being granted bail in all other cases by the Supreme Court in September 2022. Essentially, the ED's case against Kappan was that Kappan and his co-accused are members of the 'Popular Front of India' (PFI) and in furtherance of a larger conspiracy hatched by the Secretary of PFI (K.A. Rauf Sherif), they visited Hathras with an intention to disturb communal harmony, instigating riots and spreading terror and to fund anti-CAA protest and for other unlawful activities of PFI. It has been further alleged that to give effect to the said criminal conspiracy, Rs. 1,36,14,291/- was collected from abroad through bogus and manufactured transactions, and the same were transferred in the account of co-accused. Importantly, the ED has alleged that the proceeds of crime generated through the offence of criminal conspiracy under Section 120-B IPC, which is scheduled offence under PMLA, was used by K.A. Rauf Sherif and his associates, namely, Atikur Rahman, Masud Ahmed, Sidhique Kappan (present accused-applicant) and Mohd. Alam to commit offences under Sections 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. However, the complaint disclosed that only Rs.5,000/- was transferred to the bank account of Kappan's co-accused Atikur Rahman, who was accompanying the accused-applicant.In other words, except for Rs.5,000/-, no other transaction was shown to have been received by the accused-applicant or Atikur Rahman. In view of this, noting that except for allegations that Rs. 5,000/- was transferred in the bank account of co-accused, Atikur Rahman, there is no other transaction, either in the bank account of the accused-applicant or in the bank account of the co-accused, the Court granted him bail by observing thus: "Considering the aforesaid facts, coupled with the contention on behalf of the accused-applicant that in the present case the twin conditions, as mentioned under Section 45 of the PMLA, are not attracted inasmuch as the proceeds of crime is less than Rs.1 Crore and there is no likelihood of the accused-applicant to commit the same offence in future, and the fact the accused-applicant has already been in prison in predicate offences from 05.10.2020 till he was enlarged on bail by the Supreme Court, and thereafter he is in custody of the ED, I am of the view that the accused-applicant is entitled to be released on bail."

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that when a draft assessment order/show cause notice is issued to an assessee, reasonable time ought to be furnished to respond to the notice, so as to comply with the principles of natural justice. Observing thus, a bench comprising Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Pankaj Jain set aside the re-assessment order passed by the respondent authorities under Section 147 read with Section 144-B of the Income Tax Act 1961 on the very next day. Significantly, the draft assessment order/show cause notice was issued on March 30 at 8pm and the assessee was called upon to furnish a reply on the same date itself i.e. by March 30, 11.59 PM. Further, the final order was passed on the next day, i.e., March 31. The Court however granted liberty to the respondents to proceed afresh in the matter regarding framing of the re-assessment order de novo from the stage of issuance of the draft assessment order/show cause notice and to conclude proceedings within a period of four months after affording due and adequate opportunity to the assessee.  Court further observed that the assessee ought to have been given a reasonable time to respond to the draft assessment order/show cause notice so as to comply with the principles of natural justice in consonance with a fair and transparent procedure.  There would be no gainsaying the assessee ought to have been furnished a reasonable time to respond to the draft assessment order/show cause notice so as to comply with the principles of natural justice. The same would also be consonance with a fair and transparent procedure.  After considering submissions of the parties in the light of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the court concluded that the impugned reassessment order has been set aside on the ground that due opportunity had not been afforded to the assessee to respond to the draft assessment order/show cause notice.

Dealing with the plea of an inter-religious couple who alleged that private respondent/s is interfering with their marital life and liberty, the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday clarified that the fact of the petitioner (Girl) having converted to Islam would not be a relevant factor while ensuring that there is no interference in the liberty of the petitioners. The Bench of Justice Salil Kumar Rai was hearing the plea of a Girl (aged 20 years who converted to Islam) and Man (aged 40 years) and they sought direction upon the respondents not to interfere with their marital life and liberty.  They claimed that they are major and have solemnized marriage out of their own free will and also alleged that private respondent/s is interfering with their marital life and liberty. Referring to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Lata Singh Vs. State of U.P., AIR 2006 SC 2522, the Court observed that Law is settled that it is the right of couples to live peacefully without any interference in case they are major.  Further, the court observed that in view of the clear enunciation of law by the Apex Court in Lata Singh's case, it is obligatory for the concerned authorities to ensure compliance of the above directions in view of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.  The Court said that in case petitioners face any genuine threat to their life and liberty, or they are harassed, contrary to the law laid down in Lata Singh, it shall be open for them to approach the Senior Superintendent of Police of the District concerned and furnish necessary details in that regard, like proof of their majority, marriage and alleged harassment etc., who shall take all steps as may be required in law to ensure that petitioners' life and liberty are not interfered with, Significantly, the Court also clarified: "That petitioners, if major, are entitled to live together even if not married and, therefore, proof of their marriage would not be required and shall not be insisted upon by the concerned Police Officer. It is further clarified that the fact of the petitioner having converted to Islam would not be a relevant factor while ensuring that there is no interference in the liberty of the petitioners unless there is any allegation by petitioner no.1 regarding forcible conversion."

The Gujarat High Court has come down heavily on the police for being "swayed by the fact that the Petitioners belong to a particular community" while investigating activities of theft and other wrongs under Sections 328 and 394 of IPC has expressed dismay at the "apathy of the police officials, more particularly senior officers…"  Justice Nikhil Kariel was hearing a special criminal application filed by the Petitioners involving "extreme excess" by the police authorities including senior officers of the level of DySP and SP who were responsible for conducting an impartial inquiry. The Bench noted that the victims, members of a certain community, were earning their living through honest occupation when an FIR was filed against two unknown males and unknown females. According to the inquiry conducted by Respondent No. 6, the Petitioners 1 and 2 (brothers) were passing on a motorbike and were intercepted by the police. When they did not stop, they slipped and were caught by the police. It was observed that the only evidence against the Petitioners was their own confession which was used for submitting the chargesheet. Subsequently, the charges against the Petitioners did not stand during trial.   Justice Kariel also observed that the Petitioners were cultivating cotton on certain land and the ornaments and money recovered from them were borne of their earnings and were not connected to the proceeds of the crime. Additionally, the IO had undertaken an Identification Parade with regard to another offence against the Petitioners. The certificates issued by the Medical Officer revealed that the Petitioners had sustained numerous injuries due to torture by police authorities. The Bench remarked:  "The report also reveals the probable reason for which the petitioners appear to have been apprehended in the first place and as referred to hereinabove, that would relate to the accident of the birth of the petitioners."  Taking note of the profiling of the Petitioners as lawbreakers, the High Court directed Respondent No. 4 ie, the Inspector General of Police, Ahmedabad Range to conduct an inquiry into the cause of arrest of the Petitioners and their implication in "undetected offences" and submit a "very clear report" as to whether any excess was committed by the police officials. The Bench averred that the final report be submitted to the Court by way of an affidavit and that stringent action be taken against the officials. Prima facie, the Bench opined, the Petitioners had been falsely implicated in 5 FIRs basis 'wrong investigation" and therefore, an Officer not below the rank of Deputy Secretary of Home Department were responsible for explaining why the Petitioners were not entitled to exemplary compensation vide an affidavit.   Accordingly, the Bench listed the matter for 12th April 2022 for filing of such affidavits.

The Supreme Court observed that externment is not an ordinary measure and it must be resorted to sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances.  The effect of the order of externment is of depriving a citizen of his fundamental right of free movement throughout the territory of India and therefore the restriction imposed by passing an order of externment must stand the test of reasonableness., the bench comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed. In this case, a resident of District Jalna was directed to remove himself outside the limits of District Jalna within 5 days. Invoking powers under Section 56(1)(a)(b) of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, the competent authority had passed this order of externment on the ground that his activities are very dangerous and the offences registered against him under the Indian Penal Code  are of grave and serious nature which are causing disturbance to the public at large. The Bombay High Court dismissed his writ petition challenging this order. In appeal, the Apex Court bench, at the outset, observed thus:  4..Under clause (d) of Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India, there is a fundamental right conferred on the citizens to move freely throughout the territory of India. In view of clause (5) of Article 19, State is empowered to make a law enabling the imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by clause (d). An order of externment passed under provisions of Section 56 of the 1951 Act imposes a restraint on the person against whom the order is made from entering a particular area. Thus, such orders infringe the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(d). Hence, the restriction imposed by passing an order of externment must stand the test of reasonableness. 7. There cannot be any manner of doubt that an order of externment is an extraordinary measure. The effect of the order of externment is of depriving a citizen of his fundamental right of free movement throughout the territory of India. In practical terms, such an order prevents the person even from staying in his own house along with his family members during the period for which this order is in subsistence. In a given case, such order may deprive the person of his livelihood. It thus follows that recourse should be taken to Section 56 very sparingly keeping in mind that it is an extraordinary measure. Referring to Section 56 of the Maharashtra Police Act, the court observed that there must be objective material on record on the basis of which the competent authority must record its subjective satisfaction that the movements or acts of any person are causing or calculated to cause alarm, danger or harm to persons or property.  "7...For passing an order under clause (b), there must be objective material on the basis of which the competent authority must record subjective satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds for believing that such person is engaged or is about to be engaged in the commission of an offence involving force or violence or offences punishable under Chapter XII, XVI or XVII of the IPC. Offences under Chapter XII are relating to Coin and Government Stamps. Offences under Chapter XVI are offences affecting the human body and offences under Chapter XVII are offences relating to the property. In a given case, even if multiple offences have been registered which are referred in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 56 against an individual, that by itself is not sufficient to pass an order of externment under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 56. Moreover, when clause (b) is sought to be invoked, on the basis of material on record, the competent authority must be satisfied that witnesses are not willing to come forward to give evidence against the person proposed to be externed by reason of apprehension on their part as regards their safety or their property. The recording of such subjective satisfaction by the competent authority is sine qua non for passing a valid order of externment under clause (b).", the court said. The court added that though the competent authority is not expected to write a judgment containing elaborate reasons, it must record its subjective satisfaction of the existence of one of the grounds in sub-section (1) of Section 56 on the basis of objective material placed before it. The court said: "10....Though the competent authority is not required to record reasons on par with a judicial order, when challenged, the competent authority must be in a position to show the application of mind. The Court while testing the order of externment cannot go into the question of sufficiency of material based on which the subjective satisfaction has been recorded. However, the Court can always consider whether there existed any material on the basis of which a subjective satisfaction could have been recorded. The Court can interfere when either there is no material or the relevant material has not been considered. The Court cannot interfere because there is a possibility of another view being taken. As in the case of any other administrative order, the judicial review is permissible on the grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness or arbitrariness." Referring to materials on record, the bench found that, in this case, non-application of mind is apparent on the face of the record. The court added that if the order of externment for the maximum permissible period of two years is passed without recording subjective satisfaction regarding the necessity of extending the order of externment to the maximum permissible period, it will amount to imposing unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed under clause (d) of Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India. "Perusal of the impugned Judgment and order of the High Court shows that unfortunately, the Division Bench did not notice that an order of externment is not an ordinary measure and it must be resorted to sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances. It was the duty of the Constitutional Court to test the said order within the parameters which are well-settled by this Court.", the bench said while allowing the appeal.         
The Delhi High Court bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora ruled that the right to file an objection to the Show Cause Notice cannot be denied owing to a one-day delay.  The petitioner has challenged the order passed under Section 148A (d) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the notice passed under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act.  The petitioner was given time till April 8, 2022, to reply to the show cause notice dated March 30, 2022. The order under Section 148A(d) was issued without taking the petitioner's request for adjournment or detailed response to the Show Cause notice into account.The order proceeded on the basis that the petitioner did not file any reply to the show cause notice.  The department contended that the adjournment request had not been filed within the stipulated time, i.e., till April 8, 2022. Therefore, the Assessing Officer was well within his right to pass the order under Section 148A (d) of the Income Tax Act.  The court observed that the petitioner has a right to get adequate time in accordance with the Income Tax Act to submit its reply.   "Section 148A(b) permits the Assessing Officer to suo moto provide up to thirty days period to an assessee to respond to the Show Cause Notice issued under Section 148A(b), which period may in fact be further extended upon an application made by the Assessee in this behalf, and such period given to the assessee is excluded in computing the period of limitation for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act in terms of the third proviso to Section 149 of the Act," the court said.  The court held that since the petitioner is a resident of the United States of America, the delay of one day in asking for an adjournment should not have led to the closure of the right to file a reply to the Show Cause Notice.  The court set aside the order passed under Section 148A (d) as well as the notice under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act. The court directed the department to pass a fresh reasoned order under Section 148A (d) after considering the reply filed by the petitioner in accordance with the law within eight weeks.

The Delhi High Court has observed that barring a student from taking examinations on the ground of non-payment of fees would be infringement of rights of a child as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  Justice Mini Pushkarna observed that a child’s future cannot be allowed to be spoiled and blemished by barring him or her from taking examinations, especially at a crucial juncture of class X and XII examinations.  “Thus, a child cannot be made to suffer and not be allowed to attend classes or barred from taking examinations in the middle of an academic session on the ground of non-payment of fees. Education is the foundation, which shapes the future of a child and which in turn shapes the future of the society in general,” the court said. It added: "Therefore, not allowing a student to take examinations, especially the Board Examinations, would be infringement of the rights of a child akin to Right to Life as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Supreme Court has expanded the rights under Article 21 of Constitution of India and education is certainly one of the important rights which would be encompassed under right to life. In furtherance of the same, Article 21A of the Constitution of India provides for Right to Education, wherein the State has been ordained to provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years." The court also observed that in the context of Indian Society, Class 10th and Class 12th Board Examinations are vitally important and critical, having decisive repercussions and bearing on the future of a student.  However, the court also said that a private unaided school cannot be forced to continue with a child who is unable to pay fees, having taken admission in the general quota and not under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) or Disadvantaged Group (DG) quota.  “Therefore, the rights of a child to education has to be balanced with the rights of the school under the DSER, 1973. The constitutionality and validity of Rule 35 of Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, which authorises the Head of the school to strike off the name of a student from the rolls of the school on account of non-payment of fees, has not been struck down by any Court of law,” the court said.  Taking a “compassionate and sympathetic view”, Justice Pushkarna permitted a class X student to take the board examination after his name was struck off due to non-payment of fees by The Indian School.  Stating that the petitioner child does not have a right to continue education in the school if he is unable to pay the fees, the court, however, said the minor cannot be tormented in the middle of an academic session. The plea was listed on January 17 upon urgent mentioning since the practical exams for class X board examination were scheduled from January 18.  While granting relief to the petitioner, the court deprecated the parent's conduct in approaching the court at the eleventh hour, when the practical board examinations were to commence after one day.  “However, it is noted that the petitioner has approached this Court at a belated stage despite the fact that name of the petitioner had been struck off by the school firstly by way of letter dated 07.09.2022 and subsequently, by way of letter dated 19.11.2022,” the court said.  The court directed the school to issue the CBSE Roll Number to the petitioner to enable him to take up the Board Examinations. The school was also directed to allow the child to attend any classes or special classes that may be held for imparting education to the children for class X board examinations.  However, in order to balance the equities, the court considered it imperative to direct the petitioner child to pay some amount towards the fees payable to the school.  “In the facts and circumstances of the case, since it has been expressed on behalf of the father of the petitioner that the family is undergoing financial constraints, it is directed that the petitioner shall pay an amount of Rs.30,000/- to the school within a period of four weeks from today on account of the dues payable to the school towards the fees,” the court directed. Advocates Malka Asad and Sonal Singh represented the petitioner. The petition was filed through advocate Hardik Rupal. Title: PSV v. THE INDIAN SCHOOL & ANR  
Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with a petition challenging the order and appeal whereby the application for grant of arms license has been rejected, held that the reasons assigned for dismissing an application cannot be different from the ones prescribed under Clause (a) and (b) of Section 14(1) of the Arms Act, 1959.  Moreover, the reasons assigned for dismissing an application for grant of licence cannot be different than the reasons prescribed under Clause (a) and (b) of Section 14(1).  The bench comprising Justice Jaishree Thakur while allowing the petitions held that, it was incumbent upon the licensing authority to assign proper and real reasons, which they failed to do so in the instant case.  In the instant case, the reason assigned by the licensing authority and the appellate authority that there is no evidence to prove that life of the petitioner is in danger and he needs a weapon for self protection are totally in variance to the report submitted by the police and therefore, it was incumbent upon the licensing authority to assign proper and real reasons, which they failed to comply with.  The court further observed that any instruction/policy cannot override the statutory provisions.   Court placed reliance on Section 14 of the Arms Act, 1959 and held that according to the said section, licensing authority can dismiss an application on certain grounds and is obliged to record reasons in writing where it refuses to grant a license however, the supply of said reasons may be denied in the public interest.  Court further noted that the licensing authority can refuse to grant a license only on the grounds enumerated in Section 14 of the Arms Licence Act, 1959. The licensing authority may differ from the report submitted by the in charge of the nearest police station but the same must be based on an independent enquiry done by licensing authority according to the provisions of Section (2A) of Section 13 of the Arms Act.  The licensing authority can refuse to grant licence only on the grounds as enumerated in Section 14 of the Arms Licence Act, which are reproduced in the preceding paragraphs. It is not in dispute that the licensing authority may differ with the report so submitted by the incharge of the nearest police station but the same ought to be based on an independent enquiry done by licensing authority as per the provisions of Section (2A) of Section 13 of the Arms Act and that too, by recording reasons in writing.  Considering the facts of the instant case, the court noted that the reasons assigned by the licensing authority and the appellate authority are totally in variance to the report submitted by the police.  The court concluded that the reasons assigned by the Licencing Authority/Appellate Authority do not satisfy the mandatory requirement of Section 14 (3) of the Arms Act.   As an upshot of my findings, the reasons assigned by the Licencing Authority/Appellate Authority in the impugned orders while refusing to grant licence to the petitioner do not satisfy the mandatory requirement of Section 14 (3) of the Arms Act.  For the reasons discussed above, the court directed the licensing authority to reconsider the application of the petitioner for grant of arms license in accordance with the statutory provision under the Arms Act.

The Allahabad High Court has DENIED anticipatory bail to Jitendra Narayan Tyagi Alias Syed Waseem Rizvi in connection with a rape case registered against him in the year 2021 by the wife of his former driver. Noting that non-bailable warrants have been issued against Tyagi by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow last month, the bench of Justice Mohd. Faiz Alam Khan did not find any good ground to provide him protection from arrest. Significantly, the Court also took into account the apprehension raised by the informant/victim about Tyagi's influence due to which he could not be traced and he also did not cooperate in the investigation leading to a delay in the probe "Having regard to the various orders passed by the Magistrate directing the investigating officer to conclude the investigation at the earliest, primafacie there is substance in the apprehension of informant/victim. The State in its instructions has mentioned a long criminal history of the applicant comprising of 35 cases starting from the year 1994 till 2022 and in the considered opinion of this Court, criminal antecedents and conduct of the accused is a relevant factor at the time of consideration of plea of anticipatory bail," the Court observed. Further, noting that despite various orders passed by the Magistrate, the investigating officer has not concluded the investigation in the case, the Bench observed that it is expected from the IO to conclude the investigation without any further delay and submit a report under Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C., at the earliest. #JustIN | [2021 Rape Case]The #AllahabadHighCourt DENIES anticipatory bail to Jitendra Narayan Tyagi Alias Syed Waseem Rizvi [@JitendraNTyagi].Investigating officer has also been directed to conclude the investigation in the case without any further delay. pic.twitter.com/jE9mK9WH28— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 17, 2023 The case against Tyagi The case against Tyagi is that he raped the wife of his former driver in the year 2021. The FIR in the case against Tyagi had been lodged by moving an application under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C. It was alleged therein that Tyagi, with whom her husband was working as a driver, had raped her after intimidating her of the life of her children. Thereafter, the allegations state, the applicant used to commit rape with the prosecutrix occasionally, after sending her husband outside Lucknow and she remained silent as she was threatened and was also apprehended and intimidated. It is the further allegations that on 11th June 2021, when the informant informed her husband about all the misdeeds of Tyagi, he approached Tyagi to protest about his misdeeds but he was threatened by Tyagi and under apprehension, the husband of the informant vacated the residence provided by the applicant. On the other hand, seeking protection from arrest in the instant case, Tyagi moved the High Court by arguing that having regard to his ideology and petitions filed by him in the #SupremeCourt, certain fundamentalists are against him and they were instrumental in lodging the false Rape case against him. It was also argued by him that he has been provided with Y-Plus Security cover by the Government in which 16 police personnel always remain posted with him and as such it is impossible for him to commit Rape in the manner alleged by the informant/victim. Lastly, it was also submitted that he is a respectable citizen and had enjoyed a very high position of Chairman, Shia Waqf Board, and his arrest, in this case, will bring a bad name to his otherwise good reputation and would also injure his liberty. Court's observations and order At the outset, the Court perused the case diary of the case to note that several affidavits were given by the husband of the informant as well as by the informant stating that he is being pressurized to withdraw the case and the informant/victim is also apprehending threat to her life.  The Court also noted that on various applications moved by the informant/victim, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow passed at least 7 orders directing the investigating officer to conclude the investigation in a fair manner and with the expedition. It was further noted by the bench that during the course of the investigation, the IO had recorded the statement of certain witnesses who stated that they have seen the applicant on many occasions, going towards the quarter of the informant in absence of her husband.  The Court also observed that it was on 20.12.2022, that the investigating officer for the very first time started searching the whereabouts of the applicant and thereafter on various occasions the applicant was searched but his whereabouts could not be traced. Against this backdrop, noting that there was no good ground to extend him the benefit of anticipatory bail, the Court rejected his plea by directing that a copy of its order be communicated to the concerned investigating officer through the Commissioner of Police, Lucknow, forthwith for necessary action.

The Delhi High Court recently expressed concern of the "unfortunate practice" of police filing POCSO cases at the behest of girl's family who object to her romantic involvement and friendship with young boys."Consensual sex has been in legal grey area because the consent given by minor cannot be said to be a valid consent in the eyes of law...The rigor of the law is therefore being misapplied... The Delhi High Court recently expressed concern of the "unfortunate practice" of police filing POCSO cases at the behest of girl's family who object to her romantic involvement and friendship with young boys. "Consensual sex has been in legal grey area because the consent given by minor cannot be said to be a valid consent in the eyes of law...The rigor of the law is therefore being misapplied and subsequently misused," observed Justice Subramonium Prasad while granting bail to a 21 year old man accused in the case. The Court observed that the accused being a young man and having a full life ahead of him, cannot be deprived of his liberties. "The short question which arises is as to whether the petitioner should be granted bail or not. Whereas, what has become a trite and unfortunate practice is that the Police are filing POCSO cases at the behest of the family of a girl who object to her friendship and romantic involvement with a young boy," the Court said. An FIR was registered against the man last year under Sections 376, 313, 328, 506 of IPC read with sec. 6 POCSO Act. According to the complainant, a girl aged 16 years, the man had stalked her while she would go to school and expressed his intention to make friends with her but she resisted.  It was thereafter alleged that one day, the man forcefully took her to his house where she was raped. Later, it was found that she was pregnant by 7-8 weeks.  It was the case of the Petitioner-accused that the Complainant girl was coerced by her family members to file the FIR and that the family was motivated by the support of an NGO. It was also argued that the family objected to their consenting friendship. "This Court has also perused the photographs which has been produced wherein the petitioner and the prosecutrix found are to be shown in very close proximity and it is apparent that they were in a relationship with each other," the Court observed at the outset after considering the statements on record. Accordingly the Court opined that the age of the man and girl, the photograph categorically pointing towards a relationship between the two, the discrepancies in the statements given at the time of the recordings of the MLC and the FIR were all mitigating factors which tilt the balance towards the grant of bail. "It appears, in the facts and circumstances of this case, as if the present FIR has been lodged at the insistence of the family of the victim/complainant who were perhaps embarrassed on finding that the complainant had become pregnant and if this was known in the neighborhood there would be a social backlash that the family would encounter and, in order to avoid the social embarrassment and to get the pregnancy medically terminated this FIR has been filed giving it the color of sexual exploitation and bringing it in the ambit of the POCSO Act which envisages the abolition of child abuse," the Court said. The bail was accordingly granted to the petitioner after observing thus: "The petitioner has been in jail for over 12 months and is being subjected to be in the company of hardened criminals. This would do more harm than good to a common man of 21 years of age." Case Title: PRADUMAN v. THE STATE (GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI) & ANR

The Calcutta High Court has recently refused to grant relief under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for condonation of delay of about 302 days in filing an appeal.  Justice Bibek Chaudhuri remarked that the government agency is not a privileged litigant and no explanation is forthcoming as to why the heads of various offices of CBI took such an unusual time to release the record of the case for the purpose of filing the appeal. "..the Government or a Government agency is not a privileged litigant. The Government agency is required to explain the delay in the same manner like that of an ordinary litigant to get the relief of condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act", the Court underscored.  Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in Office of the Chief Post Master General & Ors. v.  Living Media India Ltd. & Anr wherein it had been held that unless government bodies and their agencies have a reasonable explanation for the delay, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red-tape in the process. Further opining that it has not been explained why the CBI took such an unusual time to file the appeal after the expiry of almost 302 days of limitation, the Court observed,  "The petitioner has stated in the said paragraph different dates when the file was sent to different offices of CBI. It has not been stated why the office of various heads of office of CBI took unusual time to release the record and finally allowed the appeal to be filed after expiry of 302 days of Limitation." Thus, the Court observed that the CBI has not been able to come up with satisfactory explanation in support of its case for condonation of delay. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act as well as the Special Leave application.  Background  The CBI had filed an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay of 302 days in filing the appeal against the impugned judgment and order of acquittal. Furthermore, the Court was apprised that the Regional Office of the CBI at Kolkata has no authority to decide as to whether an appeal should be filed against an order of acquittal or not. The permission comes from Delhi office and only after getting the official permission, the CBI, Kolkata can file an appeal under Section 378(3) of the CrPC against an order of acquittal. The Court was further informed that the delay had been caused in the offices of the Superintendent of Police and the Head of the Branch as a result of which there was an inordinate delay of 302 days in preferring the appeal.   On the other hand, the respondents argued that the explanation for condonation of delay is vague, misconceived, speculative, baseless and bereft of better or more particulars. It was further contended that official delay in according permission to the CBI to file appeal against an order of acquittal cannot be said to be a sufficient cause for delay in filing the appeal. Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in State (Delhi Administration) v. Dharam Pal to contend that under Section 378 CrPC, the State Government or the Central Government shall have to file an appeal from an order of acquittal within 90 days from the date of the impugned judgement and order of acquittal being passed.  Case Title: Central Bureau of Investigation v.

The Supreme Court has discussed the differences between 'furlough' and 'parole' and the principles relating to grant of them. A bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice BV Nagarathna stated the broad principles as : (i)	Furlough and parole envisage a short-term temporary release from custody; (ii)	While parole is granted for the prisoner to meet a specific exigency, furlough may be granted after a stipulated number of years have been served without any reason; (iii)	The grant of furlough is to break the monotony of imprisonment and to enable the convict to maintain continuity with family life and integration with society; (iv)	Although furlough can be claimed without a reason, the prisoner does not have an absolute legal right to claim furlough; (v)	The grant of furlough must be balanced against the public interest and can be refused to certain categories of prisoners. Referring to various precedents, the bench also observed that balance needs to be maintained between two competing interests while granting parole or furlough- that of reforming the convict on one hand and the public purpose and interests of society on the other:  The bench was deciding an appeal filed by the State of Gujarat against a judgment of the Gujarat High Court which granted two weeks' furlough to self-proclaimed godman and rape convict Asaram's son Narayan Sai who is also serving life term in a 2014 rape case. The convict had approached the High Court after the DGP rejected his application for furlough. Furlough not a matter of right Referring to the provisions of the Bombay Furlough and Parole Rules, the bench noted that the Rules do not confer a legal right on a prisoner to be released on furlough. The grant of furlough is regulated by Rule 3 and Rule 4. While Rule 3 provides the eligibility criteria for grant of furlough for prisoners serving different lengths of imprisonment, Rule 4 imposes limitations. The use of the expression "may be released" in Rule 3 indicates the absence of an absolute right. This is further emphasised in Rule 17 which states that said Rules do not confer a legal right on a prisoner to claim release on furlough.   The Court further noted that the the Jail Superintendent has given a negative opinion based on the fact that the respondent kept a mobile phone inside the jail illegally and attempted to make contacts with the outside world. Setting aside the High Court order, the judgment authored by Justice Chandrachud stated : "The order dated 8 May 2021 has adduced a number of circumstances which cumulatively indicate that the release of the respondent on furlough may lead to a violation of public peace. The order refers specifically to the threat he and his followers pose to the complainant and other persons who deposed at the trial. An attempt has been made to threaten and suborn the investigating team and the witnesses. The respondent and his father have a mass following of persons who owe loyalty to them and there is a reasonable apprehension of a disruption of public peace and tranquillity. During the trial, attempts have been made to bribe public officials. The conduct after the trial, in jail, has not been shown to be above reproach. The respondent was released earlier this year to accommodate a genuine need to attend to his mother's health at the relevant time. Based on this, we are unable to agree with the line of reasoning of the High Court" Case Details Case Title : State of Gujarat versus Narayan Sai Coram : Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice BV Nagarathna Appearances : Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for State of Gujarat; Advocate Sanjiv Punalekar for respondent.

The Madras High Court on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the quality of education imparted in government schools and observed that students from marginalized sections and rural students studying in Government schools should be provided quality education on par with students studying in private schools. The Bench of Justice N. Kirubakaran and Justice T. V. Thamilselvi was presiding over a writ appeal filed in connection with the service conditions for getting promoted as headmasters of Govt. primary schools. The Court opined that though Tamil Nadu is the hub of higher education, the standard of school education especially in the rural areas and Government schools is stated to be substandard. But, the Court noted that since the matter relates to Primary School Head Masters, it is appropriate to look into the conditions of the school students who are studying in the Government Schools especially in rural areas. "Lack of infrastructures in the Government Schools and poor quality of education being provided to the Government School students are the reasons for less admission of students in Government schools," added the Court. Issues regarding Government school teachers The Court observed that even though the Government School Teachers are paid handsome salary when compared to Private School Teachers, who get very less salary and work more hours, education being given to Government School students cannot be compared with Private School Students.  Importantly, the Court said: "Infrastructures including labs, libraries and toilets are properly provided in the Private Schools. Due to poor quality of education the Government school students could not get admission in medical colleges, the Government was compelled to provide 7.5% special reservation for the Government School students in medical admission" The Court noted that many cases have come up before this Court, involving Government School teachers, who have not attended Schools for days together, thereby affecting the education of the students.  "Though there are very many committed teachers, who have to be appreciated and applauded for their sincere devoted teaching are working in Government Schools, the number of erring teachers, who are not committed to the teaching are increasing," the Court added. The Court was also of the view that there is lack of enthusiasm among the teachers in the rural areas to impart education to the students as many of the teachers are stated to be involved in various other private avocations and concentrate on them. Court's orders The Court batted for taking of urgent measures to improve the quality of education by providing required infrastructures, appointing qualified teachers at the school level and advocated for a constant vigil on the teachers, so that the education is imparted to the students properly. In view of the above position, this Court hoped that a committee would be constituted with experts and academicians to look into the reasons for poor quality of education in Government Schools and suggest corrective measures or the Government on its own taken any other corrective measures to enhance the quality of school education in Government schools. Therefore, the Court directed the Government to ask the industries to adopt one or two Government Schools so that infrastructures and the standard of education would be improved.  Lastly, the State Government's Counsel was directed to file a status report with regard to the constitution of the committee as suggested by the Court or any other measures taken by the Government on its own to look into the factors affecting the school education in Government Schools, especially in rural areas and suggest appropriate measures to improve the quality of the education and the implementation of the order passed by the Madurai Bench of this Court directing provision of toilets in every school and construction of compound walls on the next date of hearing.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that writing a letter to the husband's superior at work in good faith intimating him about a criminal case lodged against the husband for inflicting torture would not amount to criminal defamation under Section 499 of the IPC.  In the instant case, the wife (petitioner) had written a letter dated May 24, 1997 to the Manager, Indian Overseas Bank intimating him that her husband who was the Assistant Manager of Overseas Bank had tortured her and driven her out of the matrimonial home and that a criminal case under Section 498A CrPC (cruelty) had been initiated against him following which he had been arrested and subsequently released on bail. The petitioner had enclosed a certified copy of the order and had requested the Manager to take such action as may be deemed fit under the facts and circumstances. Justice Ananda Kumar Mukherjee noted that the petitioner in her letter had made representation of facts which were consistent with the incidents relating to filling of cases for alleged torture. He further opined that there had been no 'embellishment of facts' and that no coercive action had been sought by the petitioner against her husband vide the letter.  "There remains little to be said that the letter in question was a statement of fact instead of any imputation to harm the reputation of the opposite party", the Court observed.  Justice Mukherjee further noted that there was matrimonial discord between the petitioner and her husband to such an extent that the wife was compelled to leave her husband's home with her minor daughter. Opining that it is obvious for the petitioner to take recourse to writing such a letter to her husband's superiors under such oppressive conditions, the Court remarked further,  "This incident itself would heap insult and indignation upon a married lady having a child. Under such oppressive conditions it is only obvious that the petitioner would take recourse to writing such letter to Official Heads of the opposite party. The petitioner wife cannot be faulted for taking recourse to law of the land for protection of herself and her daughter. She should have her right to ventilate her grievance as her human dignity was at peril." Opining further that the the ingredients of offence of defamation are not attracted by the contents of the letter as they are covered by the Eighth Exception laid down under Section 499 IPC, the Court underscored, "..preferring an accusation against any person to any of the persons who have lawful authority over that person, would not amount to defamation. In the instant case the petitioner wife made accusation against the opposite party before his superior in office in good faith and consistent to her accusation made in the petition of complaint. Therefore, the same would not amount to any defamation as the same is excepted in the 8th exception." It was also noted that any representation made by a person in good faith for protecting his/her own interest would not amount to defamation as the Ninth Exception under Section 499 IPC protects imputations made in good faith by person for protection of his or other's interests.  The Court further observed that the Fifth Exception under Section 499 IPC stipulates that a representation would not amount to defamation if an opinion is expressed on the merits of any case in good faith which has been decided by a Court in respect of the conduct of a person. "In the instant case on the basis of the material available in the Case Diary the bail of the opposite party was rejected by the court. Therefore, subsequent acquittal of the opposite party cannot undo his arrest and his released on bail by the court, therefore such representation when made in the letter would be covered by the 5th exception of section 499 of IPC", the Court remarked further.  It was further taken into consideration that the letter had been addressed to the husband's superiors on May 24, 1997 whereas the complaint had been filed by the husband against the petitioner for criminal defamation only on June 8, 2009 that is twelve long years after the cause of action arose. It was further held that the complaint filed under Section 200 CrPC by the husband against the petitioner alleging the offence of criminal defamation is barred by the law of limitation under Section 468 CrPC. Pursuant to Section 469(1)(a) of the CrPC, the period of limitation for taking cognizance in an offence under section 500 of IPC is three years from the date of its initiation. Accordingly, the Court observed that case initiated by the husband is barred by limitation as the date of offence should be construed from the date of issuing the letter, that is on May 24, 1997. Placing reliance on the Allahabad High Court decision in Naresh Chand Jain Vs. State of U.P and others and on the Calcutta High Court judgment in Rabindra Nath Pal v. Ratikanta Paul & others the Court opined that a case for the offence of defamation should be filed within three years from the date of publication.  Thus, the Court set aside the complaint lodged by the husband against the petitioner for the offence of defamation by observing that the same is barred by limitation and thus a continuation of such proceedings would lead to an abuse of the process of Court. Case Title: Malancha Mohinta v. Dipak Mohinta    
The Rajasthan High Court has observed that a decree of divorce is essential for consideration of candidature for appointment against the quota of divorcees and that exemption from presenting such a decree cannot be sought on the ground of customs prevalent in a particular community. With this, the bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Kuldeep Mathur clarified that the claim of divorce on the basis of social practice in public recruitment is not valid and that a decree of divorce is mandatory for a woman who wishes to avail the benefit of the quota reserved for divorced women in government service.  The bench was essentially dealing with an intra-court appeal moved by the Rajasthan Public Service Commission challenging an order of the single judge. Essentially, a bunch of writ petitions were filed before the Single Bench by some of the appellants belonging to the Scheduled Tribe community who had applied for a govenment post under the 'Divorcee Female' Category, however, their applications were rejected during document verification on the ground that they did not have a divorce decree from any court as on the last date of application. It was their case that since they belong to the ST community, a customary divorce is prevalent in their society and therefore, they did not obtain a court decree. It was their further contention that they are eligible to apply under the reserved quota for divorced women in government service without obtaining such a decree as they are governed by the customs prevalent in their community.  Single Judge allowed thier pleas and directed the State Public Service Commission to include the name of the respondents in the select list on the basis of customary dissolution of marriage and provide them appointment from the date candidates lower in merit were granted appointment, if they are otherwise eligible. The Single Judge also observed that since the respondents belonged to Scheduled Tribe community, therefore, the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 are not applicable upon them in light of Section 2(2) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 thus, the condition of submitting divorce decree, issued by a competent court cannot be fastened upon them. Now, when the order was challenged before the division bench, which, at the outset, observed that the requirement of a decree of divorce for a female candidate to claim reservation against the reserved quota for divorcee women on the cut off date/on the last date of submitting application form is sine qua non. Further, opining that the candidature cannot be considered against said category in the absence of decree of divorce issued by the competent court, the Court observed thus while allowing the intra-court appeal of the RPSC: "A custom cannot be allowed to supersede the terms and conditions governing the recruitment process. The terms and conditions of recruitment are framed to adhere to the mandate enshrined under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India which guarantee equal opportunities to all citizens for their advancement in the matter of employment. Candidates belonging to Scheduled Tribe/Tribal Sub Plan are not precluded from obtaining decree of divorce from the competent court having jurisdiction to decide the matrimonial disputes. Exemption from presenting decree of divorce, issued by competent court cannot be sought on the ground of customs prevalent in their communities. The customs/practices prevailing in a particular community cannot be allowed to supplement the terms and conditions of a recruitment process involving large number of candidates belonging to various caste, religion, faith and communities" The Court also went ahead to hold High Court's judgment in the case Rajasthan Public Service Commission vs. Sunita Meena & Ors.: D.B. S.A.W. No.829/2017 to be 'per incuriam'. In Sunita's case, a divison bench had upheld the direction passed by Single Judge in favour of the candidate-petitioner belonging to Meena community (Scheduled Tribe) directing the recruiting agency to consider the candidate a 'Divorcee' as per the customary laws while affording the petitioner-candidate an opportunity to obtain a declaration of dissolution of marriage from competent court. In related news, the Rajasthan High Court earlier this year observed that there is nothing in law that permits a candidate to apply in the 'Divorcee Female' category in the expectancy that a divorce decree would be granted by the Court. A division bench of Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani and Justice Sandeep Mehta, observed, "For a person, applying in the said category, the status of being divorced was imperative. There is nothing in law which can permit a candidate to apply in the said category in the expectancy that a decree would be granted".

Just because FIRs are uploaded, chargesheets cannot be directed to be uploaded in websites.The Supreme Court on Friday held that police and investigating agencies like CBI, ED etc., cannot be directed to upload the chargesheets filed in cases in a public platform for easy access by the general public. A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and CT Ravikumar held so while dismissing a PIL filed by RTI activist and investigative journalist Saurav Das. The bench termed as "misplaced" the reliance made by Advocate Prashant Bhushan on the Supreme Court's judgment in the Youth Bar Association Case in which directions were issued to the police to upload the FIRs in website within 24 hours except in sensitive cases like rape and sexual offences. The Court held that the direction in the Youth Bar Association case cannot be extended to chargesheets. The FIRs were directed to be publicly uploaded so that innocent accused are not harassed and they are able to get the relief from the competent court and are not taken by surprise. This direction cannot be stretched to the public at large so far as the charge sheets are concerned. Direction to upload chargesheets will be contrary to scheme of CrPC The Court further held that the direction sought to put all chargesheets in the public domain is contrary to the scheme of the CrPC.  "It may as such, violate the rights of the accused as well as the victim and/or even the investigation agency. Putting the FIR on the website cannot be equated with putting the charge sheets on public", the bench noted in the order. Reliance on Section 74 and 76 of Evidence Act misconceived. The petitioner had argued that a charge-sheet, not unlike an FIR, was a ‘public document’, since the filing of a charge-sheet was an act of a public official in discharge of their official duties and as such, came under the definitional ambit of ‘public document’ given in Section 74 of the Evidence Act, 1872. Therefore, a charge-sheet filed by a police department, or an investigative agency, Bhushan claimed, would be subject to the discipline of Section 76 of the Act that mandated public disclosure of any public document by a public officer having custody of such document to a person having a ‘right to inspect’. The Court rejected these arguments as misconceived. "Documents mentioned in S.74 of Evidence Act only can be said to be public documents, certified copies of which are to be given by the concerned public authority having the custody of such a public document. Copy of charge sheets along with necessary public documents cannot be said to be public documents u/s 74 of the Evidence Act". The Court also held that copies of the chargesheet and the relevant documents along with the charge-sheet do not fall within Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act - Para 6 Bench expresses reservations about misuse The bench had reserved orders on January 9 at admission stage itself, without issuing notice. During the admission hearing, the bench had expressed certain reservations about the idea. The bench commented that if chargesheets are made available to public, they are likely to be misused. "If FIRs are given to those unrelated to the case, busybodies, NGOs might misuse it", Justice Shah observed.  Justice CT Ravikumar pointed out that the Supreme Court's judgment in the Vijay Madanlal Choudhary case (which upheld the PMLA provisions) had held that ECIR was not akin to FIR and hence the accused was not entitled to a copy of the same. Therefore, the judge expressed a doubt whether a direction can be issued to the ED to publicly upload the chargesheets. "Chargesheets cannot be given to everybody", Justice Shah added. The counsel also relied on National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy approved by the Union Cabinet in 2012 that sought to facilitate access to public data and information in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. “There is no reason why the information contained in charge-sheets, where the investigation has been concluded, the evidence has been examined extensively, and a finding has been reached, should not be published on the website of the prosecuting agency or the state government. This is the kind of information about which every member of the public is entitled to be informed,” Bhushan contended. Bhushan drew support from other statutory enactments such as the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Right to Information Act, 2005 as well. The main thrust of the petitioner’s argument was that not only the Evidence Act, but also the Right to Information Act and the judgments of the High Courts and Central Information Commissions vis-à-vis charge-sheets envisaged that charge-sheets were public documents and thus, available for public disclosure. Bhushan argued, “A charge-sheet filed by a police authority is definitely an act or a record of an act by a public official. Any public document should be given to a person who has the right to demand that. It is our argument that such a document would be disclosable under the Right to Information Act.” He also insisted, “It is the duty of every public authority to put out the information suo motu.” In this connection, it was also pointed out that Section 6(2) of the Right to Information Act provided that no reason or justification was required to seek information. The counsel said, “Any person has the right to seek a copy of the charge-sheet. Under the Right to Information Act, it cannot be asked whether the person seeking the information is connected. Under this Act, the ambit of disclosable information is very wide.” Bhushan also stated that after a chargesheet is filed, trial is to take place in an "open court", where public can have access. Therefore, he argued that the reliefs claimed by the petitioner were in line with the concept of 'open court'. Case Title : Saurav Das vs Union of India |W.P.(C) No. 1126/2022 For Petitioner(s) Mr. Prashant Bhushan, AOR Mrs. Cheryl D’Souza, Adv. Ms. Ria Yadav, Adv.  Summary - Supreme Court refuses to direct that chargesheets filed by investigating agencies should be uploaded on a public website for public access- Court says that the directions in Youth Bar Association of India vs Union of India (2016) 9 SCC 473 regarding uploading of FIR cannot be extended to chargesheets- Court directed the copies of the FIRs to be published within 24 hours on the police websites or on the websites of the State Government, looking to the interest of the accused and so that innocent accused are not harassed and they are able to get the relief from the competent court and they are not taken by surprise. Therefore, the directions issued by this Court are in favour of the accused, which cannot be stretch to the public at large so far as the chargesheets are concerned- Para 4.1 Code of Criminal Procedure 1973- Sections 173, 207 - Direction to publicly upload chargesheets against the scheme of CrPC-If all the chargesheets and relevant documents produced along with the chargesheets are put on the public domain or on the websites of the State Governments it will be contrary to the Scheme of the Criminal Procedure Code and it may as such violate the rights of the accused as well as the victim and/or even the investigating agency. Putting the FIR on the website cannot be equated with putting the chargesheets along with the relevant documents on the public domain and on the websites of the State Governments - Para 4.5 Indian Evidence Act 1872- Section 74, 76-Copy of the chargesheet along with the necessary documents cannot be said to be public documents within the definition of Public Documents as per Section 74 of the Evidence Act.-As per Section 75 of the Evidence Act all other documents other than the documents mentioned in Section 74 of the Evidence Act are all private documents. Therefore, the chargesheet/documents along with the chargesheet cannot be said to be public documents under Section 74 of the Evidence Act, reliance placed upon Sections 74 & 76 of the Evidence Act is absolutely misplaced- Para 5 Right to Information Act 2005 - Copies of the chargesheet and the relevant documents along with the charge-sheet do not fall within Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act - Para 6  
The Supreme Court has held that the services rendered by an employee on work charge basis can not be considered for the grant of benefit of first time bound promotion if the employee is absorbed in service on a different payscale.A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice BV Nagarathna also observed that the benefit of Time Bound Promotion scheme shall be applicable when an employee... The Supreme Court has held that the services rendered by an employee on work charge basis can not be considered for the grant of benefit of first time bound promotion if the employee is absorbed in service on a different payscale. A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice BV Nagarathna also observed that the benefit of Time Bound Promotion scheme shall be applicable when an employee has worked for twelve years in the same post and in the same pay scale(The State of Maharashtra and another vs Madhukar Antu Patil). The Bench was considering a civil appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra challenging Bombay High Court's order upholding the order passed by Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai. The Tribunal through its order had set aside Government orders that down-graded the employee's pay scale and pension.  In the present case, the dispute was regarding whether the employee who was working as Technical Assistant on work charge basis from 1982 and was absorbed in the year 1989 on post of Civil Engineering Assistant with a different pay scale, would be entitled to Time Bound Promotion (TBP ) on completion of twelve years of service from 1982 or from the date of his absorption in the post of Civil Engineering Assistant. The Administrative Tribunal set aside the downgrading order and directed the grant of TBP reckoning his service from 1982. The High Court affirmed the Tribunal's order. Thus, the matter reached the Supreme Court at the instance of the State. While noting that the employee was absorbed on the newly created post of Civil Engineering Assistant which carried a different pay scale, the Supreme Court held that the contesting respondent will be entitled to the first TBP on completion of twelve years from the year 1989, i.e., from the date on which he was absorbed on the post of Civil Engineering Assistant and his pay scale and pension are to be revised accordingly. The Court has therefore quashed the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court as well as that of the Tribunal setting aside orders down-grading the pay scale and pension of the contesting respondent. The Bench has however directed that on re-fixation of Respondent's pay scale and pension, there will not be any recovery of the amount already paid to the respondent. This direction has been issued considering that the grant of first TBP considering his initial period of appointment of 1982 was not due to any misrepresentation by the contesting respondent and the same was granted on the approval of the Government and the Finance Department. The Bench observed that if the contesting respondent would have been absorbed on the same post of Technical Assistant on which he was serving on work charge basis, the position may have been different. With regard to the High Court's finding that the first TBP was granted on the approval of the Government and the Finance Department and the same cannot be modified or withdrawn, the Bench has observed that merely because the benefit of the first TBP was granted after the approval of the Department that cannot be a ground to continue the same. "At the outset, it is required to be noted and it is not in dispute that respondent no.1 was initially appointed on 11.05.1982 as a Technical Assistant on work charge basis. It is also not in dispute that thereafter he was absorbed in the year 1989 on the newly created post of Civil Engineering Assistant, which carried a different pay scale. Therefore, when the contesting respondent was absorbed in the year 1989 on the newly created post of Civil Engineering Assistant which carried a different pay scale, he shall be entitled to the first TBP on completion of twelve years of service from the date of his absorption in the post of Civil Engineering Assistant. The services rendered by the contesting respondent as Technical Assistant on work charge basis from 11.05.1982 could not have been considered for the grant of benefit of first TBP. If the contesting respondent would have been absorbed on the same post of Technical Assistant on which he was serving on work charge basis, the position may have been different. The benefit of TBP scheme shall be applicable when an employee has worked for twelve years in the same post and in the same pay scale", the bench observed.  Case Title: The State of Maharashtra and another vs Madhukar Antu Patil and another, CA 1985/2022

The Supreme Court observed that its single bench while hearing a Transfer Petition cannot invoke power under Article 142 of the Constitution to pass a decree for dissolving a marriage by mutual consent. In this case, the parties (husband and wife) to a transfer petition before the Supreme Court filed a joint application for divorce by mutual consent of the parties. They requested the court to invoke jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, and to dispense with the compliance of some of the procedural formalities and timeline contemplated in Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. The transfer petition was filed by the wife seeking transfer of the divorce petition filed by the husband from the Family Court, Pune, Maharashtra to the Principal Judge, Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh.  Single Bench Has Article 142 Powers Justice Aniruddha Bose observed that, since the provisions of Article 142 of the Constitution of India vests the Court with the jurisdiction to pass any order or decree to do complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, a Judge sitting singly has the power and jurisdiction to issue orders or pass decrees as specified in the said Article. The judge referred to recent judgment in Rhea Chakraborty vs. State of Bihar in this regard. "It would be evident from sub Clause (2) of Article 145 that subject to the provisions of Clause (3) thereof, rules made under the said Article may fix the minimum number of Judges who are to sit for any purpose and such rules may provide for the powers of Single Judges and Division Courts. The power or jurisdiction of a Single Judge is derived from the proviso to Order VI Rule (1) of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013. I have reproduced the said Rule in the preceding paragraph. The present petition for transfer comes within the domain or jurisdiction of the Judge sitting singly. Since the provisions of Article 142 of the Constitution of India vests this Court with the jurisdiction to pass any order or decree to do complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, a Judge sitting singly has the power and jurisdiction to issue orders or pass decrees as specified in the said Article.", the court noted. 'Annulment of marriage' Does Not Come Within Four Categories Mentioned In Proviso To Order VI Rule (1)SC Rules However, the court noted that, while a Single Judge of the Court can exercise jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this power or jurisdiction has to be confined to the four categories of cases referred to in the proviso to Order VI Rule (1) of the 2013 Rules only, or on subjects ancillary or directly relatable to them.  "Referring a case forming the core dispute in a transfer petition to mediation obviously comes within the subjects relatable to the lis pending before the Court. Annulment of marriage, however, in my view, cannot come within these four categories. I am of the view that while sitting singly this Court does not have the jurisdiction to take a decision on that plea made in the joint application. One of the preconditions for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in passing order or decree for doing complete justice is that the cause or the matter in which the Court intends to invoke the provisions thereof must be pending before it. Annulment of marriage cannot be linked to any cause or matter pending before this Court in the facts of the given case. The transfer petition arose out of matrimonial dispute between the parties, but the expression 'cause or matter pending before it' cannot be stretched to cover all disputes originating from such matrimonial problem that can be resolved by this Court, sitting singly, while hearing a transfer petition. I am not expressing any doubt on the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to pass decree to dissolve a marriage on consent of the parties without adhering to the timeline and other procedural formalities stipulated in Section 13B of the 1955 Act. But I do not think that while sitting singly, such a decree can be passed having regard to the provisions of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013.", the Court said. The court therefore observed that the joint application ought to be dealt with by a Bench comprising of two or more Judges.      
The Jharkhand High Court has quashed the merit list of the 6th Combined Civil service Examination, 2016 which was conducted by the State Public Service Commission (JPSC) to fill 326 positions.

The Jharkhand High Court has quashed the merit list of the 6th Combined Civil service Examination, 2016 which was conducted by the State Public Service Commission (JPSC) to fill 326 positions.  A Single Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi quashed the result upon noting that the merit list was not prepared by the JPSC by following the criteria of minimum qualifying marks in each paper.  "There is no doubt, the Commission is master of its working and the Courts normally are not entitled to question the mechanism of selection. But at the same time, if the illegality has been brought to the knowledge of the Court, the same cannot be ignored and the Court is bound to interfere," the judge observed. "The Public Service Commission have no power to relax the recruitment norms. In the case in hand, the JPSC deviated from the norms prescribed in the advertisement", the Court added. The Petitioners' contention was that the action of the JPSC in adding the total marks obtained by the candidates and not the minimum qualifying marks in each paper and the marks of Paper-I of General Hindi and General English while preparing the merit list is illegal  It was stated that the purpose of this paper is merely to test the working minimum working knowledge of the persons and not their merit otherwise.  The JPSC had admitted that marks of Paper-I were added in the merit list of the Mains examination, and that minimum qualifying marks of each paper were not taken into consideration and only total marks were considered for preparing the merit list.  Taking exception to this, the Court observed that JPSC does not have the power to relax the recruitment norms.  It has therefore directed JPSC to prepare a fresh merit list within 8 weeks, considering the minimum qualifying marks in each paper, and recommend the same to the Jharkhand Government within 4 weeks thereafter.   The competent authority of the State has been directed to issue appointment letters in favour of the successful candidates based upon the fresh merit list forthwith.  The High Court has also ordered the State Government to take appropriate action upon the Commission by fixing accountability and by taking appropriate legal action so that such illegality may not occur in the future and confidence of people upon the Commission may prevail.  The development comes in a batch of Petitions challenging the final appointment cum result of 6th Combined Civil Services Examination, 2016.  The Court allowed 5 (out of 15) writ petitions by quashing the final result of the Civil Services Examination. Consequently, appointment of 326 successful candidates, who were in service since June 2020, have been set aside. "The appointment to any public post must be absolutely transparent and fair and it must be in accordance with the prescribed procedure. Even ad-hoc appointment should not be encouraged as far as possible and should be adhered to only when public exigency required and appointment in accordance with the prescribed procedure would take a fairly long time and non-filling of the post would be against the public interest. Thus, Article 16 of the Constitution of India has been violated. If appointment is made without following the rules, the same being a nullity the question of confirmation of an employee upon the expiry of the purported period of probation would not arise", the Court observed.  "There is no doubt that after appearance in the examination, the candidates are not allowed to challenge the criteria as argued by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the JPSC, State and successful candidates. However, it is also well settled that a candidate by agreeing to participate in selection process only accepts the prescribed procedure and not the illegality in it. In a situation where a candidate alleges misconstruction of statutory rule and discriminating consequences arises therefrom, the same cannot be condoned merely because a candidate has partaken in it. The constitutional scheme is required to be followed",  Case Title: Rahul Kumar & Ors. v. State of Jharkhand    Read Order

The Delhi High Court has held that a special judge under the Prevention of Corruption Act is empowered to permit an officer below the rank of Inspector to assist the Investigating Officer in investigation. Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri added that the steps taken by such an officer have to be performed under direct supervision of the Investigation Officer, who remains in control of the investigation. The Court also clarified that the IO shall be responsible for all the steps that are taken by the subordinate officer. The Court was dealing with a petition seeking quashing of order dated February 7, 2020 passed by Special Judge wherein CBI's application seeking permission for Sub-Inspector to assist the main Investigating Officer in conducting investigation, was declined. The investigation pertained to commission of offences under Section 120-B read with Sections 420, 468, 471 and 477A IPC along with Sections 13(2) and 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against Bhushan Power and Steel Limited and others. It was alleged that the said company entered into a criminal conspiracy in order to cheat banks/financial institutions/Govt. exchequer, dishonestly and fraudulently diverted huge amount of bank funds. It was the case of CBI that being a high-ticket fraud requiring investigation all over the country, the application was moved before the Trial Court seeking permission for sub-inspector to assist IO in conducting investigation as the bank documents were voluminous and the investigation had to be conducted speedily. The respondents also did not object to the said application. However, the Trial Court denied such permission. Analyzing Section 17 (Persons authorised to investigate) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Court observed thus: "The Special Judge is empowered under Section 17 of the PC Act, 1988 to permit an officer below the requisite rank to assist the Investigating Officer in conducting investigation provided the steps taken by him are under direct supervision of the Investigation Officer who remains in control of the investigation and shall be responsible for all the steps that are taken by the subordinate officer." It relied on the Supreme Court's decision in HN Rishbud and Inder Singh v. State of Delhi, AIR 1955 SC 196, where after considering the Scheme of CrPC, it was observed that it is permissible for an officer in charge of a Police Station to get the investigation conducted from a subordinate officer provided that the responsibility of all such steps remains with the officer in charge of Police Station and that the subordinate officer reports all the steps taken by him to the officer in charge. In this backdrop, the High Court observed, "The Trial Court by passing the impugned order not only failed to appreciate the mandate of Section 17 of the PC Act, 1988 but also failed in its duty to follow the import of above referred exposition of law." Accordingly, the petition was allowed. Appearance: SPP Anupam S. Sharma along with Advocates Prakarsh Airan and Harpreet Kalsi appeared for CBI.  Advocates Manmeet Singh and Nishtha Chaturvedi appeared for the respondents. Case Title: CBI v.

Punjab and Haryana High Court, while dealing with a case where the petitioner questioned deletion of Rule 134A of the Haryana School Education Rules, 2003 on the ground that it was not laid before the House of the State Legislature for prior approval which is a requirement under Section 24 of the Haryana School Education Act, 1995, upheld the State Gazette Notification publishing such deletion.  The Bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli further noted that the as per Section 24 (3) of the Haryana School Education Act, 1995 laying of the Rules before the House of the State Legislature is not a provision requiring prior laying but the Rule has to be laid before the House of the State Legislature, soon after it is made.  Language of the provision is clear and when confronted with the same, learned senior counsel for the petitioner fairly concedes that the aforesaid provision stipulates and provides for laying of the Rule before the House of the State Legislature as soon as may be after it is made.  The court further noted above provision is directory and not mandatory and does not require prior laying of the Rule.  In such circumstances, as the provision of the Statute is directory and not mandatory and does not require prior laying of the Rule, it is evident that the notification dated 28.03.2022 (P-4) deleting the provision of Rule 134A from the Rules of 2003 has come into force from the date it has publication and as on date, Rule 134A does not exist on the Statute book.   The Court was dealing with a petition seeking issuance of directions to the Respondents to issue the Schedule for admission in Class 2nd - 8th under Rule 134A of the Rules of 2003 (amended in 2013) for the academic session 2022-2023.

The Delhi High Court has modified the conviction and sentence of a man from sec. 397 of Indian Penal Code to sec. 392 as the prosecution had failed to prove the use of a deadly weapon.

The Delhi High Court has modified the conviction and sentence of a man from sec. 397 of Indian Penal Code to sec. 392 as the prosecution had failed to prove the use of a deadly weapon.  Justice Mukta Gupta was of the view that the prosecution is required to prove the nature of the weapon of offence used specially in the case of knife or blade. "In the absence of the use of a deadly weapon being proved by the prosecution, the conviction of the appellant for offence punishable under Section 397 IPC cannot be sustained and is required to be modified to an offence punishable under Section 392 IPC," the Court said.  The Court also perused the nominal roll of the appellant which showed that he had undergone approximately 3 years and 9 months of sentence including remissions and that he was involved in four other FIRs including three FIRs relating to similar offences. "Consequently, the conviction of the appellant is altered to for an offence punishable under Section 392 IPC and the sentence of the appellant is modified to rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years," the Court said.  The Court was dealing with a plea filed by one Asif challenging the judgment dated 5th July, 2019 convicting him for offence punishable under sec. 397 IPC and the order on sentence dated 17th July, 2019 directing him to undergo sentence of seven years imprisonment. The FIR was registered under sec. 392, 397 and 34 of IPC on the statement of the complainant who stated that on 9th January, 2015 the appellant and a co-accused had committed robbery of his mobile phone from his possession by showing him a deadly weapon, that is the blade. The counsel for appellant had pointed out glaring contradictions in the testimonies of three prosecution witnesses who gave different versions in respect of the manner of commission of alleged robbery and the investigation carried out by the police qua the three witnesses. Perusing the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the Court said that it is trite law that even if the weapon of offence is shown after snatching had taken place for running away along with snatched article, offence under sec. 397 IPC is attracted.  It also noted that a theft is 'robbery' if, in order to committing of the theft or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.  "Thus, if the offender uses the deadly weapon at the time of committing robbery or dacoity which would include even the fear of instant death or instant hurt or wrongful restrain or an attempt to cause death or hurt or wrongful restraint even while carrying away or attempting to carry away the property obtained by theft, the act of the offender will fall within the four corners of Section 397 IPC," the Court said.  The Court therefore rejected the contention of counsel for the appellant that sec. 397 IPC is not made out as the blade was allegedly shown after the mobile phone was robbed.  "The decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant did not consider the necessary ingredients of an offence of robbery which in turn is a necessary ingredient of an offence punishable under Section 397 IPC," it noted.  Further noting that a pistol, revolver, sword, axe or even a knife are deadly weapons, the Court said that in the case of knife, the length of the knife, its sharpness and the pointed edge has to be seen to ascertain whether the knife is a deadly weapon or not. In the facts of the case, the Court took note of the fact that while the evidence of the prosecution was that the appellant took out a blade and kicked the complainant, in cross-examination it was stated that the blade was not a shaving blade. Therefore, the Court said that the kind of blade used was not proved even by the ocular evidence of the witnesses.  "Though it is not essential that the weapon of offence should be recovered to prove the nature of the weapon used and that a deadly weapon was used at the time of commission of the offence, however, the prosecution is required to prove the nature of the weapon of offence used specially in the case of knife or blade. Since from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses the size and sharpness of the blade is not proved, hence the prosecution has failed to prove that the appellant used a deadly weapon," the Court added.  With the aforesaid observations, the plea was disposed of.  Case Title: ASIF v. STATE (N.C.T OF DELHI) Inputs by Suhavi Arya

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that false assertions should be discouraged by parties while they come tot he Court seeking reliefs. The Court observed thus in connection with a case of a woman who hid her job details and her earnings in a maintenance plea filed by her under Section 125 of CrPC. The bench of Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi observed that the practice of making false assertions in court ought to be discouraged because the dignity and sanctity of the court is undermined by such conduct of a party to a lis. The case in brief Essentially, the petitioner-woman Ritu had moved the High Court against the order of the Court of Additional Principal Judge (Family Court), Ambala ordering an inquiry against the petitioner into an offence under Section 191 IPC punishable under Section 193 for concealing her income while seeking maintenance from her husband. During her deposition before the court, she maintained the same stand of having no income but when she was confronted with the record relating to her job, she admitted that she was working as an Assistant Professor on a monthly salary of Rs.28,000/- per month.  The petitioner took up the job on July 3, 2017 whereas she had moved an application under Section 125 Cr.PC on July 26, 2017 whereing she had stated that she does not have any source of income or property to support herself or her daughter. Her husband moved the court below arguing that the wife was legally bound to tell the truth but she made a false statement in her testimony, that she was not holding any job which she knew to be false.  Therefore, holding that she had given false evidence in the proceedings under Section 125 Cr.PC, the Court below came to the conclusion that it was expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry should be made for having committed an offence under Sections 191 IPC punishable under Section 193 IPC.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court opined that a petition under Section 125 Cr.PC is filed by a person who is unable to maintain herself or her children on account of lack of sufficient means and thus, the Court added, it becomes the foremost duty of the party claiming maintenance to disclose to the Court her actual financial status so as to enable the Court to come to a conclusion as to the quantum of maintenance to be paid, if any. Further, reverting to the facts of the case, the Court noted that the petitioner is working an Assistant Professor and is a highly educated person and still, at no stage of proceedings uptill her cross examination, did she disclose that she was employed including when her application for interim maintenance was decided and Rs.5000/- was awarded to her. "Assuming that the said fact was missing in her petition under Section 125 Cr.PC, the Court could have been informed during the course of proceedings that there had been change of circumstances regarding her obtaining employment. However, as has already been mentioned above, no such information was furnished and only the cross examination revealed her job and consequent salary. Thus it can safely be said that the possibility of her conviction was high and her actions were certainly deliberate and conscious to obtain maintenance," the Court held as it dismissed the plea moved by the woman-petitioner Case title - Smt.

The Supreme Court has observed that the intention of parties has to be looked into to consider whether a document is of absolute sale or mortgage by conditional sale.Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act defines the Mortgage by conditional sale as follows: "Where the mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property on condition that on default of payment of the mortgage-money on a... The Supreme Court has observed that the intention of parties has to be looked into to consider whether a document is of absolute sale or mortgage by conditional sale. Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act defines the Mortgage by conditional sale as follows:  "Where the mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property on condition that on default of payment of the mortgage-money on a certain date the sale shall become absolute, or on condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or on condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller, the transaction is called a mortgage by conditional sale and the mortgagee a mortgagee by conditional sale:" The proviso to this section states that no such transaction shall be deemed to be a mortgage, unless the condition is embodied in the document which effects or purports to effect the sale. In this case, the document executed between the parties had these clauses: (i) The plaintiff has borrowed a sum of Rs.3,000/- from the defendant for his household expenses in respect of the land which was in his possession. (ii) The possession of land was handed over to the defendant on the condition that the possession will be given back to him within one year from the date of conditional sale deed. (iii) The defendant is bound to retransfer the land to the plaintiff when he repays the amount of Rs.3,000/-. (iv) If the amount is not paid within the stipulated period, the conditional sale deed may be taken as a permanent one. "The intention of the parties has to be seen when the document is executed. It is not in dispute that the condition of retransfer is a part of the same document (Ex. 68). Such is the condition inserted by an amendment in the year 1929 expressed by the proviso of Section 58(c) of the Act.... Therefore, a reading of the document would show that the document was executed for the reason that the plaintiff has borrowed a sum of Rs.3,000/- for his household expenses and the defendant is bound to retransfer the land if the amount is paid within one year. The advance of loan and return thereof are part of the same document which creates a relationship of debtor and creditor. Thus, it would be covered by proviso in Section 58(c) of the Act. " the Court said while considering an appeal filed by the High Court which dismissed his suit for redemption of Mortgage. The defendant in this case relied on Vanchalabai Raghunath Ithape (Dead) by LR v. Shankarrao Baburao Bhilare  to contend that merely because of a term incorporated in the same document it cannot always be accepted that the transaction agreed between the parties was a mortgage transaction. The bench observed that, in view of earlier judgments in Umabai & Anr. v. Nilkanth Dhondiba Chavan (Dead) and Tulsi & Ors. v. Chandrika Prasad, the judgment in Vanchalbai cannot be treated as binding precedent.  Another argument raised by the defendant was that plaintiff has filed suit for redemption after 20 years of execution of the document. "The suit for redemption can be filed within 30 years from the date fixed for redemption. The period of 30 years would commence on 22.2.1969 and the suit was filed in the year 1989, which is within the period of limitation", the bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna observed. On the question of improvements to the property "Section 63 of the Act contemplates that any accession by the mortgagee, during the continuance of the mortgage, the mortgagor shall on redemption be entitled to such accession in the absence of a contract to the contrary. Under Section 63(a) of the Act, the liability of mortgagor to pay for improvement will arise if the mortgagee had to incur the costs to preserve the property from destruction or deterioration or was necessary to prevent the security from becoming insufficient or being made in compliance with the lawful order of any public servant or public authority. None of the eventualities arose in the present case compelling the mortgagor to pay for the improvements if any carried out by the mortgagee. A mortgagee spends such money as is necessary for the preservation of the mortgaged property for destruction, forfeiture or sale; for supporting the mortgagor's title to the property; for making his own title thereto good against the mortgagor; and when the mortgaged property is a renewable lease-hold, for the renewal of the lease, such expenditure incurred by the mortgagee can be added to the cost of improvements in the principal amount due. However, in the absence of any positive evidence of any improvement and the cost incurred, the defendants are not entitled to recover anything more than the mortgage amount. Since the possession was given to the mortgagee, he has enjoyed usufruct from the mortgage property which compensates not only of the user of the land but also improve16 ments made by him. The improvements were to enjoy the usufruct of the property mortgaged", it observed while allowing the appeal.

The Jharkhand High Court recently granted relief to the married daughter of a deceased employee who was denied compassionate employment by the Jharkhand Urja Vikash Nigam Limited.  Justice S. N. Pathak observed that the case is an example where the applicant for compassionate appointment was "discriminated" on the ground of gender.  The Petitioner submitted that the impugned order rejecting her claim suffers from gender bias, inasmuch as, if the son of the deceased employee comes within the zone of consideration for employment on compassionate ground, there is no reason as to why, the daughter, whether married or unmarried, should be excluded from the zone, if such daughter is fully dependent upon the deceased employee.  The Court was informed that the claim of the petitioner was rejected after more than four years from the date of submission of the application, that too only on the ground of her being married daughter. It was submitted that though the petitioner is presently married, but at the time of submission of her application for compassionate appointment, she was unmarried, fully dependent upon the income of her mother.   It was further submitted that it is for the fault of respondents, the matter was decided after a long delay of more than four years, and for this act of arbitrariness on the part of the respondents, the petitioner cannot be victimized or be deprived of her rights under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.  The counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that 'married daughters' do not come under the definition of dependent of the deceased employee and hence, no case is made out in favour of the petitioner.  The Court noted that the submission of Respondents that married daughter do not come with the definition of dependent of the deceased employee, is not tenable in view of law laid down by catena of judicial pronouncements of the High Court as well as of the Supreme Court. It referred to Madhubala Sinha Vs. M/s Central Coalfields Ltd & Ors.where it was held that held that when the brother of the deceased workman dying unmarried, if fully dependent upon the deceased employee, is entitled to be considered for appointment on compassionate ground, there is no reason as to why sister, whether married or unmarried, should be deprived of such benefits. Similarly, in Smt. Asha Pandey Vs. Coal India Ltd., the Supreme Court declared as void a policy excluding married daughter from consideration for dependent employment. The High Court accordingly directed respondent to consider the case of the petitioner for compassionate appointment in place of her deceased mother and pass appropriate orders for appointing her on compassionate ground, so that she could meet the situation of sudden death of sole bread-earner, who had left the family in penury and without means of livelihood.

The Gujarat High Court recently upheld the acquittal of a general store owner, who was booked under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, after noticing that the mandatory provisions relating to cleanliness of bottles in which the samples were collected, were not followed. Justice Ashokkumar Joshi observed that the Food Safety Officer himself admitted that the captioned bottles were not clean at the place of collecting the sample. He had also admitted that the covers of the bottles were not cleaned at the time. It said, "This Court is of the view that though the complainant had explained all the formalities for collecting the samples but, so longer as the mandatory provisions are concerned for cleanliness of bottles and also cleanliness of the cover is concerned, same is not proved. On the contrary admitted that the same is not cleaned and therefore...this Court is of the opinion that (trial) Court has given cogent and convincing reasons for acquitting the respondent, which learned APP has failed to dislodge them."  The brief facts of the case were that the Food Inspector, upon collecting a sample of Black pepper (whole) from the Accused's store found that there was mineral oil in the sample and the same was prohibited under Rule 44(AAA). Accordingly, the Accused was booked for offences under the Food Adulteration Act. However, later he was acquitted by the trial court which was challenged by the State in the instant criminal appeal.  The trial court had concluded that the Accused had followed all mandatory rules under the Act and that there was no breach of provision or violation of any rules. However, the State insisted that the trial court had not evaluated the oral evidence adduced by the Prosecution.  Per contra, the Accused argued that the Food Safety Officer had admitted that the captioned three bottled of the sample were not cleaned and therefore, there was a violation of the provisions of the Act. He also admitted that the said bottles had earlier contained groundnut oil and these were not cleaned before collecting the sample of the Black Pepper. Therefore, the Trial Court had rightly acquitted the accused.  The High Court referred to the scope of interference in acquittal appeals and opined that the Court must remember that prejudice lies in favour of the Accused in acquittal appeals. Further, if two reasonable conclusions are possible basis the evidence on record, the Appellate Court should not reverse the acquittal of the Accused unless there is some manifest illegality or perversity in the judgement. To bolster this view, the Single Judge relied on Mallikarjun Kodagali (Dead) represented through Legal Representatives v. State of Karnataka and Others, (2019) 2 SCC 752 and other precedents.  The Bench then emphasised that the sample bottles were not cleaned before collecting the sample even though it was mandated in the Act. The Court also pointed to the cross examination of the law officer where she stated that she had not taken the sample and she did not know the aspect of the complaint or the issue of collecting the samples.  Keeping this in view, the criminal appeal was dismissed.  Case No.: R/CR.A/1275/2015  Case Title: STATE OF GUJARAT v/s NIMESHBHAI VITTHALBHAI GANDHI

"Section 311 of... The Allahabad High Court has rejected an application filed under Section 482 of CrPC seeking to quash an order of the Additional Sessions Judge, Deoria rejecting two applications filed by the Applicant/accused under Section 311 of CrPC for recall of two prosecution witnesses. While doing so, Justice Sanjay Kumar Pachori shed light on the applicability of Section 311 CrPC.  "Section 311 of the Code gives a wide power to the court to summon a material witness or to examine a person present in court or to recall a witness already examined. It confers a wide discretion on the court to act as the exigencies of justice require. The word "just" cautions the court against taking any action which may result injustice either to the accused or to the prosecution," it observed. The Bench explained that the provision can be broadly divided into two parts: The first part of the Section has given discretion to the Court and enables it any stage of an inquiry, trial, or other proceedings under the Code, (a) to summon anyone as a witness, or (b) to examine any person in the Court, or (c) to recall and re-examine any person whose evidence has already been recorded. The second part of the Section is mandatory and imposes an obligation on the Court, to do one of aforesaid three things if the new evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.It opined that t he discretion given by the first part is very wide and its very width requires a corresponding caution on the part of the court. But the second part does not allow any discretion; it binds the court to examine fresh evidence and the only condition prescribed is that this evidence must be essential to the just decision of the case. Whether the new evidence is essential or not must of course depend on the facts of each case and has to be determined by the presiding Judge."…Where the court exercise the power under the second part, the inquiry cannot be as to whether the accused has brought anything suddenly or unexpectedly but whether the court is right in thinking that the new evidence is needed by it for a just decision of the case. If the court has acted without the requirements of a just decision, the action is open to criticism but if the court's action is supportable as being in aid of a just decision the action cannot be regarded as exceeding the jurisdiction."   In the instant case, the applications for recall of witnesses were filed by the Applicant/ accused about 4 years of recording the statement-in-chief of PW-1 and about one year of recording the examination-in-chief of PW-5. Noting that the trial of the present case is pending since 2015 and that the applicant shall have an opportunity to produce oral or documentary evidence with regard to the fact in dispute as the trial is pending for defence evidence, the Court opined that trial judge gave well-founded reasons for rejecting the applications. Reliance was placed on Natasa Singh v. CBI, (2013) 5 SCC 741, where it was stated that: "The scope and object of the provision is to enable the Court to determine the truth and to render a just decision after discovering all relevant facts and obtaining proper proof of such facts, to arrive at a just decision of the case...An application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. must not be allowed only to fill up a lacuna in the case of the prosecution, or of the defence." Similarly, in Swapan Kumar Chattarjee v CBI, (2019) 14 SCC 328, it was held that,  "Where the prosecution evidence has been closed long back and the reasons for nonexamination of the witness earlier are not satisfactory, the summoning of the witness at belated stage would cause great prejudice to the accused and should not be allowed. Similarly, the court should not encourage the filing of successive applications for recall of a witness under this provision."  In Rajaram Prasad Yadav v. State of Bihar, (2013) 14 SCC 461, it was held as follows: "The exercise of power under Section 311 Cr.PC. should be resorted to only with the object of finding out the truth or obtaining proper proof for such facts, which will lead to a just and correct decision of the case. The exercise of the said power cannot be dubbed as filling in a lacuna in a prosecution case, unless the facts and circumstances of the case make it apparent that the exercise of power by the Court would result in causing serious prejudice to the accused, resulting in miscarriage of justice. "Accordingly, stating that the applicant shall have an opportunity to produce oral or documentary evidence with regard to the fact in dispute and thus recall of witnesses is not necessary, the petition was dismissed.          
The Chennai Bench of ITAT has ruled that subscription money received in advance by the DTH operators is not taxable.  The Bench, consisting of members V. Durga Rao (Judicial Member) and Manoj Kumar Aggarwal (Accountant Member), held that the subscription money received by DTH operators is taxable only when the said amount is accrued to them, i.e., when the services are rendered by the DTH operators to the subscribers.  The assessee M/s Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd is a 'Direct To Home' (DTH) satellite platform operator and offers DTH services in India. The Assessing Officer (AO) proposed to make certain additions to assessee's income which was shown as 'deferred income' in assessee's accounts, for the relevant year. The assessee submitted before the AO that it's business model predominantly operated under a prepaid model and the assessee received subscription income from various customers in advance. The assessee contended that it treated the amount collected in advance as 'deferred income' and did not recognize the revenue on the basis of collection. The assessee added that thereafter, the income pertaining to a particular day was transferred from the 'deferred income account' to the 'subscription income account', which was then offered to tax.  The AO however rejected the submissions of the assessee and held that the assessee had no liability to refund the amount collected from the customers / subscribers in advance and therefore, the income had accrued to the assessee in the relevant year in which it was collected.  Against the order of the AO, the assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (CIT(A)). The CIT (A) observed that the Chennai Bench of the ITAT in the case of ACIT versus M/s Sun TV Network Ltd (2013), on an identical issue, had observed that there was no illegality or irregularity in the methodology adopted by the assessee in registering the revenue in the year of telecast of programme as against the year of receipt. Thus, the CIT(A) allowed the appeal of the assessee and directed the AO to delete the additions made to assessee's income. Against the order of the CIT(A), the revenue department filed an appeal before the ITAT.  The ITAT observed that the assessee provided DTH services to various subscribers and received subscription amount, which was credited to the 'deferred income account'. The ITAT noted that the revenue earned, for each day, was thereafter transferred to the subscription account and was offered to tax.  The ITAT ruled that this method of accounting, which was in line with the requirement of AS-9 issued by ICAI, had been consistently followed by the assessee.  The ITAT held that the cardinal principal of taxing the income under mercantile basis of accounting was that the income should have accrued to the assessee. The ITAT added that mere advances could not be brought to tax.   The ITAT ruled that the amount lying in the 'deferred income account' were advances received by the assessee for rendering services in the future. The ITAT held that unless the receipts were held to be taxable under the statute, the same could not be taxed. The ITAT added that only the income which has accrued to the assessee during the year could be taxed.  The ITAT held that the unearned revenue and mere advances, which would accrue to the assessee in future, cannot be clothed as the income of the assessee. The ITAT added that the fact that the subscription money collected in advance was never refunded to the subscribers, was not germane to the issue since the subscription money paid by the subscribers was governed by the contractual terms between the assessee and the subscribers.  The ITAT observed that a co-ordinate bench of ITAT Chennai in the case of ACIT versus M/s Sun TV Network Ltd (2013), had upheld the methodology adopted by the assessee in registering the revenue in the year of telecast of programme and not on the basis of receipt.  The ITAT thus dismissed the appeal of the revenue department.

The Allahabad High Court on Wednesday denied bail to a man accused of committing Rape by establishing a physical relationship with the Victim on a false promise to marry her and thereafter, threatening her to accept the Muslim religion. The Bench of Justice Om Prakash Tripathi was dealing with the bail plea of one Farhan Ahmad (Shanu) who contended that he is innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case only for the purpose of blackmailing. The Case in brief As per the prosecution's case, the informant/victim came in touch with the accused through facebook and the applicant-accused stated himself to be working at the post of Tax Inspector in Nagar Nigam Gorakhpur. Allegedly, during the conversation, he made a proposal of marriage and after giving assurance he developed physical relation, however, when she conceived, the accused pressurized her to abort the pregnancy, and thereafter, when the victim asked him to get married, he said that until and unless she accepts Islam, he wouldn't marry her. It has been further alleged that in October 2021, he came with one girl to meet her and started abusing her and used derogatory words and threatened her to accept Muslim Religion otherwise neither he would marry her nor he would accept her and she would be murdered. Agaisnt this backdrop, the victim lodged a First Information Report in the matter against the accused under Sections 376, 504, 506 IPC and 3/5 (1) U.P. Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2020. Contentions put forth The counsel for the applicant submitted that the alleged incident is said to have taken place at an unknown date and time i.e., in the month of January, 2021, whereas the FIR with regard to the same incident had been lodged after 10 months of the alleged incident without any plausible explanation for the delay in lodging of the FIR.  The main contention of the counsel for the applicant was that it is a matter of consensual relationship. Both the parties are major and there is no evidence of abortion. It was also contended that in the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., she admitted the love affair and relationship with the present applicant. On the other hand, the A.G.A. submitted that it is a heinous crime against society and has a long effect on the mind of victims. The victim had to go through serious emotional trauma and physical suffering.  Lastly, it was argued that Sexual intercourse with the victim on the pretext of false promise to marry is, and ought to be an offence of rape under the effect of the penal provisions on the mind of the victim.  Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, rival contention of counsel for the parties and perusal of record and considering the complicity of accused and serious allegation of rape against him, at this stage, without commenting on the merits of the case, the Court did not find it a fit case for bail.  Therefore, the bail application of Farhan Ahmad (Shanu) was rejected.   
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that in a criminal case when a graver offence is added, the accused who is on bail has an option of surrendering before the Court and apply for bail for newly added offence or even the investigating agency, on addition of a graver offence, has an option to proceed to arrest the accused but before doing so, it need to obtain a... The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that in a criminal case when a graver offence is added, the accused who is on bail has an option of surrendering before the Court and apply for bail for newly added offence or even the investigating agency, on addition of a graver offence, has an option to proceed to arrest the accused but before doing so, it need to obtain a fresh order of arrest against the accused from the Court that had granted the bail. The observation was made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in which the petitioner had challenged two orders passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Srinagar, whereby the petitioner had been charged for the offences under Sections 8/21, 22, 29, 27-A of NDPS Act and the other order whereby bail granted to the petitioner had been cancelled. The petitioner in his plea contended that there was no material on record of the challan laid against him that would show that he was involved in the alleged offences. Petitioner further contended that the material on record only suggests seizure of intermediate quantity of psychotropic substance from the petitioner's residence and not his involvement in the illegal drug trafficking. Lastly the petitioner also contended that it was not open to the trial court to withdraw the concession of bail to the petitioner, particularly when there was nothing on record to show that he had misused the concession granted to him.  Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that at the time of framing of charge even a strong suspicion against an accused would justify framing of charge and the Court at this stage is not required to see whether the accused can be finally held guilty of the offence but it has to see whether there exist sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused. The Court has to see whether, on the basis of material on record, ingredients constituting the alleged offences are, prima facie, made out, the bench underscored.  Applying law to the case at hand the bench recorded that,  "There is also material on record in the shape of bank transactions to show that the petitioner and co-accused were financing the illicit traffic of drugs. Thus, there is sufficient ground for presuming that the petitioner was in possession of drugs containing psychotropic  substances and was also a party of a criminal conspiracy to commit offences punishable under the NDPS Act. In these circumstances, the impugned order passed by the learned trial court whereby the petitioner has been charged for offences under Section 8/21/22/29/27-A of NDPS Act does not deserve to be interfered with" Dealing with the other contention of the petitioner that there was absolutely no material on record to show that the petitioner had either misused the concession of bail or violated any condition of bail and in these circumstances it was not open to the trial court to withdraw the concession of bail granted in favour of the petitioner, the bench observed that that at the time when bail was granted to the petitioner, the offence under Section 27-A of NDPS Act was not incorporated and it is only after investigation of case was complete that the aforesaid offence was found established against the petitioner and other co-accused. Elaborating the stated position of law on the subject the bench placed reliance on a Judgement of Supreme court in Pradeep Ram vs. State of Jharkhand and another, AIR 2019 wherein SC observed,  "When a graver offence is added, the accused who is on bail has an option of surrendering before the Court and apply for bail for newly added offence or even the investigating  agency, on addition of a graver offence, has an option to proceed to arrest the accused but before doing so, it need to obtain an order of arrest against the accused from the Court that had granted the bail" Deliberating further Justice Dhar observed that the petitioner, who was on bail, had been charged for a graver offence under Section 27-A of the NDPS Act and he has also been found to be a part of a larger criminal conspiracy as a consequence whereof he has been charged under Section 29 of the NDPS Act and when we take the total quantity of the mixture of drugs that have been recovered from all the accused who are part of the larger conspiracy, the quantity of psychotropic substance recovered falls within the category of commercial quantity and therefore the rigor of Section 37 of the NDPS Act to grant of bail gets attracted.  Upholding the trial court order the bench observed that the trial court, while cancelling bail of the petitioner, directed him to surrender before the SHO concerned or in the alternative to arrest him and send him to judicial custody, which cannot be termed to be either illegal or improper. The jurisdiction exercised by the trial court under Section 439(2) of the CrPC, in the instant case, is based on well-recognized principles of law and the same cannot be interfered with in exercise of revisional jurisdiction of this Court, Justice Dhar maintained. In view of the law discussed above the bench dismissed the petition.  Case Title : Tufail Ahmad Chota Vs State of J&K   
Dismissing petitions by 4 advocates challenging the Delhi government's order to wear masks as part of Covid-19 protocol even while travelling alone in a personal vehicle, the Delhi High Court today observed in a strongly worded order that, "Advocates as a class, owing to their legal training have a higher duty to show compliance especially in extenuating circumstances such as the... Dismissing petitions by 4 advocates challenging the Delhi government's order to wear masks as part of Covid-19 protocol even while travelling alone in a personal vehicle, the Delhi High Court today observed in a strongly worded order that, "Advocates as a class, owing to their legal training have a higher duty to show compliance especially in extenuating circumstances such as the pandemic. Wearing of masks cannot be made an ego issue."   The single judge bench of Justice Prathiba Singh pointed out that due to their legal training, advocates and lawyers were expected to aid measures to contain the pandemic rather than "questioning the same."  "Compliance by advocates and lawyers would encourage the general public to show greater inclination to comply. The duty of advocates and lawyers is of a greater magnitude, especially in the context of the pandemic for enforcement of directives, measures and guidelines issued under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act,  2005," the Court said.  The observations were made while delivering the verdict to 4 similar petitions filed by different advocates challenging the order for wearing of a mask in a personal vehicle even while travelling alone. While Adv. Saurabh Sharma challenged the imposition of a fine of Rs. 500 on him for violating the protocol, another petitioner, Adv. Sudesh Kumar complained that he was fined despite having his mouth and nose wrapped with a scarf while driving.  The petitioners took the stance that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare itself had not issued any such directions, and that in the absence of a law on the subject the imposition of such fines was ex-facie illegal and arbitrary.   The Ministry, during the hearing, however, submitted that health was a state subject under the Constitution and the final word on the issue would be of the Delhi Government.

The Supreme Court has permitted registration of those BS-IV vehicles whose sales were uploaded on e-Vahan portal before 31.03.2020 provided that the temporary/permanent registration was granted before the cut off date, i.e. 31.03.2020 The concerned transport authorities have however been directed to carefully scrutinize the records to ensure that the sales are genuine and have taken place prior to 31.03.2020. "The concerned transport authorities are directed to carefully scrutinize the records to ensure that the sales are genuine and have taken place prior to 31.03.2020", the Court directed. The direction has been passed in a set of applications filed by the owners/dealers of BS-IV vehicles where the sales of the vehicles have been registered on the e-Vahan portal and temporary/permanent registration was granted to these vehicles prior to 31.03.2020. "Sales of the vehicles which have been uploaded on e-Vahan portal before 31.03.2020 can be registered by the concerned transport authorities provided that the temporary/permanent registration was granted before the cut off date, i.e. 31.03.2020. The concerned transport authorities are directed to carefully scrutinize the records to ensure that the sales are genuine and have taken place prior to 31.03.2020", the order passed by a bench comprising Justice L Nageswara Rao, Justice BR Gavai and Justice BV Nagarathna stated. Court allows High Courts to entertain writ petitions for BS-IV registration    Modifying its earlier order, the Supreme Court has allowed High Courts to entertain writ petitions in relation to registration of BS-IV vehicles. On Tuesday (November 30), the Court modified its previous order dated 15th June 2020 in which it was made clear that no registration of any BS-IV vehicles can be made without the permission of this Court. The order has been modified to the effect that High Courts can entertain Writ Petitions for registration of BS IV vehicles purchased prior to 31.03.2020 and uploaded on the E-Vahan web-portal before that date. Registration of BS IV Vehicles Sold Prior To 31 March 2020 The Bench also permitted the registration of BS-IV vehicles which were sold prior to 31.03.2020 without insisting on the transactions being uploaded on e-Vahan portal in Manipur. The direction has been passed after perusing applications filed seeking a direction to the authorities of the State of Manipur to register BS-IV vehicles sold before 31.03.2020 whose registrations are not done.  The applicants submitted that the e-Vahan portal was started only on 28.09.2020 and one of the conditions for registration of BS-IV vehicles which were sold prior to 31.03.2020 is registration of sales on e-Vahan portal. The Bench accordingly directed the concerned authorities of the transport department of the State of Manipur to do a careful scrutiny to find out that the transactions are genuine and the sales were done prior to 31.03.2020. Clarification Regarding Vehicles in Delhi NCR Region: In an application filed by the Transport Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi, the Bench has clarified that all vehicles sold between 27th March 2020 to 31st March 2020 shall be registered provided the transactions have been uploaded on E-Vaahan Portal and the temporary or permanent registration was granted before the cut off date i.e. 31.03.2020. Registration Of BS-III compliant Oxytrucks To Supply Oxygen To Hospitals: The Bench also made an exception for 4 BS-III compliant Oxytrucks and allowed its registration after the Amicus Curiae submits that Oxytrucks were donated by Raytheon Technologies, Germany and they have been put to good use when the country was gasping for breath during the covid period. The Bench  allowed the application been filed by the State of Haryana seeking permission to register Euro III Compliant Oxytrucks to cater to the need of oxygen at different hospitals and directed the Transport Authorities to register the four Oxytrucks. Import Of Calcinated Pet Coke: The Bench has asked for the Commission for Air Quality Management's response to applications filed seeking permission to import calcinated pet coke for industries in addition to the quantity fixed by the Supreme Court. The top Court through its order dated 09.10.2018 had fixed a cap of 0.5 MT per annum on the total quantity of pet coke to be imported. The Bench has directed the Commission for Air Quality Management to submit a report within four weeks, regarding the impact on environment if these applications are allowed. Background: Supreme Court through its order on 13th August 2020 had granted a limited relief with respect to the registration of BS-IV vehicles, by allowing the registration of such vehicles which whose sale took place before March 31st but which could not be registered during lockdown in the month of March, 2020. "There are still stated to be a large number of sales which have been made and uploaded on the E-Vaahan Portal, even temporary registrations were made. Their registration during the lockdown period could not be made. Hence, we allow registration of such vehicles only which could not be registered during lockdown in the month of March, 2020 and for no other reason", ordered a bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari. Furthermore, the Supreme Court had clarified that the Order for allowing registration applied to the entire country, but not Delhi-NCR. It had been categorically laid down that there will be absolutely no registration of BS-IV vehicles in Delhi-NCR post-March 31, 2020. The Court elaborated that it had allowed registration of BS IV vehicles which had been sold in Indian before the nationwide lockdown, but could not be properly registered, as per procedure, due to the same. It was made amply clear that this relaxation in registration was being allowed only because of the lockdown and must not to be construed in any other way or used for any other purpose, or for the registration of any other vehicle which was not done due to other reasons. On July 31, the Court had recalled its March 27 order which allowed sale of 10% of unsold BS-IV vehicles for ten days after the lockdown, in areas except Delhi-NCR, after noting that the automobile dealers sold such vehicles during the lockdown in violation of the order. Following the recall of the order, the bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra held that such vehicles sold during lockdown should not be treated as sold, and that the consideration received should be refunded to the purchasers. The Court also ordered that no such vehicle sold after March 31 should be registered. "...the vehicles shall be treated to be with dealers as if they are not sold and consideration if any received shall be returned forthwith to the purchasers, no such vehicles sold after 31.03.2020 of BS-IV technology shall be registered", the bench had ordered then In July, Supreme Court also took exception to FADA's request to allow dealers to return unsold inventory to the manufacturers so that they could be exported to other countries. To put this in context, it must be noted that on March 27, the Top Court had permitted the sale of 10 per cent of unsold BS-IV vehicles to make up for six days lost due to the nationwide lockdown. However, on July 8, this Order was recalled on account of misuse of the Order, whereby more vehicles were sold than was permissible. As this was brought to the Court's notice, the Order was recalled, following which registration was banned on July 31. Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms are standards instituted by the government to regulate output of air pollutants from motor vehicles. The BS-IV norms have been enforced across the country since April 2017.  From April 1, 2020, BS-VI norms came into force. Case Title: MC Mehta vs Union of India      
While deciding the issue of negligence in a claim for motor accident , Supreme Court has observed that if any evidence before the Tribunal runs contrary to the contents in the First Information Report, the evidence which is recorded before the Tribunal has to be given weightage over the contents of the First Information Report."If any evidence before the Tribunal runs contrary to the contents... While deciding the issue of negligence in a claim for motor accident , Supreme Court has observed that if any evidence before the Tribunal runs contrary to the contents in the First Information Report, the evidence which is recorded before the Tribunal has to be given weightage over the contents of the First Information Report. "If any evidence before the Tribunal runs contrary to the contents in the First Information Report, the evidence which is recorded before the Tribunal has to be given weightage over the contents of the First Information Report", the Supreme Court held in the case National Insurance Company Ltd v. Chamundeswari and others. A Bench comprising Justice Subhash Reddy and Justice Hrishikesh Roy made this observation while delivering its verdict in an appeal filed by National Insurance Company against Madras High Court's order partly allowing plea filed by wife and son of the deceased who lost his life in a motor vehicle accident, and enhancing compensation to Rs.1,85,08,832. The observation was made by the Court while responding to Insurance Company's argument that in the First Information Report, it was mentioned that accident occurred only due to negligence by the deceased but such important documentary evidence was ignored by the High Court.  The Supreme Court noted that the eye witnesses of the accident in the present case were examined and had given their statements before the Tribunal and in view of such evidence on record, there is no reason to give weightage to the contents of the First Information Report.  Brief Facts:  The respondents in the present case are the wife and the minor son of the deceased who died in a road accident on 14.10.2013. According to them the accident happened when all of a sudden, the driver of Eicher van turned towards right side without giving any signal or indicator, and driver of the Maruti car died and they suffered injuries. In the Claim Petition moved by them before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, respondents claimed compensation of Rs.3 crores pleading negligence on part of the driver of Eicher van.  The Claims Tribunal through its order dated 11.12.2017 allowed the claim partly and awarded compensation of Rs.10,40,500 with a finding that there was a contributory negligence on the part of drivers of both the vehicles in ratio of 75% and 25% on the part of the deceased and the driver of Eicher van respectively. On appeal, the High Court recorded that accident occurred only due to the negligence of the driver of the Eicher van and awarded a total compensation of Rs.1,85,08,832. The appellant in the matter submitted that the Tribunal had correctly apportioned the negligence on the part of the deceased and the driver of Eicher van, but the same was overturned by the High Court, contrary to the evidence on record. It was contended that in the First Information Report, it was categorically mentioned that accident occurred only due to negligence by the deceased, and in spite of the same, such important documentary evidence is ignored by the High Court. The Supreme Court turned down the insurer's appeal observing that the evidence before the Tribunal has to be given weightage over the contents in the FIR.

The Supreme Court, while issuing directions to reduce delays in the execution proceedings, observed that an Executing Court must dispose of the Execution Proceedings within six months from the date of filing, which may be extended only by recording reasons in writing for such delay. The bench headed by former CJI SA Bobde asked the High Courts to reconsider and update all the Rules relating to Execution of Decrees, made under exercise of its powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and Section 122 of CPC, within one year of this order. "These directions are in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 read with Article 141 and Article 144 of the Constitution of India in larger public interest to subserve the process of justice so as to bring to an end the unnecessary ordeal of litigation faced by parties awaiting fruits of decree and in larger perspective affecting the faith of the litigants in the process of law.", the bench, also comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat observed. Till such Rules are brought into existence, the following directions shall remain enforceable: In suits relating to delivery of possession, the court must examine the parties to the suit under Order X in relation to third party interest and further exercise the power under Order XI Rule 14 asking parties to disclose and produce documents, upon oath, which are in possession of the parties including declaration pertaining to third party interest in such properties.  In appropriate cases, where the possession is not in dispute and not a question of fact for adjudication before the Court, the Court may appoint Commissioner to assess the accurate description and status of the property.  After examination of parties under Order X or production of documents under Order XI or receipt of commission report, the Court must add all necessary or proper parties to the suit, so as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and also make such joinder of cause of action in the same suit.Under Order XL Rule 1 of CPC, a Court Receiver can be appointed to monitor the status of the property in question as custodia legis for proper adjudication of the matter. The Court must, before passing the decree, pertaining to delivery of possession of a property ensure that the decree is unambiguous so as to not only contain clear description of the property but also having regard to the status of the property. In a money suit, the Court must invariably resort to Order XXI Rule 11, ensuring immediate execution of decree for payment of money on oral application.In a suit for payment of money, before settlement of issues, the defendant may be required to disclose his assets on oath, to the extent that he is being made liable in a suit. The Court may further, at any stage, in appropriate cases during the pendency of suit, using powers under Section 151 CPC, demand security to ensure satisfaction of any decree. The Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 47 or under Order XXI of CPC, must not issue notice on an application of third-party claiming rights in a mechanical manner. Further, the Court should refrain from entertaining any such application(s) that has already been considered by the Court while adjudicating the suit or which raises any such issue which otherwise could have been raised and determined during adjudication of suit if due diligence was exercised by the applicant.The Court should allow taking of evidence during the execution proceedings only in exceptional and rare cases where the question of fact could not be decided by resorting to any other expeditious method like appointment of Commissioner or calling for electronic materials including photographs or video with affidavits.  The Court must in appropriate cases where it finds the objection or resistance or claim to be frivolous or mala fide, resort to Sub-rule (2) of Rule 98 of Order XXI as well as grant compensatory costs in accordance with Section 35A.  Under section 60 of CPC the term "…in name of the judgment- debtor or by another person in trust for him or on his behalf" should be read liberally to incorporate any other person from whom he may have the ability to derive share, profit or property. The Executing Court must dispose of the Execution Proceedings within six months from the date of filing, which may be extended only by recording reasons in writing for such delay.  The Executing Court may on satisfaction of the fact that it is not possible to execute the decree without police assistance, direct the concerned Police Station to provide police assistance to such officials who are working towards execution of the decree. Further, in case an offence against the public servant while discharging his duties is brought to the knowledge of the Court, the same must be dealt stringently in accordance with law.  The Judicial Academies must prepare manuals and ensure continuous training through appropriate mediums to the Court personnel/staff executing the warrants, carrying out attachment and sale and any other official duties for executing orders issued by the Executing Courts. The court was considering an appeal arising out of an execution proceedings which is pending for over 14 years. While dismissing the appeals, the bench observed that these appeals portray the troubles of the decree holder in not being able to enjoy the fruits of litigation on account of inordinate delay caused during the process of execution of decree. The court said that there is steady rise of proceedings akin to a re-trial at the time of execution causing failure of realisation of fruits of decree and relief which the party seeks from the courts despite there being a decree in their favour. The court made following observations in this regard: There is steady rise of proceedings akin to a re-trial at the time of execution These provisions contemplate that for execution of decrees, Executing Court must not go beyond the decree. However, there is steady rise of proceedings akin to a re-trial at the time of execution causing failure of realisation of fruits of decree and relief which the party seeks from the courts despite there being a   decree in their favour. Experience has shown that various objections are filed before the Executing Court and the decree holder is deprived of the fruits of the litigation and the judgment debtor, in abuse of process of law, is allowed to benefit from the subject matter which he is otherwise not entitled to. Judgement debtor sometimes misuses the provisions of Order XXI Rule 2 and Order XXI Rule 11 to set up an oral plea The general practice prevailing in the subordinate courts is that invariably in all execution applications, the Courts first issue show cause notice asking the judgment debtor as to why the decree should not be executed as is given under Order XXI Rule 22 for certain class of cases. However, this is often misconstrued as the beginning of a new trial. For example, the judgement debtor sometimes misuses the provisions of Order XXI Rule 2 and Order XXI Rule 11 to set up an oral plea, which invariably leaves no option with the Court but to record oral evidence which may be frivolous. This drags the execution proceedings indefinitely.. This is anti-thesis to the scheme of Civil Procedure Code, which stipulates that in civil suit, all questions and issues that may arise, must be decided in one and the same trial. Order I and Order II which relate to Parties to Suits and Frame of Suits with the object of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings, provides for joinder of parties and joinder of cause of action so that common questions of law and facts could be decided at one go. Ensure that a clear, unambiguous, and executable decree is passed in any suit. We are of the opinion that to avoid controversies and multiple issues of a very vexed question emanating from the rights claimed by third parties, the Court must play an active role in deciding all such related issues to the subject matter during adjudication of the suit itself and ensure that a clear, unambiguous, and executable decree is passed in any suit.        
In a case of conflicting dying declarations, the Supreme Court relied on the one recorded after a medical examination with regard to the fitness of the deceased.The Court explained the "difficult question" before it as follows :"In the present case, we are faced with two dying declarations, which are totally inconsistent and contradictory to each other. Both are recorded by Judicial... In a case of conflicting dying declarations, the Supreme Court relied on the one recorded after a medical examination with regard to the fitness of the deceased. The Court explained the "difficult question" before it as follows : "In the present case, we are faced with two dying declarations, which are totally inconsistent and contradictory to each other. Both are recorded by Judicial Magistrates. A difficult question that we have to answer is which one of the dying declarations is to be believed". The bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice PS Narasimha opined that the court was required to examine as to whether a dying declaration was true and reliable; as to whether it had been recorded by a person at a time when the deceased was fit physically and mentally to make the declaration and; whether it had been made under any tutoring/duress/prompting.  In this case, the appellant approached the Court against a judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in which the High Court concurred with a judgment and order of conviction of the trial court against the appellant in an offence punishable under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  As per the prosecution, the wife of the accused-appellant, fed up with the appellants torture and constant demands of dowry, consumed a poisonous substance on 21st April 1998 and passed away.  The issue that arose in the case was that there were two dying declarations recorded by the deceased. The first dying declaration was recorded by Ms. Vani Gopal Sharma, Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Kurukshetra. In this declaration, the deceased stated that she was suffering from fever and since many medicines were lying on the Angithi, by mistake, she took a medicine of green colour. However, the day after the declaration was recorded, the parents of deceased Manjit Kaur reached the hospital and made a request for recording the statement of deceased Manjit Kaur under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. On such a request, Ms. Kanchan Nariala, Judical Magistrate, First Class, Kurukshetra recorded the statement of the deceased Manjit Kaur. As per this second dying declaration, the deceased stated that her husband had demanded Rs. 6 lakhs to go to USA and that the appellant as well as his parents administered a poisonous substance to her.  On the basis of the second dying declaration, FIR was registered. Charges came to be framed for the offence punishable under Section 304-B of the IPC. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court convicted the appellant under Section 304-B of the IPC. However, the trial court found that the other two accused, i.e., the parents of the appellant were entitled to get benefit of doubt and acquitted them. The appellant was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years. In an appeal preferred by the appellant before the High Court, while the High Court confirmed the conviction under Section 304-B of the IPC, it reduced the sentence awarded to 7 years. The appellant then approached the Supreme Court. Here, the court opined that it was required to examine as to whether a dying declaration was true and reliable; as to whether it had been recorded by a person at a time when the deceased was fit physically and mentally to make the declaration and; whether it had been made under any tutoring/duress/prompting. It noted that a dying declaration could be the sole basis for recording conviction and if it was found to be reliable and trustworthy, no corroboration was required.  The court further stated that in case there were multiple dying declarations and there existed inconsistencies between them, the dying declaration recorded by a higher officer like a Magistrate could be relied upon. However, this was with the condition that there was no circumstance giving rise to any suspicion about its truthfulness. The court opined that in case there were circumstances wherein the declaration was found to be not made voluntarily and was not supported by any other evidence, the Court was required to scrutinise the facts of the individual case very carefully and take a decision as to which of the declarations was worth relying upon.  In the present case, the court noted that there existed two dying declarations, which were totally inconsistent and contradictory to each other and both were recorded by Judicial Magistrates. However, it was found that while the first declaration was filed after the deceased was examined by a doctor to ensure that she was in a fit state of mind and conscious to make the statement; and was also endorsed by the doctor examining her, the same was not the case with the second declaration. The second declaration was recorded without there being examination by a doctor with regard to the fitness of the deceased. Further, the father and the sister of the deceased were present in the hospital during the recording of the second declaration. Thus, the court stated that the possibility of the second dying declaration being given after tutoring by the deceased's relatives could not be ruled out.  Accordingly, the court opined that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the first dying declaration would have to be considered to be more reliable and trustworthy as against the second one. The court further stated that– "Apart from that, it is to be noted that on the basis of very same evidence, the trial court, by giving benefit of doubt, has acquitted the father and mother of the appellant. In that view of the matter, conviction of the appellant on the very same evidence, in our view, was improper...The benefit of doubt which has been given to the other accused by the trial court, ought to have been equally given to the present appellant when the evidence was totally identical against all the three accused." The appellant was thus acquitted of all the charges.  CASE TITLE: MAKHAN SINGH v. THE STATE OF HARYANA | CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1290 OF 2010 Indian Evidence Act 1872 - Section 32- Dying Declaration - Case of two dying declarations, both contradictory, both recorded by judicial magistrates- Court relies on the dying declaration recorded after medical examination-(Para 16,17) Indian Evidence Act 1872- Dying Declaration - When can be relied upon - Conditions - It could thus be seen that the Court is required to examine as to whether the dying declaration is true and reliable; as to whether it has been recorded by a person at a time when the deceased was fit physically and mentally to make the declaration; as to whether it has been made under any tutoring/duress/prompting. The dying declaration can be the sole basis for recording conviction and if it is found reliable and trustworthy, no corroboration is required. In case there are multiple dying declarations and there are inconsistencies between them, the dying declaration recorded by the higher officer like a Magistrate can be relied upon. However, this is with the condition that there is no circumstance giving rise to any suspicion about its truthfulness. In case there are circumstances wherein the declaration has not been found to be made voluntarily and is not supported by any other evidence, the Court is required to scrutinize the facts of an individual case very carefully and take a decision as to which of the declarations is worth reliance.(Para 9)

While considering a SLP assailing Orissa High Court's order, the Supreme Court recently deprecated the High Court's action of disposing a writ petition without applying its mind to the grounds or challenge of submission. The Orissa High Court had dismissed the petition challenging the Orissa Administrative Tribunal's order by passing the following order,  "Heard learned counsel for the parties. By way of this writ petition, the petitioners have challenged the judgment and order dated 14.11.2012 passed by the Orissa Administrative Tribunal, Bhubaneswar in OA No. 163 of2008. Taking into consideration the opposite party is working for a period of three decades, it will not be appropriate for us to disturb the findings of the Tribunal.Accordingly, the writ petition stands dismissed. However, this will not be treated as precedent." While setting aside the High Court's judgement and remitting the proceedings back for a fresh decision, the bench in State of Orissa & Ors v. Prasanta Kumar Swain, the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna observed, "Ex facie, there has been no application of mind by the High Court to the grounds of challenge or to the submissions. In fact, the concluding line of the order of the High Court indicates that the decision will not be treated as a precedent. This was an inappropriate manner of disposing of a substantive petition under Article 226 of the Constitution since the High Court is duty bound to apply its mind to whether the judgment of the Tribunal is sustainable on facts and law." Considering that the proceedings before the Tribunal were instituted in 2008, the Top Court also requested the High Court for expeditiously disposing the case within a period of three months from the receipt of a copy of the order.  Case Title: State of Orissa & Ors v. Prasanta Kumar Swain| Civil Appeal No 154 of 2022 Coram: Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna       
The Supreme Court observed that the tendering of affidavits and undertakings containing false statement would amount to contempt of court. A person who makes a false statement before the Court and makes an attempt to deceive the Court, interferes with the administration of justice and is guilty of contempt of Court, the bench comprising Justices UU Lalit and PS Narasimha observed. Last year, the the Court had recalled an order granting custody of a child to a Kenyan citizen of Indian origin after finding that he had played fraud on the court and had approached it with "unclean hands" by suppressing material facts. It had also initiated contempt proceedings against one of the parties for having violated the undertakings. While considering this case, the court noticed an earlier decision on the question whether tendering of affidavits and undertakings containing false statement would amount to criminal contempt or not. Referring to ABCD v. Union of India, the court said: "15. It is thus well settled that a person who makes a false statement before the Court and makes an attempt to deceive the Court, interferes with the administration of justice and is guilty of contempt of Court. The extracted portion above clearly shows that in such circumstances, the Court not only has the inherent power but it would be failing in its duty if the alleged contemnor is not dealt with in contempt jurisdiction for abusing the process of the Court." The bench therefore held that Perry is guilty of having committed criminal contempt of Court apart from the contempt for violating express undertakings given to the Courts, including this Court. "Though the instant proceedings can be taken to logical conclusion and order of sentence can be awarded even in the absence of Perry, we give final opportunity to Perry to present himself before this Court on 22.07.2022 at 3.00 pm along with ....

The Calcutta High Court has held that private unaided educational institutions discharge public function under the Right to Education (RTE) Act and are therefore amenable to the Court's writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. "Such a public duty stands imposed, in my opinion, in terms of both Article 21A of the Constitution of India as well as the RTE Act which... The Calcutta High Court has held that private unaided educational institutions discharge public function under the Right to Education (RTE) Act and are therefore amenable to the Court's writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution.  "Such a public duty stands imposed, in my opinion, in terms of both Article 21A of the Constitution of India as well as the RTE Act which gave effect to the fundamental right in unequivocal terms," a Single Bench of Justice Shekhar B Saraf observed.  Reliance was placed on Marwari Balika Vidyalaya v. Asha Srivastava whereby the Supreme Court held as maintainable, a writ petition filed by a teacher against a private unaided educational institution, challenging the termination of her services.  The Court's attention was also drawn to a Full Bench decision rendered by the Allahabad High Court in Roychan Abraham v. State of UP, AIR 2019 All 96, where it was held that private institutions imparting education to students from the age of six years and onwards, including higher education perform a public duty; accordingly, such institutions become amenable to the writ jurisdiction.  Significantly, it has been clarified in the judgment that even if an authority is deemed to be a 'State' under Article 12 of the Constitution, the constitutional courts before issuing any writ, particularly that of mandamus, must satisfy that such impugned action of the authority concerned which is under challenge, forms a part of the public law as opposed to private law. (Reliance was placed on KK Saksena v. International Commission on Irrigation & Drainage, (2015) 4 SCC 670)  The development comes in a writ petition filed by Bineeta Patnaik Padhi, an educationist by profession, against termination of her services as the Principal of Army Public School at Panagarh whilst serving in her tenure as an extended probationer.  The school is operated by the Army Welfare Education Society and it was the argument of YJ Dastoor that since the said school was a private unaided school and the AWES which is managing it, is not a public body, in view of the mandate of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, neither the said school nor the society overseeing the affairs of the said school would be amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court.  Advocate Sonal Sinha, representing the Petitioner, argued that such termination was in violation of both her fundamental rights as well as certain statutory rights.  She stated that right to education is a fundamental right, thus all schools are discharge a public duty and consequently, are amenable to writ jurisdiction.  Reliance was placed on VR Rudani where the Supreme Court ruled that a writ of mandamus could lie to any person or authority performing a public duty and owing a positive obligation to the affected party, wherein such a duty need not be imposed by statute.  "While it is an admitted fact that the AWES operates all Army Public Schools across the country; the individual schools, as the said school in this case, have to conform to the statutory compliances of the RTE Act, WBRTE Rules…" she argued.  She also relied on Supreme Court's decision in DS Grewal v. Vimmi Joshi, (2009) 2 SCC 210, to stress that Army Public School is a public enterprise.  Based on the above submissions, the Single Bench ruled,  "what follows is the fact that even if AWES was considered to be a private body/authority, a writ of mandamus under Article 226 of the Constitution could be issued to the same if it were proved that it is performing a public duty and it owed a positive obligation to an affected party. The reason for such permissibility is the phraseology of Article 226 itself."  It added,  "A bare perusal of the schematics of the RTE Act, exhibits that the legislative intent of the Parliament was to ensure that teachers were not left in the lurch in situations and their grievances in school disputes, would have to be addressed satisfactorily. Specific provisions of the RTE Act lay down with utmost clarity, that compliance with the principles of natural justice are a must while specific grievance redressal mechanisms would be laid down by the 'appropriate government' as defined in the RTE Act."

The Tripura High court recently directed the State Government to pay a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- to a 28-year-old woman who was subjected to custodial torture in October 2021. The bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice S. G. Chattopadhyay was dealing with a suo moto case instituted by the High Court on a news report regarding the custodial torture inflicted on one Priyashi Datta (Debnath). The case in brief Before the Court, the State-counsel had contended that there was no proof of custodial torture on the victim in police lockup. It was argued that she was called to the Police station for interrogation in connection with a theft case and during interrogation, she fell ill for which, she was taken to AGMC and GBP hospital where she was given adequate medical treatment. The State counsel submits that the newspaper report about the custodial torture of the woman in police lockup is not true. On the other hand, the amicus curiae submitted that as per the statement of the victim, she was called to the police station on the basis of a false and unverified allegation of theft, and therein she was physically tortured in the name of interrogation It was further submitted that as per the medical report of the Medical Superintendent, AGMC and GBP hospital, Agartala, it has been clearly stated that abrasions were found over both buttocks of the victim after she was brought to the hospital on 26.10.2021 with a history of physical assault.  Consequently, Amicus argued that the materials available on record are sufficient to establish the fact that the victim woman was beaten in police custody, as a result of which, she suffered those injuries, and thus, it was urged that she be provided with adequate compensation besides issuing other directions as the Court may deem fit and appropriate. Court's observations Against this backdrop, taking into account the facts and circumstances presented before it, the Court concluded that merely on the basis of telephonic information received from a neighbor of the victim about her involvement in a theft case, police called her to the police station even without registering a case and without verifying the facts.  The Court further noted that from the medical reports available on record, it was established that she was physically assaulted during interrogation in police custody. The Court also stressed how the police officers are under obligation to protect the human rights of a person in custody and prevent all forms of atrocities against him/her. The Court further observed that the victim was not formally arrested by police but, undisputedly, she was detained in police custody for a considerable period of time for the purpose of interrogation, and therefore, she was entitled to all the safeguards provided under the guidelines issued in the case of D. K. Basu vs. State of West Bengal (1997) 1 SCC 416, however, she was deprived of those safeguards and she was tortured and maltreated in police custody. Consequently, the Court found the victim to be entitled to monetary compensation for the wrongs done to her and directed the State-respondents to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- (Two Lakh Fifty Thousand) to the victim Priyashi Datta (Debnath).

The Supreme Court has observed that anticipatory bail granted ignoring material aspects including the nature and gravity of the offence is liable to be cancelled.

The Supreme Court has observed that anticipatory bail granted ignoring material aspects including the nature and gravity of the offence is liable to be cancelled.  The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna in the present matter was hearing a criminal appeal assailing High Court's order granting anticipatory bail to the accused(s) in connection with a crime registered for offences punishable u/s 302 and 323 r/w 34 of IPC, 1860.   Top Court while setting aside the orders granting anticipatory bail observed that,   "The Court has to determine whether, on the basis of the material available at this stage, the High Court has applied the correct principles in allowing the applications for anticipatory bail. The offence is of a serious nature in which Vikas Singh was murdered. The FIR and the statements under Sections 161 and 164 of the CrPC indicate a specific role to Jogendra Singh and Suryabhan Singh in the crime. The order granting anticipatory bail has ignored material aspects, including the nature and gravity of the offence, and the specific allegations against Jogendra Singh and Suryabhan Singh. Hence, a sufficient case has been made out for cancelling the anticipatory bail granted by the High Court."  Factual Background   The appellant (Prashant Singh Rajput) on September 29, 2021, was at Negai Tiraha with the deceased (Vikas Singh) who was the appellant's brother in law and two other individuals, Rajkishore Rajput and Dharmender Patel. 4 accused(s) namely Ujiyar Singh, his two sons Chandrabhan Singh and Suryabhan Singh and his driver Jogendra Singh arrived in a jeep. Due to alleged rivalry, Ujiyar Singh and Chandrabhan Singh shot at Vikas Singh, while Jogendra Singh held him, leading to his death while Suryabhan Singh hit the appellant on his head with the butt of his gun, leading to an injury.   Upon being brought to a hospital, Vikas Singh was pronounced dead, following which the appellant registered an FIR under section 302 and 323 of IPC read with 34 of IPC, 1860.  In relation to the same incident, the accused (Ujiyar Singh) also registered an FIR on September 30, 2021 u/s 294, 506,323 and 34 of IPC against the deceased and the appellant.   Apprehending arrest, Jogendra Singh filed anticipatory bail application u/s 438 CrPC, 1973 during the investigation of the incident which was rejected on October 8, 2020.   Upon submission of final report u/s 173 CrPC as per which Ujiyar Singh and Chandrabhan Singh were named as accused but Jogendra Singh and Suryabhan Singh were stated to have no role in death since they were in Jabalpur 40 kms away from the spot where the incident occurred, the appellant filed a protest petition.  The investigation officer ("IO") on March 8, 2021 filed a supplementary challan pursuant to directions for further investigation by the Judicial Magistrate First Class. The challan stated that evidence had emerged showing the involvement of Ujiyar Singh and Chandrabhan Singh in the deceased's death. Hence, the JMFC in order dated March 10, 2021 observed that the IO had conducted an investigation only against Ujiyar Singh and Chandrabhan Singh, and had not properly considered the accusations against Suryabhan Singh and Jogendra Singh. Both of them were thus summoned.  Apprehending arrest, Suryabhan Singh and Jogendra Singh filed an anticipatory bail application before the Trial Court which was rejected and they thereafter approached the High Court.  Case Before High Court  The Single Judge of the Jabalpur bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court while allowing Jogendra Singh's anticipatory bail on July 1, 2021, noted that the investigation report did not reveal that Jogendra was present at the spot of crime.   Observing that the veracity of such a report could not be questioned at this stage, the Court held that even if he was present at the spot, there was no allegation against him of having fired at the deceased or having provoked the accused(s) to fire at the deceased.   While allowing Suryabhan Singh's anticipatory bail application on May 31, 2021, the High Court observed that the investigation report indicated that Suryabhan was not present at the spot of the incident. However, based on the statement of witnesses, the tower location of mobile numbers of the accused(s) and the CCTV footage, he was in Jabalpur. The High Court further held that the 'only' allegation against Suryabhan Singh was that he attacked the appellant, but that it only resulted in a simple injury.  Counsel's Submissions  Assailing the High Court's judgement, Advocate Uday Gupta appearing for the appellant submitted that the High Court ignored the FIR and the statements of the appellant and the other eye-witnesses according to which Jogendra Singh and Suryabhan Singh were present at the spot since the four accused had come together in a jeep, and each had a specific role in the crime. It was also his contention that the Single Judge has ignored the seriousness and gravity of the crime, as well as material aspects and hence, this Court, should cancel the anticipatory bail granted, in accordance with the principles laid down by this Court in Mahipal v. Rajesh Kumar (2020) 2 SCC 118, para 16.   Appearing for the accused Jogendra Singh, Advocate SK Gangele submitted that the IO's report showed that he was not present at the spot but was in Jabalpur. He also argued that the FIR registered at Ujiyar Singh's behest provided for an alternate explanation of the events that lead to the deceased's death.   Senior Advocate RC Mishra appearing for Suryabhan Singh averred that the FIR and the appellant's statement u/s 161, CrPC did not make any allegation of Suryabhan Singh having fired at the appellant prior to hitting him with a gun, while his statement under Section 164 of the CrPC made that claim for the first time. He further averred that no such empty cartridge was found and only the bullets in the body of the deceased had been recovered.  Advocate Abhinav Srivastava representing the State submitted that the crime was of a serious nature and that JMFC's order dated January 13, 2021 said that although Ujiyar Singh and Chandrabhan Singh had been arrested and kept in Judicial Custody, Jogendra and Suryabhan were absconding.  Supreme Court's Analysis  Relying on the principles of anticipatory bail laid down in the Judgements in Mahipal v. Rajesh Kumar (2020) 2 SCC 118, para 16 and Dr Naresh Kumar Mangla v Anita Agarwal and Others 2020 SCC Online SC 1031, the bench observed that the IO's report dated December 15, 2021, indicated prima facie case against Ujiyar Singh and Chandrabhan Singh.   "The supplementary challan dated 8 March 2021 indicates that more material had emerged during the course of investigation as against the events portrayed in the FIR registered at the behest of Ujiyar Singh. Hence, the case portrayed by the appellant could not have been ignored by solely relying on the counter-FIR," bench also noted.  Observing that the material at this stage could not be examined with a fine-tooth comb in the manner of a criminal trial, the bench in the judgement authored by Justice DY Chandrachud observed that,   "The High Court has placed reliance upon the report submitted under Section 173 of the CrPC on 15 December 2020 to hold that Jogendra Singh and Suryabhan Singh were not present when the incident occurred. However, the High Court has not addressed the clear deficiencies in the course of the investigation which have been highlighted in the order of the JMFC dated 13 February 2021 and the trial Court's order dated 24 March 2021. These are, inter alia: (i) the failure to notice eye-witness statements; (ii) reliance on CCTV footage for the period of time after the incident had occurred, ignoring prior or contemporaneous footage; (iii) not collecting CCTV footage between Jabalpur and the scene of offence; (iv) relying on CDRs without determining if Jogendra Singh and Suryabhan Singh had actually used the number; and (v) not conducting any fingerprint analysis."  The Bench thereafter, while allowing the appeal, also noted that the deficiencies in the investigation were noted by the trial court in the order dated March 24, 2021 but were overlooked by the Single Judge bench of the High Court.

In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court on Friday upheld the constitutional validity of Rule 135 of the RAW (Recruitment, Cadre and Services) Rules, 1975, which gives power to the Central government to voluntary retire RAW Officers whose identity is exposed or compromised. A bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari passed the order while hearing an appeal filed... In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court on Friday upheld the constitutional validity of Rule 135 of the RAW (Recruitment, Cadre and Services) Rules, 1975, which gives power to the Central government to voluntary retire RAW Officers whose identity is exposed or compromised.  A bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari passed the order while hearing an appeal filed by an ex-female employee of RAW, who had been compulsorily retired after she made allegations of sexual harassment against two senior officials of RAW.  The Petitioner had alleged that the Respondents had acted in a mala fide manner and the invocation of Rule 135 was an act of victimisation due to her refusal to accede to the illegitimate demands of her superiors.  She further submitted that Rule 135 itself should be struck off for being "vague".  With respect to the first allegation of malafides, the court held that it could not address the issue for non-joinder of necessary parties.  With respect to the other contention regarding validity of Rule 135, the bench held that the Rule is necessary to ensure safety of the organization as well as the employee whose identity has been exposed.  "Exposure of an intelligence officer could be hazardous not only for the Organisation but also for the officer concerned," the bench remarked.  Dispelling the argument that the Rule is vague, the court held that an employee working in the organization is certainly conscious of what constitutes "exposure of identity" and hence, there is no inherent vagueness in the impugned provision.  "In Indian constitutional jurisprudence, a duly enacted law cannot be struck down on the mere ground of vagueness unless such vagueness transcends in the realm of arbitrariness… challenge to Rule 135 on the ground of vagueness, 14 (1969) 1 SCC 475 35 could only be sustained if the Rule does not provide a person of ordinary intelligence with a reasonable opportunity to know the scope of the sphere in which the Rule would operate…A member working in the Organisation would certainly be aware of the transnational repercussions emerging from the exposure of the identity of an intelligence officer. Thus, there is no inherent vagueness or arbitrariness in the usage of above expressions so as to attach the vice of unconstitutionality to the Rule," it held.  On the issue of "non-prescription" of inquiry under Rule 135 before making the order of compulsory retirement, the Supreme Court held that the same does not go against the constitutionality of the Rule. It explained,  "The mandatory determination of what amounts to an exposure or what renders an employee unemployable due to reasons of security under Rule 135, is both a pre-condition and safeguard, and incorporates within its fold the subjective satisfaction of the competent authority in that regard. In order to reach its own satisfaction, the authority is free to seek information from its own sources."  As regards the allegations of sexual harassment, the Supreme Court recorded a finding that case was "improperly handled" and there was "denial of timely inquiry", thus subjecting the Petitioner to "insensitive and undignified circumstances".  Pertinently, RAW responded to the Petitioner's case by constituting a Complaints Committee in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Vishaka and Others v. State of Rajasthan and Others, after almost three months.  "The petitioner's complaints of sexual harassment were met with incidents showcasing procedural ignorance and casual attitude of her seniors in the department… The factual matrix of the present case is replete with lack of sensitivity on the part of Secretary (R) qua the complaint of sexual harassment. To wit, time taken to process the stated complaint and improper constitution of the first Complaints Committee (intended or unintended) in violation of the Vishaka Guidelines, constitute an appalling conglomeration of undignified treatment and violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner, more particularly Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution," the bench observed.  It thus ordered the Respondent, i.e. Union of India, to pay compensation worth Rs.1,00,000/-­ to the Petitioner for violation of her fundamental rights to life and dignity.  In this case, the bench also made certain significant observations with regard to the procedure of handling complaints of sexual harassment.  The Petitioner had contended that the Rules do not provide for sufficient participation to the victim of sexual harassment during the inquiry.  Dispelling this argument, the Supreme Court observed that the Petitioner seemed to have confused between "two separate inquiries conducted under two separate dispensations as one cohesive process".  It remarked, "legal machinery to deal with the complaints of sexual harassment at workplace is well delineated by the enactment of The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013 and the Rules framed thereunder."  The court explained that an inquiry is conducted under the above Act of 2013 is a separate inquiry of a "fact-finding nature". Post the conduct of a fact-finding inquiry, it explained, the matter goes before the department for a departmental inquiry under the relevant departmental rules and accordingly, action follows. It is in these departmental proceedings that the participation of the victim is restricted.  Elaborating on this aspect the court added,  "The said departmental inquiry is in the nature of an in-house mechanism wherein the participants are restricted and concerns of locus are strict and precise. The ambit of such inquiry is strictly confined between the delinquent employee and the concerned department having due regard to confidentiality of the procedure. The two inquiries cannot be mixed up with each other."  In conclusion, the court held,  Rule 135 is valid and does not suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality;The impugned order of compulsory retirement passed under Rule 135 against the appellant/petitioner is valid and legalThe Union of India is directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- to the Petitioner for violation of her fundamental rights to life and dignity as a result of the improper handling of her complaint of sexual harassment.The Petitioner is granted time to vacate and hand over peaceful possession of her official quarter for a period of three months.

The Telangana High Court has recently observed that the assurance given by some Ruling Party or by the Chief Minister or even by His Excellency the Governor does not become the law of the land.The assertion came from the bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A.Rajasheker Reddy while dismissing a clutch of petitions seeking retrospective implementation of the State... The Telangana High Court has recently observed that the assurance given by some Ruling Party or by the Chief Minister or even by His Excellency the Governor does not become the law of the land. The assertion came from the bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A.Rajasheker Reddy while dismissing a clutch of petitions seeking retrospective implementation of the State Government's decision to enhance the retirement age for government jobs from 58 or 60 years to 61 years. Background  Essentially, the State Legislature passed the Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) (Amendment) Act, 2021, under which the age of superannuation of public employees had been enhanced from 58 years to 61 years. This particular act did not contain the date of enforcement of the act, however, through a Government Order, the State Government, on March 30, 2021, notified that the said Act shall be deemed to have come into force on March 30th, 2021. This meant that the employees who were due to retire on March 30 or later, were entitled to the benefit of the Act passed by the state government. Challenging the Government order, some retired employees (prior to March 30) moved to the High Court. The submissions of the petitioners At the outset, the Petitioners argued that the employees who have superannuated prior to March 2021, had been discriminated against by the Government and therefore, they claimed that the Amending Act of 2021 and Government Order, are violative of Articles 14, 16, and 20 of the Constitution of India. They also argued that keeping in view the Pay Revision Commission's Report, the Amending Act should have been made applicable with retrospective effect i.e., from 31.12.2020. Significantly, the petitioners also contended that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Party had, in the year 2018, given an assurance at the time of elections for enhancing the age of superannuation of Telangana Government employees to 61 years and the matter was pending consideration. The petitioners further stated that the Governor of Telangana too, in a Republic Day Speech given in 2021, had made a promise in respect of enhancement of retirement age.  Against this backdrop, raising the issue of promissory estoppel, the petitioner's submitted that once a promise has been made by the State Government for enhancing the age of superannuation from 58 years to 61 years in the year 2018 at the time of Assembly Elections, the State Government cannot deny the benefit of enhancement in retirement age. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that the fixation of cut-off date does not warrant any interference as fixation of cut-off date always leaves a large number of employees unsatisfied. Further, noting that the petitioners have not been able to establish before this Court as to how it is discriminatory, arbitrary, or violative of Articles 14, 16, and 21 of the Constitution of India, the Court observed thus: "The assurance given by some Ruling Party or by the Chief Minister or even by His Excellency the Governor does not become the law of the land. It is the domain of the Legislature to enact an Act or to amend an Act and the same has rightly been done by the State Legislature by amending the Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) Act, 1984 with the Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) (Amendment) Act, 2021 (Act No.3 of 2021)." Regarding the issue of promissory estoppel, the Court referred to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. B.D.Singhal LL 2021 SC 297, wherein the Top Court had held that the enhancement of superannuation age is a policy matter. In this case, the Supreme Court had set aside a judgment of the Allahabad High Court which directed that retrospective effect from September 2002 should be given to the decision taken by the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) in September 2012 to enhance the retirement age of its employees from 58 to 60.  Allowing an appeal filed by the NOIDA against the judgment, a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah had observed that the High Court trenched upon a domain of executive policy regarding retirement age. "The infirmity in the judgment lies in the fact that the High Court has trenched upon the realm of policy making and has assumed to itself, jurisdiction over a matter which lies in the domain of the executive. Whether the age of superannuation should be increased and if so, the date from which this should be effected is a matter of policy into which the High Court ought not to have entered", the Bench had observed.  Read more about the case here: 'Enhancement Of Superannuation Age A Policy Matter' : Supreme Court Sets Aside Allahabad HC Direction On Retirement Age In NOIDA With this, the Telangana High Court didn't find any reason to interfere with the Amending Act No.3 of 2021 and the Government Order vide G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 30.03.2021, and to direct the State to grant the benefit of the Amending Act and the Government Order with retrospective effect and therefore, the writ pleas were dismissed. In July this year, the Delhi High Court had held that a promise or assurance given by the Chief Minister in a press conference amounts to an enforceable promise and that a CM is expected to exercise his authority to give effect to such a promise. A single-judge bench comprising of Justice Pratibha M Singh had observed thus: "The promise/assurance/representation given by the CM clearly amounts to an enforceable promise, the implementation of which ought to be considered by the Government. Good governance requires that promises made to citizens, by those who govern, are not broken, without valid and justifiable reasons." However, the Delhi High Court's division bench had, later on, temporarily stayed this order. Further, while upholding the detention of a man, accused of black marketing of Remdesivir injections amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Madhya Pradesh High Court had, in July 2021, observed that the social media posts of a Chief Minister can't be equated with an administrative order/instruction.  A Division Bench of Justices Sujoy Paul and Anil Verma had further held that it is not necessary that every social media post of a government functionary is seen/read out and followed in the administrative hierarchy.      
The Orissa High Court directed the Commissioner GST to issue clear instructions to all the officers in the GST Commission rates in the state not to issue any notice demanding payment of service tax/GST to practising lawyers."It appears that despite knowing fully well that advocates are not liable to pay service tax or GST, notices continue to be issued to them by the GST Commissionerate.... The Orissa High Court directed the Commissioner GST to issue clear instructions to all the officers in the GST Commission rates in the state not to issue any notice demanding payment of service tax/GST to practising lawyers. "It appears that despite knowing fully well that advocates are not liable to pay service tax or GST, notices continue to be issued to them by the GST Commissionerate. The Court expresses its concern that practising advocates should not have to face harassment on account of the Department issuing notices calling upon them to pay service tax/GST when they are exempted from doing so, and in the process also having to prove they are practising advocates." the bench comprising the Chief Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice B.P. Routray observed. The court was considering a writ petition filed by one lawyer Devi Prasad Tripathy challenging a notice issued to him. The bench perused the counter affidavit filed by Principal Commissioner GST in which it was stated that "after receiving information from Devi Prasad Tripathy having PAN as being an individual advocate practicing in the Hon'ble High Court of Odisha", further proceedings against him are dropped." "What the Court is concerned about is the deponent insisting that the Petitioner should have submitted "documentary evidence to prove his claim that he is a practicing individual lawyer and does not come under the provision of GST or service tax.", the bench observed. The court also heard other advocates present in the Court who stated that they too have received such notices.  Directing the Commissioner to issue instructions in this regard, the bench said that the copies of such instructions shall be placed before it. The case will be taken up on 22nd April.       
The Karnataka High Court has held that a female Hindu becomes the absolute owner of the property on acquisition of property by way of a partition deed agreed upon in the family and the property cannot be termed as acquisition by inheritance and thus would not revert to the siblings on her death.  A single judge bench of Justice C M Joshi sitting at Kalaburagi, allowed the appeal filed by Basangouda and set aside the orders of the trial and first appellate court which held that Section 15(2) of the Hindu Succession Act was attracted in respect of the suit property held by his deceased wife Eshwaramma allotted under a partition deed, and thus it would devolve back to her siblings.   The bench said “A combined reading of the interpretation of Section 15(2) of Hindu Succession Act coupled with the memorandum of partition, would go to show that the deceased Eshwaramma had become an absolute owner of the property and after her demise, the property would devolve by way of general succession under Section 15(1), but not as provided under Section 15(2) of the Act.”  Eshwaramma had acquired ownership over the suit property on the strength of the oral partition between her father and her brothers, which came to be recorded in a memorandum of partition and registered. Basangouda had filed a suit for declaration claiming that Eshwaramma was owner in possession of suit land and that after her issueless death, he became an exclusive legal heir.  Basangouda submitted there were some discrepancies in the mutation entries and as such the name of her brothers continued in the record of rights. Taking advantage of these hollow entries, the defendants started obstruction in peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit land, he alleged. The trial court however dismissed his suit for title declaration. The order was upheld by the first appellate court.  Basangouda argued that Eshwaramma had acquired the property on the basis of the registered memorandum of partition and by virtue of such partition, she had become absolute owner of the suit property. Thus such acquisition of property by Eshwaramma could not have been considered to be by way of inheritance. “Only if a female Hindu has inherited the property by way of succession, the exception carved out in Section 15(2) of Hindu Succession Act would come in play and it would not be applicable if the acquisition of the property by a female Hindu is by way of gift sale or such other modes,” it was argued.  The bench agreed that by registering the memorandum of partition, Eshwaramma and respondents had given effect to the partition entered into between them. "They have declared that the property fallen to their respective shares would be absolute property belonging to them and the rights and interests have also been relinquished. Such kind of oral partition recorded in the form of memorandum of partition is permissible under the Hindu Law,” it said. The Court held that acquisition of the property by virtue of Memorandum of Partition by Eshwaramma cannot be construed to be "inheritance" within the meaning of Section 15(2) of the Hindu Succession Act. "Though the provisions of Section 15(2) do not use the word intestate succession, the word used being inheritance, it has to be construed in the narrow sense..." The bench opined that the legislature has used the word inheritance in the light of intestate succession and Section 15(2) carved out an exception to the general rule mentioned in Section 15(1) of the Act. Therefore, the acquisition of the property by a female Hindu either by Will, Gift will also include the acquisition by way of a partition in the family. Further it said “Once there is a partition and properties have been divided by metes and bounds, it becomes the absolute property of such sharer. If the sharer had any surviving heirs at the time of partition, the property may become the joint family property of the acquirer and his family members. Therefore, the Ex.P1 cannot be construed to convey the property by way of inheritance at any stretch of imagination.”  Noting that the provisions of Section 15(2) of the Hindu Succession Act deal with inheritance from the parental family of a female Hindu, Court said such inheritance cannot be by virtue of an instrument, but by way of intestate succession only.  It added that the Courts below did not critically examine the provisions of Section 15(2) of the Hindu Succession Act vis-a-vis the Memorandum of Partition. "They went under the presumption that a partition deed does not create the rights, but it only recognizes that inheritance of the property. The inheritance of the property need not be the metes and bounds and only the rights are inherited. If it is testatory disposition in whatever mode it may be, it overrides the rule of intestate succession and therefore the impugned judgment is not sustainable under law.” Accordingly it allowed the appeal and declared the plaintiff to be the owner of the suit schedule property and consequently the defendants are restrained from interfering in the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit property by the plaintiff.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently granted regular bail to a woman booked under the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994, allegedly for accompanying the decoy witness to the place where the sex determination test was supposed to be conducted.  After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, role played by the petitioner, along with the fact that co-accused was already released on regular bail, the court deemed it appropriate to allow the instant petition releasing the petitioner on regular bail. It was alleged that one Babita and the co-accused Sukhwinder Kaur went alongwith the decoy customer in the car, where they met the petitioner, who is alleged to have taken money from Sukhwinder Kaur. The petitioner is stated to have led the decoy customer to the house where the sex determination test was to be conducted upon the decoy customer. The Petitioner contended that a sum of Rs.32,000/-, which was fixed as the cost for sex determination and was duly marked by the PNDT Team, was recovered from co-accused Sukhwinder Kaur. The role attributed to the petitioner is stated to be at par with co-accused Babita, who was already on bail. It was further contended that the petitioner was neither a technical nor a professional employee of the place where the sex determination test is alleged to have taken place. Consequently, the provisions of Section 23 of the PNDT Act would not get attracted to the petitioner.Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances noticed above, role attributed to the petitioner, as also the fact that other similarly placed co-accused Babita has already been granted the concession of regular bail by the Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Special Court to primarily try the cases of rape alongwith the offences of POCSO Act), Kurukshetra vide order dated 02.06.2022, I deem it appropriate to allow the instant petition.  The bench comprising Justice Vinod S Bhardwaj noted that the similarly placed co-accused named Babita has already been granted regular bail by the Fast Track Special Court.  Accordingly, the court while allowing the petition, ordered the petitioner to be released on regular bail. Court further made it clear that the petitioner shall not  threaten or influence any prosecution witnesses in any manner.  Case Title: DEEPA @ DEEPIKA Versus STATE OF HARYANA    
The Allahabad High Court on Monday, while denying bail to alleged Popular Front of India (PFI) leader Abdul Razaq Peediyakkal in the PMLA Case, observed that he can't claim parity with co-accused Siddique Kappan as Kappan is facing the allegation that Rs.5,000/- were transferred in the Bank account of co-accused Atikur Rahman, whereas in the instant case against Abdul, the proceed of crime is in crores. "So far as claim of parity with co-accused Sidhique Kappan is concerned, the role assigned to Sidhique Kappan is in respect of hatching a criminal conspiracy with K.A. Rauf Sherif. Except for the allegation that Rs.5,000/- were transferred in the Bank account of coaccused Atikur Rahman, there is no other transaction either in the Bank account of Sidhique Kappan or in the Bank account of the coaccused whereas the role of the present applicant is altogether different from that of co-accused," the bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan observed. It may be recalled that while granting bail to Kappan in connection with a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case in December 2022, the Allahabad High Court had taken note of the fact regarding this very allegation. Read more about Allahabad High Court's order here: Kappan Bail In PMLA Case| "No Other Transaction Alleged Except For ₹5K Received In Bank Account Of Co-Accused": Allahabad HC The case against Abdul As per the case of ED, during the PMLA investigation against PFI, it came to light that more than Rs.100 Crore have been deposited in the accounts of PFI and its related entities over the years through hawala/ underground channels and through remittances sent to the accounts of members/ activists/office bearers of PFI/CFI and other related organizations. Initially, the active participation of five accused persons came to notice through reliable pieces of evidence and materials who are: K.A. Rauf Sherif, Atikur Rehman, Masud Ahmed, Sidique Kappan, and Mohd. Alam. However, in further investigation, the name of the present applicant (Abdul Razaq Peediyakkal) came to the notice, therefore, in the supplementary complaint, the applicant was also made the accused stating that he is a PFI member based in Kerala and Abu Dhabi and is involved in the illegal act of collecting and laundering funds for radical activities of PFI.  The ED has also alleged that Peediyakkal was the largest shareholder of the Munnar Villa Vista Project (MVVP), which was set up allegedly with the motive to launder money collected from abroad and in India. He was arrested on March 2022 and booked under Sections 3, 4 & 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Seeking bail in the case, he moved to the High Court arguing that the case against him is not made out. It was also submitted that the main conspirator in terms of the complaint of the ED, namely, K.A. Rauf Sherif was enlarged on bail by the Special Court for PMLA Cases under the PMLA in Feb 2021. Further, it was also argued that since co-accused Sidhique Kappan has been enlarged on bail, therefore, the present application may also be enlarged on bail on the basis of principles of parity. Lastly, it was strongly argued that since the applicant was not named or not prosecuted for the predicate offence, his prosecution for money laundering won't be proper. On the other hand, the Counsel for ED Kuldeep Srivastava, while stressing the role of Abdul in the instant case argued that allegations against him are serious and if he is released on bail, he may abscond or may influence the trial proceedings as the trial is pending consideration before the trial court where the charges have been framed. Court's observations Taking into account these submissions, the Court, at the outset rejected the argument of the applicant that his prosecution for money laundering was illegal as he was not named or not prosecuted for the predicate offence. "It is clear that a person may not be involved in original criminal activity that had resulted in the generation of proceed of crime but he can join the main accused either as abettor or conspirator for committing the offence of money laundering by helping him in laundering the proceed of crime," the Court remarked as it referred to Bombay High Court's ruling in the case of Babulal Verma and Another Vs. Enforcement Directorate and Another, 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 392 Further, considering the facts and circumstances of the issue in question, the Court observed that the bail application also did not qualify the twin conditions of Section 45 of the PMLA inasmuch as at this stage it cannot be observed that the present applicant has not committed the offence for which the complaint has been filed against him. "The proceed of crime is also in crores. The applicant is based at Abu Dhabi. The factum of guilt can be proved or disproved before the learned trial court. Learned counsel for the E.D. has informed that the trial in the present case is going on with good pace and the same may likely be concluded very soon, therefore, I am not inclined to grant bail to the present applicant...," the Court observed. Consequently, rejecting the bail plea of Abdul, the Court directed the trial court to conclude the trial with an expedition, preferably within a period of six months by fixing a short date.

The Delhi High Court has held that the State was unjustified in restricting an individual's right to travel abroad by issuance of a Look Out Circular when it could not establish any evidence that the right would be 'detrimental to the economic interests of India'.

The Delhi High Court has held that the State was unjustified in restricting an individual's right to travel abroad by issuance of a Look Out Circular when it could not establish any evidence that the right would be 'detrimental to the economic interests of India'.  Justice Rekha Palli was hearing a Writ Petition filed by a businessperson of garment manufacturing based in Delhi to quash a Look Out Circular (LOC) issued against him by the Respondents, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Income Tax Department. The Court noted that the LOC had remained in force for almost three years, during which period, the respondents have admittedly not taken any further action against the petitioner. In such circumstances, it observed, "In my considered opinion, it would be wholly impermissible, for the respondents, to continue placing fetters on the petitioner's right to travel abroad, in such a routine and mechanical manner without due consideration of the fact that even after almost three years there is still no sufficient evidence to charge the petitioner under the Black Money Act 2015, Income Tax Act 1969, or the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002." It added, "even if the respondent's plea, that in view of the ongoing investigation regarding the petitioner's foreign interests, the issuance of the LOC in February, 2019 was justified, were to be accepted, the continuance of this LOC for almost three years without any cogent reasons forthcoming from them, is not understandable." Background  The Respondents had carried out search actions on the basis of a Warrant of Authorization at the Petitioner's residence and bank locker which led to their seizure of various assets including digital assets and jewellery worth Rs 1,00,67,181. At this stage the LOC was issued on the basis of purported undisclosed foreign assets liable for prosecution under Income Tax Act, Black Money (Undisclosed foreign income and assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.   Advocate Vikas Pahwa, counsel for the Petitioner, presented the deficiencies in Respondent's LOC. He pointed out that several search actions had been conducted at the Petitioner's residence for three years since February 2019, however till date no case was registered under the cited legislations. Further, the Petitioner had addressed the Respondent's concerns of Petitioner's undisclosed transactions in Dubai by furnishing certificates by the Government of Dubai testifying that neither the Petitioners nor any of his family members hold any assets in Dubai.  Respondents sought to quash the Petition by citing the limited role of courts in interfering with the administrative actions of the State in issuing an LOC. The LOC was following the authority's Office Memorandum stipulation that in exceptional circumstances a LOC may be issued against an individual where it appears to the authorities that the departure of such a person is 'detrimental to the economic interests of India'. The Respondents claimed that the seizure of assets from the Petitioner's residence coupled with a surreptitious purchase of 10% shares in a Dubai company in the name of his daughter, warranted sufficient appearance for such exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, the Petitioner was restricted from travelling abroad.   Countering the Respondent, the Petitioners pleaded that the LOC had only been issued on the basis of a draft agreement for investment confirmed by inconclusive Whatsapp chats indicating transfer of a sum of 1.65 million AED to an offshore company. In fact, only an amount of 7,50,000 AED was transferred by Petitioner's daughter to a Dubai-based sister concern of the company but the transaction had been returned through banking channels as the same had not materialized. Findings  Justice Palli rejected Respondent's stance pertaining to the role of judiciary in interfering with the issuance of LOC by the Respondents. While agreeing that the role is of a limited nature, she brushed aside the possibility of a blanket prohibition of judicial review. She stated that,   "In the light of the adverse effects that the issuance of LOC can have on an individual's life, the respondent's plea that the Writ Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India should not review the decision to issue LOC cannot be accepted. In fact, in case it is found that the decision of the authorities is without application of mind to the relevant factors, the Court can, and in fact, should come to the rescue of the individual".   Turning to the crux of the matter as to whether the LOC was actually justified, Justice Palli noted that by virtue of the OM, issuance of LOI could only be in exceptional circumstances. Since the impugned LOC was continued for 3 years without any proceedings under the penal law, the Respondents could not establish any judicial case against the Petitioner for curbing his right to travel abroad. Further, the case of the Respondent was based on a unsigned draft agreement and WhatsApp chats which was deemed inconclusive, as admitted by the Respondents. The Respondent's contention that it was awaiting response from Dubai's authorities to confirm its suspicions to initiate court proceedings also did not hold weight for issuing LOC as the Petitioner had produced certificates from the Govt of Dubai to the contrary.   In light of the fact that the Respondents had failed to substantiate its allegations of the Petitioner being involved in a huge financial scam, Justice Palli held that in the absence of cogent reasons and only suspicions, it would be impermissible to place fetters on the Petitioner right to travel abroad.  Further, the curtailment affected the Petitioner's business which involved overseas travel as an integral aspect. She stated that "the prolonged restriction would cause irreparable and considerable damage to the business interests of the Petitioner". Thus, the curtailment affected the Petitioner's right to livelihood as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution.   Finally, distinguishing Respondent's reliance of cases GSC Rao v. State of UP (2019) 106 ACC 437, Justice Palli noted that the same was inapplicable in the instant case as the same was on the basis that a criminal investigation was underway against the accused. Accordingly, Respondent's claim that the co-operation of the Petitioner could be ground for maintaining LOC fell flat as no such investigation was initiated by the Respondent.   Justice Palli, in its final remarks, allowed the Petition to quash the LOC, while placing a rider to the Petitioner to inform the Income Tax Authorities as to his details of foreign travel for a period of one year in the interests of justice for aiding the authority's investigation.   The excerpt of the Judgment reflecting the ratio of this judgment is reproduced below:   "issuance of a LOC is an extremely severe step and when purportedly issued in exceptional circumstances, on the ground of the departure of the person being 'detrimental to the economic interests of India', the authorities must tread with caution. Once this Clause is meant to be used in exceptional circumstances, it cannot be permitted to be used in such a mechanical manner, as in the present case."  Case Title: Vikas Chaudhary v. Union of India & Ors.;  Case No.: WPC 5374/2021 & CRL.M.(BAIL) 605/2021 (Suspension of LOC)    
Allahabad High Court on Monday issued certain guidelines/safeguards to prevent the misuse of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  One of the guidelines issued by the Court states that after the registration of a First Information Report (FIR) under 498A IPC, no arrest or coercive action should be taken against the accused during the cooling-off period of two months.  During this period, the Court has ordered that the issue should be referred to a Family Welfare Committee (FWC). It may be noted Section 498-A punishes a woman's husband or his relatives if they subject her to cruelty.  While issuing the safeguards, the Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi was of the view that the traditional fragrance of our age-old institution of marriage would completely evaporate over a period of time if gross and unmindful misuse of section 498-A IPC would keep on happening rampantly.  The case in brief  Essentially, the Court was hearing revision petitions filed by 3 persons (in-laws of the complainant) challenging an order of the Sessions court rejecting their discharge applications in connection with an offence registered against them including various sections of IPC including Section 498A.  This FIR had been lodged by the wife against her husband and in-laws, wherein she alleged, inter alia, that his father-in-law wanted to have sexual favors from her, and not only this, but her brother-in-law also have tried to ravish her physically.   She also alleged that her husband used to lock her in the bathroom after taking away her mobile phone and her mother-in-law and sister-in-law pressurized her to get aborted. On making their refusal, all the family members became physical with her.   It was further alleged that a constant demand was made for additional dowry and on her refusal, she was assaulted brutally by fists and kicks and maltreated and humiliated to its optimum.  Court's observations   At the outset, taking into account the story narrated in the FIR by the wife, the Court said that the FIR was not only abhorring, but full of dirt, filth, and venomous accusations against her own husband and in­laws.  "The graphic and vivid descriptions of the incident without any shame or hitch of any sort, speaks out the volume of mental condition and amount of venom and poison in the mind of the informant. She without mincing any word, rather exaggerating the incident to manifolds, had committed the snide before the Court," the Court remarked.  Further, the Court found no fault with the order of the lower court discharging the accused as the Court was of the view that the wife/victim had been unable to substantiate allegations made by her even at the time of investigation and these allegations were found false.  The Court also recorded its strongest exception to the type of language used by the informant in the FIR.   "The language of the FIR should be a decent one and no amount of atrocities faced by the informant would justify her to use such type of caustic expressions. FIR/complaint is the gateway of any criminal case even soft and decent expression would well communicate the alleged atrocities faced by her," the Court said.  Consequently, the revision petitions of the in-laws were allowed, however, Husband's revision plea was rejected.  Now, regarding the misuse of Section 498A IPC by the wife, the Court opined that nowadays, every matrimonial case is being exaggerated manifold with all the pungent and caustic allegations of dowry-related atrocities involving the husband and all family members  Thus, assessing the totality of the circumstances, object and the allegation of misuse of Section 498A IPC, the Court went on to propose the safeguards after taking the guidance from the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar Vs. Union of India with a view to keep the growing tendency in the masses to nail the husband and all family members by a general and sweeping allegations.  (i)No arrest or police action to nab the named accused persons shall be made after lodging of the FIR or complaints without concluding the "Cooling-Period" which is two months from the lodging of the FIR or the complaint. During this "Cooling-Period", the matter would be immediately referred to Family Welfare Committe(hereinafter referred to as FWC) in the each district.

The Delhi High Court has observed that in case of internet trademark infringements, the intent of foreign seated defendants to target Indian customers and market must be established.  Justice C Hari Shankar also observed that in such cases the interactivity should be coupled with an overt intent of the defendants to target customers in India. "The operation of the Trademarks Act and the CPC statutorily extend only to the boundaries of India. In the case of internet infringements, no doubt, the decision of the Court may, at times,operate against entities located outside India. That, too, however, would be subject to existence of the necessary connection between the activity of the foreign-seated defendants and India. More specifically, intent, of the defendants, to target India, must be established," the Court said.  Know The Controversy The development came while the Court was dealing with a suit filed by Tata Sons Private Limited seeking permanent injunction restraining the defendants from using the trademark "TATA". It was alleged that the defendants were using the said mark as part of the name under which their crypto currency was made available to the public on their website (www.hakunamatata.finance). The question which thus arose in the matter was "whether the plaintiff can seek an injunction against the defendants' mark, the defendants being located outside the sovereign borders of India and, therefore, statutorily outside the reach of the Trademarks Act, 1999, as well as the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC)?" What Did Tata Sons (Plaintiff) Argue? It was the plaintiff's case that the defendant's website had 50 visitors from India each day and that India was second in the list of countries with highest internet traffic on the site.  It was also argued that the Telegram page of Defendant indicated that it had several Indian followers or members. According to Tata Sons, the availability of the defendants' crypto currency under the marks "TATA coin/$TATA" adversely affected it's business and resulted in dilution of its goodwill.  Directions Can Only Be Issued Against Defendants Located Outside India If They Carry Infringing Acts Within Its Jurisdiction The Court observed that where the defendants are located outside India, the Court can issue directions against such defendants, if they are carrying out their infringing activities within the jurisdiction of the Court. "A somewhat more incisive approach is, however, required where the activity is carried out over the internet, as in the present case. A discernable line does exist, in such cases, between activities which would expose the defendants to the jurisdiction of this Court, and those which would not," the Court said.  "Mere accessibility of the website of the overseas defendants, by persons located within the jurisdiction of this Court, is not sufficient to clothe this Court with jurisdiction to act against the defendants. Interactivity of the website is, in such a case, essential. The extent to which the website would be interactive is also, however, relevant; mere interactivity would not suffice," it added.  Accessing Of Defendant's Website Cannot Constitute Ground For Court To Exercise Jurisdiction Over Defendants The Court therefore was of the view that accessing of the webpage of Defendant in the suit cannot constitute a ground for the Court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendants.  It was also observed that there was nothing to indicate that people had accessed the webpage from India. "The mere fact that the defendants' crypto currency can be purchased by customers located in India and that, as a result, the plaintiff's brand value may be diluted, even seeing cumulatively, cannot, therefore, in my view, justify this Court interfering with the defendants' activities, or with its brand or mark. In fact, the very applicability of the "effect" doctrine across sovereign boundaries may itself be a matter for debate; I do not, however, propose to tread that path in the present case," the Court added.  Observing that the Court cannot issue directions to the defendants for the reason of being outside it's territorial reach, the Court declined the prayer for interim relief.  Title: TATA SONS PRIVATE LIMITED v. HAKUNAMATATA TATA FOUNDERS & ORS   
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court observed that Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh are bound to adhere to the standards prescribed by the regulatory authority, National Medical Council such as infrastructural facilities, faculty etc. while setting up government medical colleges in the respective states. A Bench of Justices BR Gavai and CT Ravikumar made this observation while hearing a set of writ petitions challenging the decision of the Medical Council of India (now NMC) refusing to issue Letters of Permission to eight colleges, possessing a total of 800 seats, in the three states. In its order, the court added that the Centre as well as the NMC have ample powers to take steps, if there are deficiencies within the medical colleges. “The respondent states are bound to adhere to the standards prescribed by the regulatory authority, NMC. If there are any deficiencies, NMC and Centre have ample powers to take such steps as are permissible in law.” In June, 2018, the Court was informed by the three states, via affidavits that various steps were being taken to remove the deficiencies pointed out by the NMC. Based on that assurance, the court had granted permission to start the MBBS course in these medical colleges from the academic year 2018-2019 onwards. The Court had also directed the NMC to carry out inspections to check whether states have removed those deficiencies or not. In that hearing, the Bench had come down heavily on the three states for the poor infrastructure of their government medical colleges. These questions were posed to NMC during the hearing today. “You are satisfied that there are no deficiencies now?”, the Bench asked the Advocate Gaurav Sharma, appearing for the NMC. The advocate appearing for the Bihar said,  “We had filed an affidavit on how deficiencies have been removed. We are adhering to the timelines given (in the 2018 affidavit). There are no complaints now.” The Bench was prompted to close the matter after observing that NMC, after carrying out periodic inspections, noted that the deficiencies which were pointed out in the medical colleges have been rectified by the respective states. “Advocate Gaurav Sharma for MCI (now NMC) states that periodical inspections are being carried out with regard to the aforesaid medical colleges established by the three states. In that view of the matter, no purpose is served by keeping the matter pending.” With this, the Court added the all those students who were admitted during the 2018-2019 academic year should be treated as regular students.

A division bench comprising Justices UU Lalit and Vineet Saran observed that 'Royalty' has its basis in an agreement entered into between parties and has a nexus with the benefit or privilege conferred on a grantee. Tax is imposed under a statutory power without reference to any special benefit conferred on the payer of the tax. The judgment authored by Justice Lalit stated : "...the expression 'Royalty' has consistently been construed to be compensation paid for rights and privileges enjoyed by the grantee and normally has its genesis in the agreement entered into between the  grantor and the grantee. As against tax which is imposed under a statutory power without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payerof the tax, the royalty would be in terms of the agreement between the parties and normally has direct relationship with the benefit or privilege conferred upon the grantee". The Court made these observations while deciding a dispute raised by two companies from Kerala against the demand of royalty made by the Kerala State Electricity Board for allowing the companies to use the water released from hydel power plants to generate electricity for their own use. The companies had approached the Supreme Court appealing against the judgments of the Kerala High Court which rejected their claims. One of the arguments raised on behalf of the appellants was that the royality or charges for controlled supply of water in the instant case would be nothing but compulsory exaction and in the absence of any statutory sanction behind such imposition, the actions on part of the Board would be without jurisdiction. The counter submission on behalf of the State and the Board was that such royalty or charges had the genesis in respective contracts and as such the action on part of the Board was fully justified. To address this issue, the Court referred to the following precedents which discussed the difference between royalty and tax.  Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. and Others vs. State of Orissa and Others (1961) 2 SCR 537 State of West Bengal vs. Kesoram Industries Limited and Ors (2004) 10 SCC 201 State of Himachal Pradesh and Others vs. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. and Another (2005) 6 SCC 499Jindal Stainless Limited and another vs. State of Haryana and others (2017) 12 SCC 1Union of India and others vs. Motion Picture Association and others (1999) 6 SCC 150 The Court quoted from Justice Banumathi's judgment in Jindal Stainless Ltd case. "The essential characteristics of a tax are that:  (i) it is imposed under a statutory power without the taxpayer's consent and the payment is enforced by law;   (ii) it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax; and  (iii) it is part of the common burden". There is no element of "quid pro quo" in tax. In the light of the principles discussed in the precedents, the Court observed that the demand in the present cases cannot be considered as tax. "Whatever be the nomenclature, the charges for use of controlled release of water in the present cases were for the privilege enjoyed by INDSIL and CUMI. Like the case in Motion Picture Association31, the basis for such charges was directly in terms of, and under the arrangement entered into between the parties, though, not referable to any statutory  instrument. The controlled release of water made available to INDSIL and CUMI, has always gone a long way in helping them in generation of electricity. For such benefit or privilege conferred upon them, the Agreements arrived at between the parties contemplated payment of charges for such conferral of advantage. Such charges, in our view, were perfectly justified.  The submission that it was compulsory exaction and thus assumed the characteristics of a tax was completely incorrect and untenable. It was a pure and simple contractual relationship between the parties and the Division Bench was right in rejecting the submissions advanced by CUMI and INDSIL" The Court also rejected another argument raised by the companies that the contractual terms were arbitrary and discriminatory.

The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday upheld the legality of "bala sanyasa" and held that there was no legal bar against a minor becoming a swami. A division bench of Acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum delivered the judgment while dismissing a writ petition filed questioning the legality of appointing 16-year-old Aniruddha Saralathaya (now named as Vedavardhana Tirtha) as the Peetadhipathi of the Shiroor Mutt in Udupi. The bench read out the following extract from the judgment during today's pronouncement. "In other religions like Buddhism, children of tender age have become monks. There is no rule as to on which age sanyasa/bhiksha can be given. Also there is no statutory there no statutory much less constitutional bar on a person less than 18 years being initiated into sanyasa.  And religious text which have been quoted in the arguments of the amicus curiae makes it very clear that religion permits a person to become a sanyasi before he attain the age of 18 years and there is no such bar and as per the Respondent 6 was certainly empowered keeping in view the essential religious practices to appoint respondent 7 as the peetatdipati of the Shirur mutt.  In the concerned opinion, the courts are certainly not meant to write religious texts. However, they are under an obligation to follow the religious texts in the matters dealing with religious disputes and follow all practices which are prevalent in the religion, so long as they do not violate constitutional rights of individuals".  In the present case Shirur Mutt is a religious denomination and as per the essential religious practices, respondent 7 has become a sanyasi and he has been appointed as peetadhipati of the Shirur mutt. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination it can be presumed that the essential religious practices of the mutt is violative of constitutional rights". Dismissing the petition, the Court said : "The petition has not been able to make out violation of any statutory provisions or any violation of constitutional rights guaranteed to respondent 7. The essential religious practice has been going on since last 800 years and the appointment of pontiff is a practice which is existence for the last 800 years indicative of the philosophy and teaching of Sri Madhvacharya.    The division bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Aaarsh Marg Seva Trust and others vs state of Madhya Pradesh, WP No 8310/2019 has dealt with essential religious practices and in para 72 has held that "This is court is not a theological wizard and shall be transgressing its role as a constitutionist authority by interfeeing with the essential religious practices. Which is certainly not opposed to public order, morality, health or any other fundamental right.  In the light of aforesaid judgement, in which the divisions bench has declined to interfere in essential religious practices which was continuing since time immemorial, the question of interference of this court in the essential religious practice of Shri Shirrrur Mutt which is continuing for the last 800 years does not arise. Accordingly the petition is dismissed" Full copy of the judgment is awaited. The petitioner P. Lathavya Acharya, represented by Advocate D R Ravishankar, had argued that forcing a minor to do "material abandonment" was in violation of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. "A minor cannot be forced with doing what is not suiting his age. Anointing a minor as chief pontiff amounts to imposing material abandonment on the child, which is in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. In substance, there cannot be a sannyasa because that will require him (minor) to include material abandonment", the petitioner had argued. The petitioner argued that "bala sanyasa" was akin to child labour. To resolve the issue, the Court had appointed Senior Advocate S S Naganand as an amicus curiae, who opined that there was no legal bar against a minor becoming a swami. "There is no statutory, much less constitutional, bar on a person of less than 18 years age being initiated into Sanyasa. It is impossible, and also inappropriate, to generalise the issue and each case will have to be seen in the factual context involved". Further, the amicus said "In the event of the head of one of the Mutts passing away without nominating his successor, the head of the paired Mutt has the authority to appoint such successor. This custom has found judicial recognition by way of a judgement of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court in the case of Bheemanakatte Mutt, AIR 1917 Mad 809. A seven-judge bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in  AIR 1954 AIR 282 (Shiur Muttcase)  has declared that the followers of Madhwacharya constitute a religious denomination and the followers of Shiroor Mutt form a section of the religious denomination."   As regards Bal-sanyasa, he submitted, "The age of majority is reckoned as 18 years only for purposes of entering into a binding contract and undertaking responsibilities as majors. This is the purpose for which the Majority Act, 1875 was enacted. While prescribing the age of majority as 18 years for this purpose, a specific exception is carved out in section 2 which says that nothing contained in the Act shall affect the religion or religious rites and usages of any class of citizens of India..." "Therefore, for purposes of religion or religious rites and usages that have the protection of the Constitution as also international treaties, a person cannot be presumed to be a minor only for the reason that he is less than 18 years of age. When the question arises whether any of the rights of such a person is violated, it has to be examined in the totality of circumstances and it may not be appropriate to proceed on the presumption that he is a minor for all purposes."  Further, it was said "Among the followers of Madhwacharya in the Udupi region, particularly the Ashta Mathas, the practice is to give Sanyasa Deeksha only to a Brahmachari (unmarried,celibate). There is, however, no inflexible rule that a person has to be of a certain age. It is not necessary that only boys of a tender age are to be initiated into Sanyasa."  Also, it was said, "If the person so initiated happens to be of less than 18 years of age, it is only coincidental. There is no rule of Bala Sanyasa. There is no compulsion or force involved in the matter of Sanyasa. Unless the person concerned and his parents consent wholeheartedly, Sanyasa Deeksha will not be given. There is nothing like the imposition of Sanyasa on a child."  The state government counsel also opposed the petition on grounds of maintainability. It was said "A declaration has been sought using public law remedy, while private law remedy has to be invoked. The question of declaration seeking that respondent 6 has no authority to appoint bala-sanyasi, that under Article 226 is not permissible. On the other hand, counsel appearing for the respondents 5 and 6 (Sode Vadiraja Mutt and Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha swami of Sri Sode Vadiraj Mutt ) submitted that "The previous head (pontiff) died in 2018, the office was kept vacant they did not find a suitable person. Eventually, when they located this boy after looking at his interest in Dharmashastra and all associated activities with spiritual science, he was chosen by Respondent 6, as a fit candidate."  Further, it was said that "This practise of Bala-sanyasa has been there since 800 odd years. All the Astha mathas from their inception have had bala-sanyasi as peethadhipathis, who have efficiently and successfully managed and administered Sri Krishna Matha and their respective Astha Matha's."  Moreover, it was said for 18 months there was no quarrel as regards the administration of the affairs of the mutt. Only these four persons have come before the court, questioning the appointment of resp 7. There is no public interest involved in the present case, apart from these petitioners no followers of the Shirur mutt have come forward with any complaint on the anointment.  It was claimed that "Prior to the present petition, the same petitioners have filed a criminal complaint against the respondent 6 alleging misappropriation of funds, the trial court has rejected the complaint, having failed there the petitioners have come before this court. This petition is to settle scores with resp 6."  The counsel also submitted that:  "Your (petitioners) right to profess religion is not affected by my appointment of resp 7. Moreover, if somebody wants to become celibate at the age of 16 years, law does not prevent it." In regards to the submission that fundamental rights of the minor will be affected the counsel for respondent said "The appointment of Peedathipathi of Shiroor Mutt is also well within the policies formulated by the Central government from time to time including the National Policy for Children, 2013."  The counsel for the respondents added,  "As Peedathipathi of the Shri Shiroor Matha, he is not denied or deprived of any of his rights flowing to him under the above-mentioned laws or policies. The Peedathipathi pursues his education by learning the Vedas, Upanishads, philosophy of Shriman Madhwacharya to do which he had always shown keen interest, profound love and desire. He is not abused or forced to do any avocations unsuited to his age or strength nor is he forced to carry out the duties attached to the post of a Peedathipathi owing to any economic necessity or need. In Shri Shiroor Matha, he has all the opportunity and facilities for wholesome development of his person and personality in a conducive environment," It was also said that "Even the Constitution of India mandates state governments to provide every child education up to 14 years. The mutts impart education and they (pontiff) are taught everything associated with Hindu religion and philosophy."  Reference was also made to the fact that "Shriman Madhwaharya himself was a bal sanyasi and was initiated into sanyasa at the age of 11 years by his teacher Shri Achyuta Prekshacharya."(Report to be updated after receiving full copy of the judgment) Case Title: P Lathavya Acharya And State Of Karnataka   Case No: WP 8926/2021  
The Orissa High Court has come down heavily on the Tahasildar, Chatrapur, in Ganjam district for "lackadaisical attitude" and inaction on his part to consider the application of an octogenarian Indo-Pak war-widow to re-issue the records of her land which she lost due to the 1999 super-cyclone.  Single Judge Bench of Justice Biswanath Rath said, “…this Court finding this to be a fit case while expressing its anxiety in the inaction of the Tahasildar, Chatrapur for over two months involving such serious issues recording the Tahasildar failed in appreciating this not an ordinary case put up before him and the case involves a War-Widow whose husband has lost his life for the Nation requesting early attention to such issues.” Brief Facts The husband of the petitioner, Late Lance Naik M. Chineya was killed in action while taking part in the Indo-Pak War of 1971, leaving behind his widow and two minor children. The petitioner was allotted a piece of land by the Government as per the prevailing scheme for war-widows.  The Patta granted in her favour for the land got destroyed in the super-cyclone. Therefore, she repeatedly approached the Tahasildar, Chatrapur followed by a representation to the District Collector, Ganjam on 11.11.2022. However, to her utter disappointment, she received no response from the authorities. Thus, she approached the High Court seeking appropriate directions. Submissions of Parties J.K. Naik, counsel for the petitioner submitted that early steps must have been taken considering the status of the petitioner. He expressed anguish over the fact that the petitioner was compelled to approach the High Court for necessary directions due to inaction of the authorities concerned, including the District Collector. U.K. Sahoo, Additional Standing Counsel for State, also agreed that once a detailed representation is already made to the Tahasildar, he was duty-bound to reach a decision. He conceded to the argument that considering status of the petitioner being a war-widow, the authorities should have attended to her case promptly.  Court’s Observations The Court, at the outset, expressed discontentment over the inaction of the Tahasildar. It directed him to undertake the necessary exercise promptly and if required, to trace out the order of land allotment to the petitioner from the official records. “…further if there is involvement of the War-Widow is necessary, then the Tahasildar himself may visit the residence of the War-Widow already aged 80 years involved herein instead of troubling her to come to his Office to find out all sorts of solutions involved therein.” The Court directed the Tahasildar to complete the search for the record within a period of fifteen days and also clarified that even if the authority fails to find out any material suggesting allotment of the land to the petitioner, a decision would be taken regarding the right over the land and record of rights to be prepared to that effect within one and half months. “Since the Petitioner claims to be in possession of the particular property for over several decades, in the event there is no material available establishing allotment in favour of the Petitioner, there should be a decision in deciding the land in her occupation and there should be preparation of Record of Rights accordingly,” the Court added. Having due regard for the gravity of the matter, the Court directed the District Collector to monitor the case and to submit a compliance report within two months.  Case Title: M. Rajamma v.

The Supreme Court observed that a High Court can quash criminal proceedings in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., even if the offences are non-compoundable and the compromise is reached after conviction. The bench headed by CJI NV Ramana added that criminal proceedings involving non-­heinous offences or where the offences are predominantly of a private nature, can be quashed irrespective of the fact that trial has already been concluded or appeal stands dismissed against conviction. Where compromise is struck post-conviction, the High Court ought to exercise such discretion with rectitude, keeping in view the circumstances surrounding the incident, the court said. In this case, the accused who were convicted under Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code, in their revision petition, sought compounding of offence in light of the compromise. The High Court rejected their plea on the ground that the offences are non-compoundable. In appeal, the Apex Court bench also comprising Justice Surya Kant noted the scope of Section 320 CrPC : 11. True it is that offences which are 'non­compoundable' cannot be compounded by a criminal court in purported exercise of its powers under Section 320 Cr.P.C. Any such attempt by the court would amount to alteration, addition and modification of Section 320 Cr.P.C, which is the exclusive domain of Legislature. There is no patent or latent ambiguity in the language of Section 320 Cr.P.C., which may justify its wider interpretation and include such offences in the docket of 'compoundable' offences which have been consciously kept out as non­compoundable. Nevertheless, the limited jurisdiction to compound an offence within the framework of Section 320 Cr.P.C. is not an embargo against invoking inherent powers by the High Court vested in it under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The High Court, keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of a case and for justifiable reasons can press Section 482 Cr.P.C. in aid to prevent abuse of the process of any Court and/or to secure the ends of justice. But the court observed that the High Court could quash such proceedings in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., even if the offences are non-compoundable. It made these observations: Consequential effects of the offence beyond the body of an individual 12...The High Court can indubitably evaluate the consequential effects of the offence beyond the body of an individual and thereafter adopt a pragmatic approach, to ensure that the felony, even if goes unpunished, does not tinker with or paralyze the very object of the administration of criminal justice system. Handing out punishment is not the sole form of delivering justice 13. It appears to us that criminal proceedings involving non­heinous offences or where the offences are pre­dominantly of a private nature, can be annulled irrespective of the fact that trial has already been concluded or appeal stands dismissed against conviction. Handing out punishment is not the sole form of delivering justice. Societal method of applying laws evenly is always subject to lawful exceptions. It goes without saying, that the cases where compromise is struck postconviction, the High Court ought to exercise such discretion with rectitude, keeping in view the circumstances surrounding the incident, the fashion in which the compromise has been arrived at, and with due regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence, besides the conduct of the accused, before and after the incidence.   A restrictive construction of inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. may lead to rigid or specious justice,  13...The touchstone for exercising the extra­ordinary power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. would be to secure the ends of justice. There can be no hard and fast line constricting the power of the High Court to do substantial justice. A restrictive construction of inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. may lead to rigid or specious justice, which in the given facts and circumstances of a case, may rather lead to grave injustice. On the other hand, in cases where heinous offences have been proved against perpetrators, no such benefit ought to be extended Let no guilty man escape, if it can be avoided 14. In other words, grave or serious offences or offences which involve moral turpitude or have a harmful effect on the social and moral fabric of the society or involve matters concerning public policy, cannot be construed betwixt two individuals or groups only, for such offences have the potential to impact the society at large. Effacing abominable offences through quashing process would not only send a wrong signal to the community but may also accord an undue benefit to unscrupulous habitual or professional offenders, who can secure a 'settlement' through duress, threats, social boycotts, bribes or other dubious means. It is well said that "let no guilty man escape, if it can be avoided." Jurisdiction exercisable under Article 142 of the Constitution embraces this Court with scopious powers to quash criminal proceedings also Referring to Article 142 of the Constitution, the court observed : 18. It is now a well crystalized axiom that the plenary jurisdiction of this Court to impart complete justice under Article 142 cannot ipso facto be limited or restricted by ordinary statutory provisions. It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of an express provision akin to Section 482 Cr.P.C. conferring powers on the Supreme Court to abrogate and set aside criminal proceedings, the jurisdiction exercisable under Article 142 of the Constitution embraces this Court with scopious powers to quash criminal proceedings also, so as to secure complete justice. In doing so, due regard must be given to the overarching objective of sentencing in the criminal justice system, which is grounded on the sub­lime philosophy of maintenance of peace of the collective and that the rationale of placing an individual behind bars is aimed at his reformation. While allowing the appeal, court therefore concluded: 19. We thus sum­up and hold that as opposed to Section 320 Cr.P.C. where the Court is squarely guided by the compromise between the parties in respect of offences 'compoundable' within the statutory framework, the extra­ordinary power enjoined upon a High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. or vested in this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds of Section 320 Cr.P.C. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude ought to be exercised carefully in the context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind: (i) Nature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society; (ii) Seriousness of the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise between the accused and the victim; & (iv) Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of the purported offence and/or other relevant considerations.

The Supreme Court Collegium has expressed its disagreement with the Centre which returned the proposal to appoint gay Advocate Saurabh Kirpal as a Judge of the Delhi High Court, based on his openness about his sexual orientation. The Centre apprehends that given his "attachment" to the cause of gay-rights, it cannot rule out the possibility of Kirpal's bias and prejudice. It had therefore referred the proposal back for reconsideration. However, in a resolution dated January 18 reiterating Kirpal's name, the Collegium comprising CJI DY Chandrachud, Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph said, "The fact that Mr. Saurabh Kirpal has been open about his orientation is a matter which goes to his credit. As a prospective candidate for judgeship, he has not been surreptitious about his orientation. In view of the constitutionally recognized rights which the candidate espouses, it would be manifestly contrary to the constitutional principles laid down by the Supreme Court to reject his candidature on that ground." The proposal to appoint Kirpal has been pending for over five years. The recommendation was unanimously made by the Collegium of the Delhi High Court on 13 October 2017 and approved by the Supreme Court Collegium on 11 November 2021. The SC Collegium agreed that it was advisable for Kirpal to not speak to the Press in regard to the reasons which may have weighed in the recommendations of the Collegium being sent back for reconsideration. However, it added that Kirpal possesses competence, integrity and intellect. "His appointment will add value to the Bench of the Delhi High Court and provide inclusion and diversity. His conduct and behaviour have been above board." Another reason cited by the Centre to return the proposal is that Kirpal's partner is a Swiss National. SC Collegium however noted that there is no apprehension that behaviour of Kirpal's partner has any bearing on national security. "There is no reason to pre-suppose that the partner of the candidate, who is a Swiss National, would be inimically disposed to our country, since the country of his origin is a friendly nation. Many persons in high positions including present and past holders of constitutional offices have and have had spouses who are foreign Nationals. Hence, as a matter of principle, there can be no objection to the candidature of Shri Saurabh Kirpal on the ground that his partner is a foreign National." Reiterating the proposal, the Collegium stated : "The overwhelmingly positive aspects of the candidature of Shri Saurabh Kirpal must, therefore, weigh in the balance. In this backdrop, the Collegium resolves to reiterate its recommendation dated 11 November, 2021 for appointment of Shri Saurabh Kirpal as a Judge of the Delhi High Court which needs to be processed expeditiously"

The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Tuesday, directed the release of an adult woman confined at Nari Niketan, who was facing opposition in her family for wanting to marry a man outside her religion.  The division bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Manindar Singh Bhatti further advised her to concentrate on finishing her studies, stating that marriage, though important, can be postponed when pitched against education. The Bench was essentially dealing with a petition seeking issuance of writ of habeas corpus for release of the Corpus from her alleged unlawful confinement at Nari Niketan.  In the instant case, the Petitioner and the Corpus had known one another for years and had developed fondness for each other, and were inclined to get married. However, it was alleged that the parents of the Corpus were unable to approve of the marriage between her and the Petitioner, primarily because the Petitioner belonged to a different religion. Another concern on the part of the parents was that the Corpus was of an impressionable age i.e., 19 years, when she should be prioritizing her academic career over marriage.  During the proceedings, the Corpus categorically expressed her desire to marry the Petitioner. She also revealed that the petitioner has assured her of physical and financial assistance for completing her education (She is pursuing a Nursing Course). However, she shared her apprehension with the Court that the Petitioner may solemnize another marriage after marrying her. Corollary to the same, the Court directed the Petitioner to file an affidavit to assuage the concern of the Corpus.  Complying with the directions of the Court, the Petitioner filed an affidavit, stating that he wanted to marry the Corpus under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. He also stated that he would take care of her needs as per his capacity and ensure that she completes her education. He further stated that he has never asked her to change her religion and that since she is an adult, it is up to her to decide which religion she would want to follow, as is his choice to follow a religion of his own liking.  The Court noted the apprehensions raised by the father and brother of the Corpus about her safety and security. Her family claimed that their interest was in the Corpus completing her studies so that she attains self-reliance and is not dependent on the Petitioner who has meager source of income.  The Court accepted that the Corpus was above 19 years old and was legally entitled to take a decision with regard to the choice of her marriage. However, it noted that the concerns of her family members towards her cannot be belittled by her own desire to marry the person she wants to.  The corpus is more than 19 years of age (D.O.B. 19.10.2002) and therefore, as per law is entitled to take a decision on the choice of marriage. However, parents of corpus are equally concerned with the safety and security of their daughter and their cause of concern cannot be belittled when compared with the desire of corpus to get married to the petitioner. Having observed the same, the Court held that since the Corpus had attained the age of majority, she could not be confined in Nari Niketan, and therefore, ordered her release-  The corpus has already attained the age of majority and, therefore, cannot be kept confined in Nari Niketan where she was lodged since last few days awaiting resolution of the dispute that arose between the petitioner, corpus and parents of corpus. This Court therefore issues a writ of habeas corpus directing Nari Niketan at Pathar Khera District Betul (M.P.) to release the corpus forthwith and allow her to exercise right to personal liberty.   The Court then shared its view on the importance of a father in the life of his daughter-  Before parting, this Court would like to add that role of the father of the corpus does not come to an end if the corpus gets married (to anyone). The father continues to be father even after marriage of his daughter and, therefore, is equally entitled to ensure the safety and security of the daughter. Thus, this Court expects that the father of the corpus shall continue to keep in touch with the corpus and provide her with the financial and emotional assistance which she requires to the extent such assistance falls short and is unable to be provided by her spouse.   The Court further sermonised the Corpus, advising her to focus on completing her education and becoming independent. It further opined that marriage, though important, should take a backseat when pitched against education-   The corpus is also advised by this Court to understand the priorities in life. Academics has very important role to play in the early formative years of a human being. Thus, the corpus should first concentrate on completing her education to such extent which assures her with source of livelihood to take care of her necessities and comforts without being dependent upon anyone including her husband. Marriage is a concept which is though important in life but can very well be postponed and takes a backseat when pitched against the all important concept of education. The corpus is expected to pay heed to the aforesaid advice to gain sufficient maturity in life for understanding difference between right and wrong.   To ensure the well-being of the Corpus (an adult woman), the Court directed that the Counsellor under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, having territorial jurisdiction over the area where she decides to reside at, shall submit a fortnightly report on her, to the Court-   To ensure the safety and security of the corpus at the place of her choice of residence, the councillor under the J.J. Act having territorial jurisdiction over the area where the corpus shall henceforth resides, shall submit a fortnightly report about well being of the corpus especially as to whether the corpus is pursuing academic career uninterruptedly or not. This case is kept pending awaiting a fortnightly report of the councillor about the well being of the corpus from the place of her choice of residence.   With the aforesaid observations, the Court by way of writ of habeas corpus, directed Nari Niketan to release the Corpus to enable her to exercise her fundamental right to personal liberty, enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Court kept the case pending, awaiting a fortnightly report of the Counsellor about the well-being of the Corpus from the place of her choice of residence.

The Supreme Court observed that the reservation is an exception to the general rule of equality and thus cannot be regarded as basic feature of the Constitution. One of the main defence raised by the Centre was that the 103rd Constitutional amendment is enabling, and confer power upon the state, to make special provisions and reservations, based on the economic criterion – thus, cannot violate the basic structure. The majority judgment by Justice Dinesh Maheshwari held thus and added that 'being in the nature of enabling provision only, cannot be regarded as an essential feature of that nature whose modulation for the sake of other valid affirmative action would damage the basic structure of the Constitution'. The judge observed: The provisions contained in Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India, providing for reservation by way of affirmative action, being of exception to the general rule of equality, cannot be treated as a basic feature. Moreover, even if reservation is one of the features of the Constitution, it being in the nature of enabling provision only, cannot be regarded as an essential feature of that nature whose modulation for the sake of other valid affirmative action would damage the basic structure of the Constitution. Therefore, the doctrine of basic structure cannot be invoked for laying a challenge to the 103rd Amendment. [Para 101] Referring to some essays on the Basic Structure Doctrine, Justice JB Pardiwala observed: "I am of the view as Prof. Satya Prateek rightly puts that the enabling provisions, varying enforcement mechanisms and the State opinion on backwardness, reservation, adequate representation etc., in any circumstances cannot be recognised as the fundamental or basic structure of the Constitution. By their very nature, they are bound to change, with time, location and circumstances. On the other hand, the fundamental tenets or the core principles of the Constitution are foundational – they are at the core of its existence. They are seminal to the Constitution's functioning. The Constitution retains its existence on these foundations as they preserve the Constitution in its essence. This is not to mark out the possibilities of structural adjustments in the foundations with time. The foundations may shift, fundamental values may assume a different meaning with time but they would still remain to be integral to the constitutional core of principles, the core on which the Constitution would be legitimately sustained."  According to minority opinion authored by Justice S. Ravindra Bhat it is inaccurate to say that provisions that enable, exercise of power, would not violate the basic structure of the Constitution. "The enabling provision in question's basic premise, its potential to overbear the constitutional ethos, or overcome a particular value, would be in issue. The court's inquiry therefore, cannot stop at the threshold, when an enabling provision is enacted. Its potential for violating the basic structure of the Constitution is precisely the power it confers, on the legislature, or the executive. To borrow a powerful simile from a dissenting opinion in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, that upheld broad use of emergency power, to incarcerate thousands of US citizens, such enabling powers, if left alone, can "lie(s) about like a loaded weapon" with its potential to destroy core constitutional values". The judge added that the the fact that impugned amendments have introduced provisions which are merely enabling, does not protect it from basic structure scrutiny.  "To view a newly added provision as only "enabling" can be an oversimplification in constitutional parlance. The court's concern is not with the conferment of power per se, but with the width of it, lack of constitutional control, and the direct impact it can have on principles constituting the basic structure.", Justice Bhat observed.

The Delhi High Court has issued additional directions for removal of unauthorised encroachments by shopkeepers and residents inside city's Kalkaji Temple and also regarding portable drinking water facilities for devotees.

The Delhi High Court has issued additional directions for removal of unauthorised encroachments by shopkeepers and residents inside city's Kalkaji Temple and also regarding portable drinking water facilities for devotees.  Justice Pratibha M Singh was of the opinion that the shopkeepers who had made their residences and were in unauthorised occupation of shops including the Dharamshala need to be vacated.  "It is also made clear that for vacation of the shops and of unauthorized occupants from the Mandir premises, the ld. Administrator shall continue to take action as per the previous orders of this Court, with effect from 10th December, 2021 onwards," the Court said.  The Court also requested the Court appointed architect to inspect and survey the entire temple premises and suggest an alternate place where the shops may be temporarily run till the final plan for the re-development of the Mandir is approved.  "For the said purpose, if the shopkeepers file their undertakings before this court, an option could be given, on the basis of the highest bid which may be received as per the public notice floated by the Administrator on 12th November, 2021, to all the shopkeepers who have had their shops for a long period in the Kalkaji Mandir premises to run shops, subject to payment of tehbazari/licence fee in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed," the Court ordered.  It further added that in case the shopkeepers file their undertakings to the effect that they would not occupy or reside in the temple premises, the Court could consider their undertakings and pass directions on the next date of hearing. As regards to the shopkeepers whose unauthorised residences within the temple premises are to be vacated, the Court permitted them to approach the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and DDA for alternate premises in case they are eligible in accordance with law. "If DUSIB has a process of providing रैन बसेरा (Night shelter) they are permitted to avail of the same in accordance with law as well. Insofar as the SDMC and the DDA are concerned, it is made clear that all the encroachments and persons who are in the unauthorised occupation, whether in the shops or residences, have to be removed from the Kalkaji Mandir and requisite cooperation shall be extended by the officials concerned, to the ld. Administrator for the said purpose," it said.  The Court also directed the Delhi Jal Board to ensure that the blocked sewer lines which were not in a serviceable condition, are opened and put into proper functional use for the purpose of providing portable drinking water facilities to devotees.  The Court also dismissed a review plea challenging the order dated 27th September 2021 filed by one of the baridaars at the Kalkaji Temple.  On the argument that the appointment of the Administrator could only be made for a limited period, the Court ordered thus: "the gross mismanagement that was happening in the Mandir and the complete unauthorized encroachment and the whimsical manner in which the tehbazari were being given had created a matter of immense concern, especially, in light of the fact that hundreds and thousands of devotees visit the Mandir every day. Moreover, there is no unity among the various baridaars. Each group has various sub-groups and all individuals speak in different voices. There is enormous in-fighting amongst the stakeholders which is reflected in various proceedings that were pending in different courts. Some cases have been filed for each and every bari and the said baris are being auctioned, on a commercial basis." It added: "The spiritual sanctity of the Mandir is completely eroded by all the stakeholders, unauthorised occupants, encroachments by shopkeepers, lack of cleanliness and hygiene, lack of basic amenities to devotees. It was under these circumstances that before this Court, the baridaars, as noted in the order dated 27th September 2021, clearly arrived at a consensus that there was a need to appoint an Administrator to look after the administration of the Kalkaji Mandir." The matter will now be considered on December 21.  Earlier, the Court had slew of directions regarding the administration and maintenance of the temple as also for resolution of disputes pertaining to the bari rights between baridaars to ensure smooth functioning of the temple. The Court had previously expressed concerns over the "dismal" maintenance of the temple and had also asked the local commissioner, appointed on the last date, to ascertain the collections/donations made to the Temple and check whether CCTV cameras installed inside its premises are operational. It was also reiterated that the reports submitted by previous Receivers and local commissioner showed that the cleanliness and maintenance of the temple complex was not satisfactory. The Court had appointed a local commissioner for paying surprise visits in the Temple in respect of ascertaining conduct of 'puja sewa', collection of offerings being put in donation boxes and also other issues regarding cleanliness, hygiene and facilities for devotees. Title: NEETA BHARDWAJ & ORS. v. KAMLESH SHARMA    
The Supreme Court observed that a Ballistic Report forwarded by Director/ Deputy Director/ Assistant Director of a lab under the seal can be said to be in compliance with the statutory requirement under Section 293 Cr.P.C. Section 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: Any document purporting to be a report under the hand of a Government scientific expert to whom this section applies, upon any matter or thing duly submitted to him for examination or analysis and report in the course of any proceeding under this Code, may be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code. In this case, reversing the acquittal by the Trial Court, the Allahabad High convicted all the accused for the offences under Sections 148, 302 read with 149, 307 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The Trial Court, while acquitting accused in a murder case, had refused to admit ballastic report on the ground that it is not a report selfsigned by an Assistant Director but that of some Scientific Officer, which has been merely forwarded by the Assistant Director. The High Court, while allowing appeal, held that the report could not have been discarded. On this aspect, while affirming the views of the High Court, the Apex Court bench observed that the requirement under Section 293 is in fact complied with as the report should be treated as under the hand of the Government Scientific Expert, being the "Director [, Deputy Director or Assistant Director] of a Central Forensic Science Laboratory or a State Forensic Science Laboratory" as provided under Section 293(4)(e). Referring to observations made in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Mast Ram (2004) 8 SCC 660, the bench of Justices said: "In view of the fact that the ballistic report has come from the office of the Assistant Director bearing his seal and having considered the same in the context of Section 293(4) Cr.P.C., as explained by this Court in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Mast Ram, we are opinion that the Trial Court committed a serious error in rejecting the ballistic report and it was necessary and compelling for the High Court to reverse the finding of the Trial Court on this count also". In its judgment upholding the High Court judgment, the bench has also discussed in detail various factual and legal aspects involved in this case [Please see headnotes].

Observing that repeated sexual activity on a 9 year old child is not possible without any injury in the vaginal /genital area, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently set aside the conviction order of the trial court passed against a rape accused.Finding that the prosecutrix may have been tutored to make the statement for implicating the appellant falsely, the Bench of Justice M.... Observing that repeated sexual activity on a 9 year old child is not possible without any injury in the vaginal /genital area, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently set aside the conviction order of the trial court passed against a rape accused. Finding that the prosecutrix may have been tutored to make the statement for implicating the appellant falsely, the Bench of Justice M. A. Chowdhary set aside the conviction order passed against one Ishfaq Ahmad Khan by Additional Sessions Judge, Anantnag under Section 376(2)(i) RPC convicting the appellant/rape accused. The case in brief  Appellant had moved the High Court challenging his conviction under Section 376(2)(i) RPC on the ground that he had been falsely implicated in the case by the father of the prosecutrix for dispute over some payments between them. It was further his case that the trial court had relied upon the statement of prosecutrix, though her statement did not inspire confidence to base conviction; that the prosecution had examined most of the witnesses from the family of the prosecutrix only, and their statements are of no corroboration with that of the statement of prosecutrix. On the Other hand, it was the prosecutrix version that during the night hours, appellant/accused molested her younger sister, who told her about this incident and she shifted her younger sister towards other side and slept herself on the side of the appellant. Thereafter, she alleged that the accused/appellant focused torch on her, took her to his bedding, gagged her mouth with a muffler and took off his and her lowers with the help of his legs and arms and then raped her. Court's observations  On consideration of whole of the gamut of the prosecution evidence, the Court observed that the case mainly revolved around the deposition of the prosecutrix who was only 9 years of age.  Further, the Court noted that though accused could be held guilty for the commission of offence of rape based on the solitary evidence of the prosecutrix, however the same must inspire confidence and should appear to be absolutely trustworthy, unblemished and should be of sterling quality. Now against this backdrop, when the Court analysed the deposition of the prosecutrix, it found that there was total variation in her version from what was stated in the complaint and what was deposed before the court at the time of trial.  "It is not understandable as to how the prosecutrix, who was apprehensive with regard to her sister who was younger to her being molested who in her own statement had not said anything with regard to her alleged molestation, and instead of informing her younger sister about the incident the prosecutrix should have informed her maternal uncle or her brother who too were sleeping in the same room, and how without any protest she was shifted to the bedding of the appellant by the appellant and then after having sexual activity went back to her own bedding...It cannot be possible that the child of the age of only 9 years, who even had not reached the age of menarche could be ravished three times repeatedly without any pain, protest or resistance which may not have been noticed by the other persons sleeping in the same room", the Court noted as it found the desposition of the prosecutirx unbelievable. The Court also osberved that the contention of the prosecutrix was belied to the extent that the statement of the medical expert who had clearly stated that there was no injury on the private parts of the prosecutrix.  "The repeated sexual activity on such a person of tender age cannot be possible without any injury in the vaginal /genital area...it is clear that presence of almost all the witnesses- parents, maternal uncle and siblings- elder brother and younger sister, was in the house and except parents all others in the room, where the prosecutrix is alleged to have been raped by the appellant, conduct of the parents to sleep in the upper floor, leaving the children including prosecutrix in the ground floor, where the beddings of the daughters were claimed to have been laid just besides that of appellant who was a stranger, is not understandable," the Court remarked as it found the prosecutrix's statement to be not sterling, and thus, it allowed the appeal of the accused.

On Wednesday, the Kerala High Court made a series of crucial statements on the status and duties of lawyers vis-a-vis their clients and the administration of justice in general. Culling the principles from case law, Justice R Narayana Pisharadi said, "When a lawyer is entrusted with a brief, he is expected to follow the norms of professional ethics and try to protect the interests of his clients, in relation to whom he occupies a position of trust" Iterating a lawyer's nodal role in the administration of justice, the Court said, "In the administration of law and justice, lawyers have to play an important part. They are, in a sense, officers of the court and as such they are given special rights and privileges..." The Court's remarks came in the course of an order dismissing a lawyer's petition seeking a quash of criminal breach of trust proceedings against him.  The lawyer was a legal officer in M/s Cherupushpam Kuries (a kind of chit fund) and was tasked with instituting recovery proceedings on amounts owed by its members. The company alleged that he misappropriated funds demarcated for instituting suits and provided false suit numbers to the company as if he had instituted the suits. Challenging the criminal breach of trust proceedings against him by the company, the counsel for the petitioner averred that he had been defrauded by his clerk. The petitioner insisted that he had attempted to institute proceedings after the clerk's fraud was discovered. Justice Pisharadi, however, held that the veracity of the petitioner's submissions could be decided only at trial and not in a quash proceeding. For the proceedings at hand, there seemed a prima facie case disclosed, the Court concluded, Since the petitioner in the case was a lawyer, the Court used the occasion to make the following observations about lawyers and their duties towards the law and clients: Lawyers as officers of the court have special rights and privileges, which had to be zealously safeguarded. Manak Lal v. Dr. Prem ChandLaw is a noble profession, monopoly conferred on the the legal profession by Parliament is coupled with a responsibility towards the clients. V.C. Rangadurai v. D.GopalanNothing was to be done by any member of the fraternity to lessen the confidence the public reposed in its fidelity, honesty, and integrity. V.C. Rangadurai v.

Disapproving the blanket orders passed by a single judge of the Rajasthan High Court to not list applications for bail and suspension of sentence as urgent matters during the lockdown, the Supreme Court has observed that the right to apply for bail is an individual right implicit in Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The Court has observed that such blanket bans would suspend Fundamental Rights of individuals and block access for seekers of liberty to apply for bail. A Bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose made the observations while delivering the judgement in special leave petitions filed against orders of the Rajasthan High Court which directed the Registry to not to list bails, appeals, applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and revisions in the category of extreme urgent matters. Also under challenge was a direction issued by the single bench this year to the Registry to not list applications seeking anticipatory bail in offences where maximum sentence extends upto three years during the summer vacation of the Court. These orders were challenged before the Supreme Court by the Rajasthan High Court itself. "Such an order also has the effect of temporarily eclipsing statutory provisions" the Supreme Court said. While noting that the blanket order was passed by the High Court without compliance of procedure established by law, the Bench has observed that blanket order prohibiting listing of bail application or applications for suspension of sentence in appeals also infringes upon the right of personal liberty of incarcerated persons. "Such right has been taken away by judicial order, without compliance of procedure established by law, which in our constitutional jurisprudence, is akin to "the due process" dictum." the Bench said. "Right to apply for bail is an individual right implicit in Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution", the judgment authored by Justice Bose stated.  The Court also observed that the right of an accused, an undertrial prisoner or a convicted person awaiting appeal court's verdict to seek bail on suspension of sentence is recognised in Sections 439, 438 and 389 of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code. The Bench also found it improper for the Single Judge to come to a general finding that when there is complete lockdown the bail applications, appeal under SC/ST Act and applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and revisions could not be considered to be matters of extreme urgency. "Such sweeping orders in our adversarial adjudicatory system would be contrary to law as many persons would be impacted by such orders without having any knowledge of the proceeding." the Bench said.  While delivering its verdict, the Bench expressed disapproval of both the directions of restrictions on arrest and listing of bail applications issued by a single bench of the High Court. "The directions issued had the potential for breaching the constitutional and legal rights of individuals who could be or are arraigned in criminal action and also put fetters on power of investigating agencies." the Bench recorded.  The impugned orders were issued in applications for anticipatory bails when the Covid-19 pandemic was raging across this country. However the bail pleas were ultimately rejected by the High Court later. Observing that the impact of the orders under appeal no more survives, the Bench refrained from formally setting aside the orders while allowing the Rajasthan High Court's appeal.  There were two Special Leave Petitions before the Supreme Court - SLP(Crl) No.5618/2020 and SLP(Crl) No.3949/2021. The first one challenged the order passed by a single bench of High Court on March 30 last year directing the Registry to not list applications for bail and sentence suspension as urgent matters during the period of lockdown. The second SLP challenged the order passed by the single bench on May 17 this year, in which the restraint order against police regarding arrests in cases with less than 3 years imprisonment as punishment and the direction to not list anticipatory bail applications in cases with less than 3 years imprisonment as punishment were passed. Incidentally, both the impugned orders were passed by a bench of Justice Pankaj Bhandari. The Supreme Court had earlier stayed the operation of both the orders. The order passed on March 30, 2020 was stayed by the Supreme Court on April 3, 2020. The order passed on May 17, 2021, was stayed by a vacation bench of the Supreme Court on May 25, 2021.  Case Title : High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan versus The State of Rajasthan and Another, SLP(Crl) No.5618/2020 and SLP(Crl) No.3949/2021.   
Unfortunately, POSCO Act does not distinguish between rape and consensual sexual interactions, the Court added.The Kerala High Court on Wednesday expressed its concerns over adolescents being unaware of the consequences of having sexual relationships with each other, even if they are consensual, under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the amended Section 376 of IPC.  Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas was adjudicating upon a bail application when he commented on the alarming rise in the number of sexual offences being committed against school children, most of them being cases where teenagers indulged in sexual relationships, oblivious to the severe consequences under the POCSO Act.  "Young children, irrespective of gender, indulge in such acts, unmindful of the drastic consequences that await them. The amendments brought into the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the enactment of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, envisage very harsh consequences for such offensive acts. Unfortunately, the statute does not distinguish between the conservative concept of the term rape and the sexual interactions arising out of pure affection and biological changes." At this point, the Single Judge also added that unfortunately, the POCSO Act sticks to a conservative idea of rape, without any regard to normal teenage feelings and urges. "The statutes do not contemplate the biological inquisitiveness of adolescence and treat all 'intrusions' on bodily autonomy, whether by consent or otherwise, as rape for certain age group of victims."  It added that teenagers and adolescents indulge in sexual relationships unmindful of the consequences and that by the time they realise them, it would be too late. "A meaningful life could practically be snuffed out by an immature or negligent act arising out of human curiosity or biological cravings, which psychologists regard as natural."  Although ignorance of law is not an excuse, (ignorantia juris non excusat), the Court found it imperative that school children be made aware of the POCSO Act. Therefore, the State and the Department of Education were asked to take necessary steps to raise awareness of the same by including it in the curriculum if possible.  "The curriculum must of necessity prescribe sessions/classes on the provisions of the POCSO Act as well as the amendments brought into section 376 of IPC. The educational machinery of the State has fallen woefully short in imparting the required awareness to the young children about the heinous crimes and its consequences."  To study the prospects of raisisng awareness, the Court suo moto impleaded the State Department of Education, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Kerala State Legal Services Authority into the plea to issue directions for paving the way for better awareness on the statutes concerned in schools in the State.  "Time has come for this Court to step in to explore the possibilities of methods in which the awareness can be created," the order said.  The matter will be heard again on June 27.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered the setting up of a special investigating team (SIT) to investigate the death of a 25-year-old woman Rasika Jain, who had fallen from the third-floor terrace of her in-law's house in February 2021, following which her family members complained of foul play. They moved the High Court claiming that the police were not properly pursuing the case and prayed for the court's intervention. Justice Shampa Sarkar opined that the investigation into the case by the State police authorities has been 'slow and directionless' and further underscored,  "Having considered the graveness of the allegations, the social position of the parties and the unfortunate events which led to the death of the young lady and especially in view of the delay which has occurred in the interregnum period, this Court is of the view that the investigation ought to have been conducted in a more speedy and systematic manner. It has been rather slow and directionless. The offences relate to dowry death and crime against women. It has a huge social impact." The Court further averred that in view of the gravity of the offences, a Special Investigating Team consisting of senior and experienced police officers should be constituted. Directing the special commissioner of police, Kolkata, Damayanti Sen to set up the SIT within seven days and start the investigation, the Court ordered,  "The Court directs Smt. Damayanti Sen, Special Commissioner of Police (II), Kolkata Police, to constitute her own team of competent officers to take over the investigation. At least a team of five officers must be constituted." The instant plea had been moved by the father of the deceased victim who had got married to one Kushal Agarwal on February 9, 2020. It was alleged that there were instances when the deceased had met her parents and had intimated them about the alleged physical and mental torture inflicted by her husband and the alleged debauchery the husband had indulged in. Thereafter, on February 16, 2021, the petitioner had received a call from the mother-in-law of the deceased, informing him that his daughter had fallen from the terrace of her matrimonial home and was taken to Woodlands Hospital. The victim succumbed her injuries on the same day. A whatsapp message was received by the petitioner.  During the proceedings, it had been contended that the investigating agency has failed and neglected to proceed with the investigation with the judiciousness, seriousness, expedition and sensitivity which this case deserved. It was further alleged that no report has yet been obtained from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory at Bhopal and that the Sub-Inspector who is the investigating officer, is under tremendous pressure. Directing the SIT to expeditiously probe the case with independence and effectiveness, the Court observed,  "It is expected that the team shall be constituted within a week from the date of communication of this order and immediate steps shall be taken to proceed with the investigation, with the independence and the effectiveness that is required. One and a half years have already passed, without much development." Accordingly, the Court directed the SIT to submit its status report indicating the development and the progress of the case on the next date of hearing which is slated to take place on August 12.

Hate speech strikes at the preambular goals of liberty, equality, and fraternity that are the foundational values embedded in our Constitution, said Justice B.V. Nagarathna, while delivering a dissenting judgement proposing to hold the government vicariously liable for a statement made by a minister that is traceable to any affairs of the state or for the protection of the government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility. While the other four judges on the Constitution Bench, namely, Justices S. Abdul Nazeer, B.R. Gavai, A.S. Bopanna, and V. Ramasubramanian rejected the contention that vicarious liability could be envisaged in such a situation, Justice Nagarathna dissented on this point (while concurring with majority on other issues).  In her separate opinion, she analysed the critical and doctrinal underpinnings justifying a restraint on derogatory and discouraging speech with respect to two primary factors – human dignity as a value as well as a right, and the preambular goals of equality and fraternity. “Hate speech strikes at the foundational values of the Constitution by marking out a society as being unequal. It also violates the fraternity of citizens from diverse backgrounds, which is the sine qua non of a cohesive society based on plurality and multiculturalism such as in India that is Bharat,” the judge said. Speaking about fraternity, Justice Nagarathna asserted that it was based on the idea that citizens had reciprocal responsibilities towards one another and took within its sweep, inter alia, the ideals of tolerance, cooperation and mutual aid.  The Supreme Court judge reiterated that it was a fundamental duty of every citizen of India to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of the country and promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood between all the people of India, transcending religious, linguistic, regional, and sectional diversities. Every citizen was under a constitutional obligation, she added, to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women and to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, “so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement”. She explained that the fundamental duties of citizens also constituted the core constitutional values for good citizenship in our democracy. “All citizens were enjoined with the obligation of promoting fraternity, harmony, unity, and collective welfare,” Justice Nagarathna said.  Justice Nagarathna further observed that public functionaries and other persons of influence and celebrities, having regard to their reach and their impact on the public or a certain section, were duty bound to be more responsible and restrained in their speech. “They are required to understand and measure their words having regard to the likely consequences on public sentiment and behaviour and also be aware of the example they are setting on the fellow citizens to follow.” She also cautioned that it was for the political parties to regulate and control the action and speech of their functionaries and members. “This could be through a code of conduct which would prescribe the limits of permissible speech by functionaries and members of the respective political parties,” the judge suggested.  Finally, she reminded that any citizen who is subjected to hate speech by a public functionary or otherwise would be entitled to approach a court of law and seek appropriate remedies. “Whenever permissible, civil remedies in the nature of declaratory remedies, injunctions as well as pecuniary damages may be awarded as prescribed under relevant statues,” she said.

The Supreme Court on Monday appointed a committee to conduct local inspection with regard to the quality and quantity of water released by the state of Haryana at Balla (upstream of the Yamuna river in Delhi), the level of the Wazirabad bank and whether the Delhi government is diverting the water to the Water Treatment Plants at Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla before the water reaches the Wazirabad bank. The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian was hearing a writ petition by the Delhi Jal Board  seeking appropriate directions to the state of Haryana over discharge of untreated pollutants, in view of the increased concentration of ammonia in the river water of Yamuna. It has been prayed that the Court ensure that enough water is supplied to the NCT of Delhi, at a level of 674.503 feet, in pursuance of the Supreme Court decision in the 1996 case of Delhi Water Supply, to ensure that the high concentration of ammonia in the water is diluted. In view of the urgency of the matter, the bench required the committee to conduct the inspection  within three days time and to submit a report to the court within three days. The matter will now be heard by the court on Friday. The bench noted that the DJB is complaining of the water level being 664 feet instead of 674 feet. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, for the DJB, submitted that the reduction in the supply of water by the state of Haryana has led to the increase of ammonia in the water leading to health problems. Senior counsel Pururshaindra Kaurav, for the state of Haryana, submitted that the Upper Yamuna River Board has carried out an inspection and submitted a report in 2017, which shows that the water being supplied was up to the level of 670.7 above the river bank. He argued that there has to be a diversion of water to the water treatment plants before it reaches the riverbank. "Before entering into the merits of the matter, we did deem it fit and proper that a committee should be appointed to conduct local inspection within a period of three days as regards the following: (1) the quality and quantity of water being released by Haryana at Palla, (2) the level of the Wazirabad bank and (3) whether the Delhi government is diverting the water to the water treatment plants at Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal before the water reaches the Wazirabad bank ", said the bench. The committee constituted by the court is to comprise the Secretary, Delhi Jal Shakti Ministry, who shall be the chairman of the committee, and representatives of the Delhi Pollution Control Board, the Delhi Jal Board, the Haryana Pollution Control Board and the Haryana Irrigation Department.      
The Allahabad High Court today granted bail to Kanpur-based Perfume businessman, Peeyush Jain in connection with a case registered against him for allegedly stashing cash amounting to Rs. 196.57 Crores. He has been directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.10 Lakhs and two reliable sureties each of the like amount.The bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi granted him bail as it noted that even... The Allahabad High Court today granted bail to Kanpur-based Perfume businessman, Peeyush Jain in connection with a case registered against him for allegedly stashing cash amounting to Rs. 196.57 Crores. He has been directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs.10 Lakhs and two reliable sureties each of the like amount. The bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi granted him bail as it noted that even if the allegation is one of grave economic offence, it is not a rule that bail should be denied in every case since there is no such bar created in the relevant enactment passed by the legislature nor does the bail jurisprudence provide so. "The position of law regarding grant of bail which emerges from the judgments of the Supreme Court referred to above, is that the basic jurisprudence relating to bail in economic offences remains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is the rule and refusal is the exception so as to ensure that the accused has the opportunity of securing fair trial. It is not advisable to categorize all economic offences into one group and deny bail on that basis. One of the circumstances to consider the gravity of the offence is the term of sentence that is prescribed for the offence the accused is alleged to have committed," the Court remarked. The case in brief Essentially, on December 22, 2021, the Officers of the DGGI started making a search on the residential and official premises of Jain at Kannuaj and Kanpur, which continued till December 28, 2021. Cash amounting to Rs. 196.57 Crores was seized from his premises besides the recovery of 23 kilograms of gold. Jain was arrested on December 26, 2021 and was booked under Section 132 (1) (a) read with Section 132 (1) (i) and 132 (5) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 It has been alleged that Jain is one of the partners in the firm M/S Odochem Industries and he used to operate and manage two other proprietorship concerns along with his brother Ambrish Kumar Jain, and that they were collectively engaged in illicit supply of finished goods, namely perfumery compounds, without issuing any tax invoice and without payment of GST. Separate proceedings have been initiated against the applicant in respect to the recovery of 23 KG of Gold under the provision of the Customs Act, 1962. Arguments advanced Jain's counsel, Senior Advocate Anurag Khanna argued that the offences alleged to carry a minimum punishment of six months imprisonment and a maximum of five years imprisonment and the offence is compoundable, which indicates that the offence is not grave.  He further submitted that the applicant has already paid a sum of Rs.54.09 Crores towards tax, interest, and penalty and he has undertaken to deposit the amount of any additional liability whereas the Department is yet to ascertain his tax liability.  It was further contended that Jain has already spent more than 8 months in jail and during this period the department has not sought his custodial interrogation, which shows that his custody is not at all required.  On the other hand, the counsel for the DGGI contended that the applicant is also accused of committing offence under the Customs Act (23 Kg of Gold Recovery) and the present case falls under clause (c) of the Proviso appended to Section 138 and therefore, the same is not compoundable.   Court's observations At the outset, the Court noted that so as to attract clause (c) of the Proviso appended to Section 138, the person should have been accused of committing an offence under this Act which is also an offence under any other law for the time being in force.  However, the Court noted that the allegations against the applicant which amount to an offence under the Customs Act, are not an offence under this act and vice versa and, therefore, the Court held that clause (c) of the Proviso appended to Section 138 won't be attracted in the present case. The Court further stressed that prayer for bail is not to be denied merely because the sentiments of the community are against the accused. Consequently, the Court granted him bail by taking into account the following factors: - The offences alleged carry a minimum punishment of six months imprisonment and a maximum of five years imprisonment and the offences are compoundable, which indicates that the offences are not grave;  - The applicant has already paid a sum of Rs. 54.09 Crores towards tax, interest and penalty and he has undertaken to deposit the amount of any additional liability;  - The Department is yet to ascertain the applicant's tax liability;  - The amount of Rs.196,57,02,539/- seized by the DGGI from the applicant's premises is still lying with the Department and, therefore, the interest of the Revenue, as well as that of the public at large, is protected;  - The applicant has already spent more than 8 months in jail and during this period the department has not sought his custodial Page 14 of 16 interrogation, which shows that his custody is not at all required;  Case title - Peeyush Kumar Jain v.

A Division Bench of the Supreme Court, on Friday, took a divergent view on the scope of review, when the judgment relied on in the impugned order and all subsequent judgment that followed it is eventually overruled by a superior court. While Justice MR Shah allowed the review petitions, Justice BV Nagarathna opined that they are not maintainable and are in the teeth of the Explanation to Order XLVII Rule 1 Code of Civil Procedure (Application for review of judgment) which categorically states that a fact that the decision on a question of law on which the judgment of the Court is based has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of a superior Court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review of such judgment.  Background Section 24 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement, 2013, which is essentially a saving clause came to be interpreted in Pune Municipal Corporation v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki. In Indore Development Authority v Shailendra the interpretation was referred to a Three-Judge Bench, which considered the issue and decided that Pune Municipal Corporation did not cover certain aspects of the interpretation of Section 24(2) and the matter was referred to a Larger Bench. In other similar matters reference was also made to a larger bench. In Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal, a Constitution Bench overruled Pune Municipal Corporation and all other decisions where Pune Municipal Corporation was followed.   After the decision in Indore Development Authority, the present batch of petitions have been filed by land acquiring authorities/States seeking review of the Special Leave Petitions and Civil Appeals that were disposed of in terms of the judgment in Pune Municipal Corporation. The review petitioners have argued that Indore Development Authority explicitly overruled Pune Municipal Corporation and also all other subsequent judgments that had followed Pune Municipal Corporation. They seek recalling of the judgment and to restore the Civil Appeals and SLPs. The respondents objected to the maintainability of the review petitions. The argument put forth by the respondents is that when in Indore Development Authority, the Constitution Bench held that Pune Municipal Corporation and all the judgments where it was followed is overruled, they were denuded of their precedential authority, but the decisions in these cases are still binding on the parties involved. Relying on Explanation to Order XLVII Rule 1 Code of Civil Procedure, it was argued that when a decision on a question of law on which the judgment of the Court has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of the superior Court, it shall not be a ground for review of such judgment. In particular, they referred to the judgment in Beghar Foundation v. Justice KS Puttaswamy And Ors., wherein while considering the review petition filed against the judgment in Justice KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India (Aadhaar judgment) it was observed that change in law or subsequent decisions of a Larger Bench by itself is not a ground of seeking relief by filing a review petition. The respondents also raised objections with respect to the delay in filing the review petitions.  Analysis by the Supreme Court Justice Nagarathna noted that Rule 1 of Order XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 states that in any civil case review lies on the grounds stated under Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC. There are broadly three grounds under the said provision and they are as follows:  i) due to discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person aggrieved or the person seeking review could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or  ii) due to a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or iii) on account of any other sufficient reason,  may seek review of a judgment or order of this Court. The Explanation to Order XLVII Rule 1 reads as under -  a fact that the decision on a question of law on which the judgment of the Court is based has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of a superior Court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review of such judgment. In the present case, the review petitioner have sought review on the (iii) ground i.e., “on account of any other sufficient reason”. However, the expression is not defined in CPC. Referring to three judgments, the judge observed that “other sufficient reason” must be analogous to the two other reasons mentioned in the provision.  It was noted that although the expression “for any other sufficient reason” is wide enough to take into its scope any situation which is not covered by (i) and (ii), but if a decision of a court is reopened on the basis of a subsequent decision there would be no finality of judgment between the parties. Even if a judgment is subsequently held to be erroneous and is reversed, it would be binding on the parties thereof.  “Merely because that judgment is subsequently overruled by a subsequent decision of a superior Court in any other case, the same shall not be a ground for review of such judgment.” With respect to the Explanation, the judge noted that the same was in the nature of a proviso and its object and purpose is to be given its full effect. She opined that the explanation indicates that there must be an end to litigation. Considering the scope and ambit of the explanation and the catena of judgments on the scope of review, J. Nagarathna thought it fit to dismiss the review petitions on the grounds of maintainability. She also observed that in Indore Development Authority the Constitution Bench overruled Pune Municipal Corporation and subsequent decisions but did not state that they are open to be reviewed as the same would have been in the teeth of Explanation to Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC.  Justice Shah took a different view. He opined that the judgment under review was passed solely relying on the earlier decision in Pune Municipal Corporation, which was itself doubted and referred to a Constitution Bench, which eventually overruled the decision. Therefore, the review/recall applications were allowed by the Judge. He considered the factual aspects while deciding to allow the review applications filed by the acquiring authorities. Justice Shah also said that it will be in "larger public interest" to allow the review applications, considering that the land acquisitions will lapse otherwise.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has recently held that the seeker of condonation of delay is not required to explain the period of his absence during the trial, what is required is explanation for period of delay which runs as per the Limitation Act. The observations were made by Justice Vinod Chatterji Koul while hearing a civil second appeal in terms of which the appellant had thrown a challenge to the judgment passed by District Judge, Kulgam in terms of which it had dismissed the application seeking condonation of a delay of 24 days. As a consequence, the appeal also got dismissed as the court below held it to be time barred. The court after perusing the material on record, noted that First Appellate Court (District Judge, Kulgam) has taken into account the absence of appellant before the Trial court as according to First Appellate Court the appellant has not given sufficient reasons that prevented him to appear before Trial Court during pendency of the civil suit till it culminated in passing of ex parte decree. In its bid to answer the question as to “whether the seeker of condonation of delay was required to explain the period of his absence during the trial of the suit”, Justice Koul observed that First Appellate Court should have been alive to the position that an application seeking condonation of delay is to be decided while taking liberal view subject to explanation given by appellant more particularly when even there is not any inordinate delay. Elaborating further on the subject Justice Koul elucidated that the appellant was to explain the delay which occasioned in not filing the appeal within the limitation period after passing of the decree and judgment, further adding,   "However, the First Appellate court has passed order impugned rejecting the application by holding that no sufficient cause has been shown by the appellant for his absence before the Trial court for the period ex parte proceedings were initiated against him till passing of the judgment,"  Pointing out the perversity in the judgment of the First Appellate Court the bench further added that law provides that delay is to be explained for the period beyond the period of limitation prescribed and the limitation in this case would run from the date of passing of the decree and not from any date prior to passing of the same.  The court also noted that the applicant-petitioner was therefore, was therefore required to explain what occasioned the delay after passing of the decree, which has been Sufficiently explained in the application supported by an affidavit. The bench said that the First Appellate Court instead of limiting consideration to that period has gone beyond the provisions and has taken into account the period of absence before the Trial court. "The seeker of condonation of delay is not required to explain the period of his absence during the trial, what is required is the period of delay which runs as per the Limitation Act.", Justice Koul concluded while allowing the petition.

"Unless and until, the material is there to make out a case that the person has become a threat and menace to the Society so as to disturb the whole tempo of the society and that all social apparatus is in peril disturbing public order at the instance of such person, it cannot be said that the detenue is a person within the meaning of section 2(b) of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti... "Unless and until, the material is there to make out a case that the person has become a threat and menace to the Society so as to disturb the whole tempo of the society and that all social apparatus is in peril disturbing public order at the instance of such person, it cannot be said that the detenue is a person within the meaning of section 2(b) of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985", the Gujarat High Court has opined recently.  The Bench comprising Justice Rajendra Sareen was hearing a special civil application against the order of detention dated December 2021 against the Petitioner herein under Section 3(2) of the Act.  The Petitioner submitted that the registration of the solitary offence under Sections 65-AE, 116B, 98(2) and 81 of the Prohibition Act by itself cannot bring the case of the Petitioner within the purview of Section 2(b) of the Act. Additionally, it was averred that illegal activity likely to be carried out cannot have nexus with the maintenance of public order and at the most, it can be said to be breach of law and order. There was also no evidence barring the statement of witnesses and the registration of the FIRs to connect the alleged anti-social activity of the Petitioner with the breach of public order.  Per contra, the Respondent State supported the detention order and submitted that there was sufficient material discovered during the course of investigation which showed that the Petitioner was in the habit of indulging in activities defined under Section 2(b) of the Act. The Court stated that subjective satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority cannot be said to be legal, valid and in accordance with law, inasmuch as the offences alleged in the FIR/s cannot have any baring on the public order as required under the Act and other relevant penal laws are sufficient enough to take care of the situation. It observed that except general statements, there is no material on record which shows that the detenue is acting in such a manner, which is dangerous to the public order. Reliance was placed on Pushker Mukherjee v/s. State of West Bengal [AIR 1970 SC 852] wherein the Supreme Court had drawn a distinction between 'law and order' and 'public order':  "When two people quarrel and fight and assault each other inside a house or in a street, it may be said that there is disorder but not public disorder…The contravention of any law always affects order but before it can be said to affect public order, it must affect the community or the public at large. A mere disturbance of law and order leading to disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for action under the Preventive Detention Act but a disturbance which will affect public order comes within the scope of the Act."  In the instant case, per the Bench, the Petitioner had not committed an act within Section 2(b) of the Act such that it disturbed the tempo of the society. Owing to these facts and circumstances, Justice Sareen quashed and set aside the detention order.   Case Title:  DILIP BHAVANISHANKAR YADAV Versus STATE OF GUJARAT  Case No.: C/SCA/19820/2021

The Gujarat High Court has made it clear that civil courts have no jurisdiction to entertain and decide the question about citizenship of a person and that the said question falls within the exclusive domain of the Central government. Justice Nisha Thakore held thus in context of Section 9(2) of the Citizenship Act 1955 which provides that question whether any citizen of India has acquired the citizenship of another country shall be deter­mined by the prescribed authority. "The second question which is required to be looked into is whether he acquired the citizenship of another country or not, or can be said to have renounced Indian citizenship on issuance of passport of another country. There is no iota of doubt that as per Sub-section (2) of Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, read with section 40 along with schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 2009, the said question can exclusively be tried by the Central Government." The policy behind Section 9(2) appears to be that the right of citizenship of the person who is admittedly an Indian citizen should not be exposed to attack in all forums in the country, the Court said. It added that the question regarding citizenship should be decided by one authority in accordance with the prescribed rules and that every other Court or authority would have to act only on the basis of the decision of the prescribed authority in that behalf and on no other basis.  The observation comes in an appeal preferred by a 60 years old man, claiming to be born and brought up in India and seeking a declaration under Section 5(1)(c) of the Act that he is a citizen, on the basis of his marriage to an Indian citizen. The appellant had spent around 7 years of his life in Pakistan and the Centre had tendered documentary evidence in Court to establish that the appellant has been conferred Pakistani citizenship and he has been permitted to travel to India on temporary residential permit. The challenge in these proceedings were to an order of the District Judge, who had quashed the order of Civil Judge directing the Centre to not deport the Appellant until decision was taken under Section 9(2) of the Act.  At the outset, the High Court noted that on one hand the Appellant claimed to be Indian citizen by birth but in the same breath, he sought a declaration as to his citizenship on the basis of his marriage to an Indian.  It then observed that the District Court, in government appeal, had rightly proceeded to record the finding that the appellant is not an Indian citizen but holding nationality of Pakistan, on the basis of material produced before it. "In the opinion of this Court, the appellate court has not committed error or has misdirected itself by relying upon such documents which are otherwise proved as per provisions of the Evidence Act. In such circumstances, the burden has rightly been shifted upon the appellant to prove that he is not the citizen of Pakistan and having failed to lead any evidence contrary, the appellate court has rightly held so." The Court however did find force in the argument canvassed by the Appellant that the District Court misdirected in finding that the trial court committed gross error in assuming the jurisdiction to decide the question of section 9(2) of the Citizenship Act, and extending protection from deporting.  It noted that under Section 4 of the Specific Relief Act, the party can always approach civil court for protection of it's civil right. However, in the given facts of the case where the appellant was found to not be an Indian Citizen, jurisdiction of civil court to even look into the infringement of his civil right is excluded.  "Any order rendering with issue falling under the domain of the Citizenship Act shall in no uncertain terms can be said to be usurpation of jurisdiction of authority under the Citizenship Act." Reliance was placed on State of U.P. vs. Mohammad Din, AIR 1984 SC 1714, where the Supreme Court held that the Civil Court will have no jurisdiction to decide the issue arising in a suit instituted before the commencement of the Citizenship Act, 1955 as the Central Government alone has been constituted as exclusive forum for the same. Keeping in view these facts and provisions of law, the High Court declined to interfere with the order of the District Court and opined that no substantial questions of law had arisen for consideration.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that if cognizance has been taken on a police report, then there is no need to pass a fully reasoned order if from the perusal of the cognizance order it appears that the court has applied its mind to the materials on record. It may be noted that a Police Report means a report forwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate under Section 173 (2)... The Allahabad High Court has observed that if cognizance has been taken on a police report, then there is no need to pass a fully reasoned order if from the perusal of the cognizance order it appears that the court has applied its mind to the materials on record.  It may be noted that a Police Report means a report forwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate under Section 173 (2) CrPC. The bench of Justice Sameer Jain also clarified that even if there is an irregularity in the cognizance order passed by the Court, then also, on that ground, the proceedings cannot be vitiated in view of Section 465 Cr.P.C. It may be noted that Section 465 of CrPC states that no finding, sentence or order of a competent court shall be reversed on account of irregularity unless there is a failure of justice. The case in brief The Court was essentially dealing with a 482 CrPC plea filed to quash a charge sheet as well as cognizance/summoning order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate-IV, Etawah and the enitre proceedings of a case under Sections 323, 504, 506, 308 IPC. Before the Court, the petitioner's primary argument was that the cognizance order passed by the ACJM-IV, Etawah was bad, cryptic in nature, and passed on a printed proforma and that the same was passed without any application of mind.  On the other hand, the State's counsel argued that since the instant case was a State case, therefore, there was no need to pass a detailed cognizance order and thus, the Court below had validly passed the same. It was underscored before the Court that while passing the cognizance order, the court had perused the case diary and other documents and pieces of evidence collected by the Investigating Officer during the investigation, and thus, there was no illegality in the cognizance order. Court's observations  At the outset, relying upon the Apex Court's rulings in the cases of State of Gujarat Vs. Afroz Mohammad Hasanfatta (2019) 20 SCC 539 and Pradeep S. Wodeyar Vs. The State of Karnataka LL 2021 SC 691, the Court observed that since in the instant case, the cognizance was taken on a police report, therefore, there was no need for the Court below to pass a fully reasoned order. "In the present case, cognizance order dated 20.03.2020 shows that while passing it, the court below perused the charge-sheet, case diary and other documents, which were collected by the Investigating Officer during investigation and thereafter court was of the view that prima facie ground for taking cognizance is sufficient, therefore, it cannot be said that without perusing the materials on record, court below took the cognizance," the Court remarked. [emphasis supplied] Further, the Court also noted that even if there had been an irregularity in the cognizance order, then also, on the basis of it, the proceedings couldn't have been quashed as, the Court added, "the order of taking cognizance are interlocutory in nature and as per Section 465 Cr.P.C. proceedings on the basis of that irregularity cannot be vitiated. It may be noted that in Pradeep S. Wodeyar case (supra), the apex court had also observed that an irregularity in the order taking cognizance will not vitiate the proceedings in a criminal trial. Lastly, perusing the charge sheet and other documents on record, the Court found that prima facie, offence under Section 323, 504, 506, and 308 IPC was made out against the applicants, therefore, it concluded that there was no illegality in the charge sheet filed against the applicants.

Ocular evidence is considered the best evidence unless there are reasons to doubt it, the Supreme Court observed while setting aside an order of High Court that acquitted an accused in a murder case. The bench comprising Justices Navin Sinha and R. Subhash Reddy observed that the ocular evidence may be disbelieved only when there is a gross contradiction between medical evidence and oral evidence, and the medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable and rules out all possibility of ocular evidence being true. In this case, the High Court had reversed the Trial Court order convicting the accused on the ground that the evidence of the eye­witnesses is inconsistent with the medical evidence, regarding the nature of injuries vis­à­vis the weapons of offence. The bench, referring to evidence on record, addressed the contention that identification was not possible in the night to give them the benefit of doubt. "There is evidence about the availability of light near the place of occurrence. Even otherwise, that there may not have been any source of light is hardly considered relevant in view of the fact that the parties were known to each other from earlier. The criminal jurisprudence developed in this country recognizes that the eye sight capacity of those who live in rural areas is far better than compared to the town folks. Identification at night between known persons is acknowledged to be possible by voice, silhouette, shadow, and gait also. Therefore, we do not find much substance in the submission of the respondents that identification was not possible in the night to give them the benefit of doubt. " [relied on Nathuni Yadav vs State of Bihar, (1998) 9 SCC 238] The court also observed that the High Court grossly erred in appreciation of evidence by holding that the alleged weapon was a simple iron rod without noticing the evidence that it had a sharp turn edge. : "17. Ocular evidence is considered the best evidence unless there are reasons to doubt it. The evidence of PW­2 and PW­10 is unimpeachable. It is only in a case where there is a gross contradiction between medical evidence and oral evidence, and the medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable and rules out all possibility of ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved. In the present case, we find no inconsistency between the ocular and medical evidence. The High Court grossly erred in appreciation of evidence by holding that muddamal no.5 was a simple iron rod without noticing the evidence that it had a sharp turn edge." While restoring the conviction recorded by the Trial Court, the bench said that the acquittal by the High Court is based on misappreciation of  the evidence and the overlooking of relevant evidence thereby arriving at a wrong conclusion. "18...It is not a case where two views are possible or the credibility of the witnesses is in doubt. Neither is it a case of a solitary uncorroborated witness. The conclusion of the High Court is therefore held to be perverse and irrational. The acquittal is therefore held to be unsustainable and is set aside. In the nature of the assault, Section 304 Part II, IPC has no application.", the court said.  The bench also directed the accused to surrender within two weeks to serve out the remaining period of their sentence.      
The Karnataka High Court has made it clear that workmen employed at the Indian Coffee Workers Co-operative Society Limited, if not paid minimum wages as prescribed, can make an application to the appropriate authority constituted under the Minimum Wages Act to consider their claim for recovery of minimum wages. Further, it has said that Section 70 of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 does not impose any embargo on an authority under the Minimum Wages Act to consider the claim.  A single judge Justice Suraj Govindaraj made the observation while dismissing a petition filed by the society seeking to declare the order passed dated 27-10-2021 passed by the authority, by which it directed the society for payment of minimum wages to the workmen.  The primary contention of the society challenging the order was that the authority under the Minimum Wages Act has no jurisdiction and/or authority to decide any dispute and/or claim made by the workmen as regards the Co-operative Society in view of the amendment which has been brought about to Section 70 of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 in the year 2000.  Subsequent to the said amendment, any dispute as regards any claim of an workmen/ employee as regards wages or otherwise would have to be referred to the Registrar for decision and no Civil or Labour or Revenue Court or Industrial Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction to entertain any suit or other proceedings in respect of such dispute. The workmen opposed the plea contending that Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is a Special Enactment, which has been enacted with the purpose and intent of securing the wages of a workmen and being a Special Enactment, the same would have to be given preference over the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 and/or the amendment made thereto and as such. The workmen cannot be deprived of the mechanism prescribed under the said enactment. The bench noted that Section 70 of the Act deals with a dispute which are to be referred to the Registrar for a decision which includes in terms of Section 70(1)(c) of the Act, dispute between the Society, any officer, agent or employee. Any such dispute shall be referred to the Registrar for decision and no Civil, Labour or Revenue Court or Industrial Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or other proceedings in respect of such dispute.  Then referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Minimum Wages Act the bench observed “There is no justification for payment of wages less than the minimum wages and further that an organisation which pays less than minimum wages have no right to exist.”  Thus it opined “The dispute which has been referred to in Section 70 of the Act cannot cover the non-payment of wages under the Minimum Wages Act, inasmuch as there is no dispute which requires determination.”  It added “It is only the implementation of the Minimum Wages Act, which is required to be done. In the event of the employer making payment of minimum wages, no order needs to be passed. However, in the event of the employer not making payment of minimum wages, there would be a direction required to be issued to the employer to make payment of the minimum wages.”  Remarking that the context of dispute which has been used in Section 70 of the Act is different from a claim for minimum wages which is the case in the present matter. The bench said “In the present case, the claim is for minimum wages in a scheduled employment, the minimum wages being notified by the Appropriate Government. If the said payment is not made, then a claim for recovery of the amount could be made under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.”  Accordingly it dismissed the petition and upheld the order of the authority and said “The workmen are entitled to work out their remedy before the appropriate forum.” Case Title: Indian Coffee Workers Cooperative Society Limited And The Senior Labour Inspector & Others  Case no: WRIT PETITION NO. 22751 OF 2021 Date of Order: 07-02-2023 Appearance: Somashekar, Advocate for petitioner.

In a significant order, the Supreme Court on Friday directed that each protected forest should have an Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of 1 kilometre. The Court further directed that no permanent structure will be allowed within the ESZ. Mining within national wildlife sanctuary or national park cannot be permitted. If the existing ESZ goes beyond 1 km buffer zone or if any statutory instrument prescribes a higher limit, then such extended boundary shall prevail. A bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and Aniruddha Bose passed the directions in applications filed in the TN Godavarman Thirumalpad case. Justice Bose read out the operative portion of the judgment. The Chief Conservator of Forests of each state has been directed to make a list of subsisting structures at the ESZs and submit a report to the court within 3 months period. The present set of applications arose out of a report of the Central Empwered Committee (CEC which was constituted by the Court in 2002) dated 20th November 2003. This report specifically pertains to Jamua Ramgarh wildlife sanctuary. This sanctuary covers an area of about 300 square kilometres. The Court noted that the said report gave a horrific picture of ravaging of a protected forest mainly by private miners mostly with temporary working permits obtained from the Governmental agencies. On 20th September 2012, a second report was submitted by the CEC. The recommendations made in the second report went beyond the Jamua Ramgarh Sanctuary and dealt with creation of identification and declaration of safety zones around protected forests all across the country. The question of having ESZ around the protected forests was examined by this Court earlier in another Writ Petition [W.P. (Civil) No. 460 of 2004] in Goa Foundation v. Union of India, in which certain directions were passed on 4th December 2006 [reported in (2011) 15 SCC 791. A set of Guidelines for Declaration of Eco­Sensitive Zones (ESZ) around National Park and Wildlife Sanctuaries had been formulated by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) of the Government of India on 9th February 2011 [F. No.1­9/2007 WL – I (pt)]. These Guidelines deal with the process and procedures to be adopted for declaring ESZ.  In the present order, passed in a set of applications filed by the miners, the Court held that the guidelines issued on February 9, 2011 are "reasonable". The following are the directions issued : (a )Each protected forest, that is national park or wildlife sanctuary must have an ESZ of minimum one kilometre measured from the demarcated boundary of such protected forest in which the activities proscribed and prescribed in the Guidelines of 9th February 2011 shall be strictly adhered to. For Jamua Ramgarh wildlife sanctuary, it shall be 500 metres so far as subsisting activities are concerned. (b) In the event, however, the ESZ is already prescribed as per law that goes beyond one kilometre buffer zone, the wider margin as ESZ shall prevail. If such wider buffer zone beyond one kilometre is proposed under any statutory instrument for a particular national park or wildlife sanctuary awaiting final decision in that regard, then till such final decision is taken, the ESZ covering the area beyond one kilometre as proposed shall be maintained. (c) The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests as also the Home Secretary of each State and Union Territory shall remain responsible for proper compliance of the said Guidelines as regards nature of use within the ESZ of all national parks and sanctuaries within a particular State or Union Territory. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests for each State and Union Territory shall also arrange to make a list of subsisting structures and other relevant details within the respective ESZs forthwith and a report shall be furnished before this Court by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of each State and Union Territory within a period of three months. For this purpose, such authority shall be entitled to take assistance of any governmental agency for satellite imaging or photography using drones. (d) Mining within the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries shall not be permitted. (e) In the event any activity is already being undertaken within the one kilometre or extended buffer zone (ESZ), as the case may be, of any wildlife sanctuary or national park which does not come within the ambit of prohibited activities as per the 9th February 2011 Guidelines, such activities may continue with permission of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of each State or Union Territory and the person responsible for such activities in such a situation shall obtain necessary permission within a period of six months. Such permission shall be given once the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests is satisfied that the activities concerned do not come within the prohibited list and were continuing prior to passing of this order in a legitimate manner. No new permanent structure shall be permitted to come up for whatsoever purpose within the ESZ. (f) The minimum width of the ESZ may be diluted in overwhelming public interest but for that purpose the State or Union Territory concerned shall approach the CEC and MoEF&CC and both these bodies shall give their respective opinions/recommendations before this Court. On that basis, this Court shall pass appropriate order. (g) In the event the CEC, MoEF&CC, the Standing Committee of National Board of Wildlife or any other body of persons or individual having special interest in environmental issues consider it necessary for maintaining a wider or larger ESZ in respect of any national park or wildlife sanctuary, such body or individual shall approach the CEC. In such a situation the CEC shall be at liberty to examine the need of a wider ESZ in respect of any national park or wildlife sanctuary in consultation with all the stakeholders including the State or Union Territory concerned, MoEF&CC as also the Standing Committee of National Board of Wildlife and then approach this Court with its recommendations. (h) In respect of sanctuaries or national parks for which the proposal of a State or Union Territory has not been given, the 10 kilometres buffer zone as ESZ, as indicated in the order passed by this Court on 4th December 2006 in the case of Goa Foundation (supra) and also contained in the Guidelines of 9th February 2011 shall be implemented. Within that area, the entire set of restrictions concerning an ESZ shall operate till a final decision in that regard is arrived at. Case Title : In Re : TN Godavarman Thirumalpad versus Union of India  Headnotes | Environment( Protection) Act 1986 - Section 3 - Guidelines issued by the Union Ministry on February 9 2011 for Ecologically Sensitive Zones near protected forests held to be reasonable - Further directions issued in relation to ESZ -No new permanent structure shall be permitted to come up for whatsoever purpose within the ESZ - Mining within the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries shall not be permitted.  
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has ruled that Provident Fund, Pension, Insurance, bank balance, shares, fixed deposits, etc., are all pecuniary advantages receivable by heirs on account of one's death but all these have no correlation with the amount receivable as compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, a statute occasioned only on account of accidental death. A... The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has ruled that Provident Fund, Pension, Insurance, bank balance, shares, fixed deposits, etc., are all pecuniary advantages receivable by heirs on account of one's death but all these have no correlation with the amount receivable as compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, a statute occasioned only on account of accidental death.  A bench comprising Justice Vinod Chaterjee Koul observed,  "The main reason is that all these amounts are earned by deceased on account of contractual relations entered into by him with others. It cannot be said that these amounts have accrued to dependents or legal heirs of deceased on account of his death in a motor vehicle accident. The claimants/ dependents are entitled to just compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act as a result of death of deceased in a motor vehicle accident."  The bench was hearing an appeal against an award passed by Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Kupwara on a Claim petition whereby the tribunal had directed the appellant Insurance Company to pay compensation in the amount of Rs. 32,43,212/- along with 7.5% interest per annum from the date of institution of claim till realization, on the grounds made mention of therein.  The appellants challenged the award inter alia primarily on the ground that the tribunal had failed to consider that deceased was a government employee, working in Forest Department as Junior Assistant and posted in Forest Division, Kupwara, which implied that his legal heirs would be entitled to full salary for a period of seven years and, therefore, it was incumbent upon the Tribunal to take into consideration the said fact while assessing the payment of compensation, but this aspect was ignored by the Tribunal while passing impugned Award.  Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Koul observed that the deductions cannot be allowed from the amount of compensation either on account of insurance, or on account of pensionary benefits or gratuity or grant of employment to kin of deceased. The bench underscored.  "The claimants/ dependents are entitled to just compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act as a result of death of deceased in a motor vehicle accident. Thus, the natural corollary is that the advantage that accrues to the estate of deceased or to his dependents as a result of some contract or act which deceased performed in his life time cannot be said to be the outcome or result of death of deceased even though these amounts may go into the hands of dependents only after his death", the bench explained.  Deliberating further on the said proposition of law the bench observed that it is now an established principle of service jurisprudence that pension and gratuity are the property of deceased and they are more in the nature of deferred wages. The deceased employee works throughout his life expecting that on his retirement he will get substantial amount as pension and gratuity and these amounts are also payable on death, whatever be the cause of death. Therefore, applying the same principles, the said amount cannot be deducted, the court maintained.  In order to buttress the stand taken the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations made by Supreme Court in Helen C. Rebello (Mrs) and others v. Maharashtra State Transport Corporation and another, (1999) wherein SC held that any sorts of funds receivable by heirs on account of one's death have no correlation with the amount receivable under a statute occasioned only on account of accidental death. Such an amount will not come within the periphery of the Motor Vehicles Act, to be termed as pecuniary advantage liable for deduction and that family pension is also earned by an employee for benefit of his family in the form of his contribution in the service in terms of the service conditions receivable by heirs after his death and heirs receive family pension even otherwise than accidental death.  Elaborating further the bench examined various SC judgements and reiterated that compassionate appointment in the case of death of an employee in harness, could also not be stated to be an advantage receivable by heirs on account of one's death and had no correlation with amount receivable under a statute occasioned on account of accidental death. Compassionate appointment may have nexus with death of an employee while in service but it is not necessary that it should have a correlation with accidental death, the bench recorded.  "I have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions made by learned counsel for respondents/claimants and do not find any merit in the Appeal as the Tribunal has given just compensation in favour of claimants and the same does not warrant any interference," the bench concluded while dismissing the appeal.

The Karnataka High Court has made it clear that even if a person was intoxicated or smelling with alcohol, the same cannot be an excuse for the driver of a bus for causing the road traffic accident and causing injuries to the injured person. A single judge bench of Justice Dr H B Prabhakara Sastry allowed the petition filed by claimant Murugan T and set aside the order rejecting the claim petition filed by the petition and remanded the matter back to the Tribunal for consideration of the issue regarding entitlement of compensation to the claimant and quantum and from whom.  The bench said “The claimant who claims to be the injured in the road traffic accident in question, was intoxicated or smelling with alcohol, but the same cannot be an excuse for the driver of the offending Bus for causing the road traffic accident, causing injuries to the injured person.”  The tribunal had vide its order dated 05-07-2019, dismissed the claim petition on the grounds that the claimant was intoxicated with alcohol and at the time of the accident was standing near the footpath, but leaving the footpath on the edge of the road,held that there is no negligence on the part of the driver of the Bus.  The petitioner contended that mere smelling of alcohol cannot be a ground to hold that the accident in question has taken place solely due to the negligence of the claimant himself. Further, it was said “The said driver has pleaded guilty in the criminal case registered by the police and the matter came to be closed. Thus, when the driver himself has pleaded guilty for the alleged offences punishable under Sections 279 and 338 of the IPC and was penalised accordingly and also PW-1 has led the evidence to the effect of establishing the rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver of the offending Bus, the Tribunal was at an error.”  The bench went through the records and noted only respondent (insurer) before the Tribunal in the matter had filed its Written Statement, it had not taken the contention of the alleged intoxication of the complainant(claimant) at the time of the alleged road traffic accident.  It said “As such, what was not pleaded by the parties, the Tribunal has attempted to notice on its own and base its entire reasoning for rejecting the claim petition of the claimant.”  Rejecting the grounds of the tribunal in refusing the claim the bench said, “No doubt, a perusal of the Wound Certificate mentions the presence of 'smell of alcohol'. A mentioning to the same effect is also there in the case sheet of the Wenlock Hospital. The said observation, in the Wound Certificate, except stating that there was smell of alcohol, nowhere mentions as to whether the claimant who was a patient before the examining Doctor was intoxicated with alcohol.”  It then held “It is not even shown as to whether the alleged smell of the alcohol was coming from the mouth of the alleged injured person. As such, the source of the smell of alcohol, whether it was from the body of the injured or from the dress worn by him, has not been mentioned by the Doctor. However, the Tribunal assumed itself that mere mentioning of the 'smell of alcohol' as the conclusive proof of the claimant/patient consuming alcohol at the time of the alleged road traffic accident.”  Further it said “Even according to the Tribunal, it is not its finding that, by consuming alcohol, the claimant had fallen unconscious on the road and that he had inadvertently moved his feet and put his left foot beneath the back wheel of the offending Bus. On the contrary, the Tribunal itself has observed that he was standing on the side of the road just next to the footpath.”  Thus it said “The claimant might have consumed liquor, still, he was in such a position of controlling himself and was able to stand properly on his legs. As such, any contribution on the part of the claimant in the road traffic accident also cannot be imagined or arrived at.”  Noting that it is the primary duty of the driver of any Motor Vehicle to drive the vehicle with utmost care and caution, that too, particularly, in a public place like a Bus Stand.  The court observed “Any driver of a Motor Vehicle, including a passenger vehicle like the Bus in the instant case, is required to be more cautious and careful while driving a Bus. As such, even for the sake of argument, if it is taken that the claimant was intoxicated with alcohol, it does not give any permission for the driver to run the Bus on the foot of that person.”  Refusing to accept the reason assigned by the Tribunal that as it is the back wheel of the Bus that is said to have run over the foot of the claimant, no negligence can be attributed on the part of the driver of the Bus.  The bench said “A driver, while driving the vehicle, would not consider the vehicle into two parts, as the front part with front wheel and the back part with the back wheel, which are under his control. When he drives the vehicle, the whole vehicle is required to be under his control and that he should drive the entire vehicle in such care and caution that it shall not lead to any untoward incident like the road traffic accident as in the instant case.”  It added “It is such care and caution that is expected of a driver of any Motor vehicle. Therefore, no exception can be given that the driver cannot be held as negligent when the back wheel of a heavy passenger vehicle is said to have passed on the leg of a pedestrian.”  It was also opined that “A standing person was taken to be seen by the driver who was driving a passenger Bus in the premises of a Bus Stand, as such, he should have been more vigilant and cautious in driving the said Bus. Therefore, the reasoning given by the Tribunal that there was no negligence on the part of the driver of the alleged offending Bus is not acceptable.”  Further, taking into account that the accused driver pleaded guilty for the alleged offences and was sentenced. The bench said “This fact also was not taken into consideration by the Tribunal. As such, the road traffic accident, as alleged in the claim petition by the claimant, is not only proved but also proved that the said road traffic accident has occurred solely due to the rash and negligent driving by the driver.”  Following which it remanded the matter back to the tribunal for considering the issue regarding whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation? If so, what quantum and from whom? Case Title: Murugan T And P. Jayagovinda Bhat & ANR  Case No: MISCELLANEOUS FIRST APPEAL NO. 554 OF 2020 Date of Order: 28-02-2023 Appearance: Advocate G.

The Delhi High Court has restrained Narinder Dhruv Batra from discharging functions as President of Indian Olympic Association. A vacation bench comprising of Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma added that the Senior Vice President will take over the duties and responsibilities of the President and shall also perform any other tasks or functions as directed by the President, the Executive Council or the General Meeting. "This Court considers that the functioning of Sports Federation should be above any kind of doubt. The purity in the functioning of such federations are much more important, than the individual who hold the positions," the Court observed.  The Court was dealing with a plea filed by one Aslam Sher Khan seeking contempt proceedings against the various Respondents, for wilful disobedience and deliberate defiance of the Judgment dated May 25, 2022 passed by the Court.  The counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that Batra was removed from the position in National Sports Federation (NSF) by virtue of the said judgment.  It was added that Batra had committed contempt of the court by continuing as President of Indian Olympic Association and could not be allowed to further perpetuate contempt.  It was also submitted that other respondent authorities had also committed Contempt of Court by taking part in the proceedings conducted by Batra as President despite the judicial order.  Court's attention was invited to para 16.2 of Rules and Regulations Of The Indian Olympic Association which provides that in the absence of the President, one of the Senior Vice Presidents approved by the Executive Council shall preside over the meetings. While issuing notice on the plea, the Court observed: "Whether Mr.Batra is appointed as President, lndian Olympic Association (lOA) only by virtue of being the Life Member of Hockey lndia or if he is holding the position by virtue of some other position in FIH or Associate Vice President in Hockey India is required to be seen in light of the judgment passed by this court in W.P (C) No. 5703 of 2020." The matter will now be heard by a Roaster Bench on 3rd August, 2022. Case Title: ASLAM SHER KHAN v. NARINDER DHRUV BATRA & ORS.

A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka... The Karnataka High Court has held that it is the duty of the authorities to ensure that the footways and public streets are kept free of obstructions including illegal parking thereon. It is also their responsibility to ensure that violations of the aforesaid provisions of law are not taken casually and criminal law is promptly set in motion.  A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, relying on the order passed by the court on 31st July 2019 in W.P.No.42927/2015, said "This Court has held that a right to have streets including footways in a good and reasonable condition will have to be held as an essential part of the fundamental rights conferred on the citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. If the footways or public streets are encroached upon in any manner including by parking of vehicles, it will amount to violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India as held by this Court."  The court has also directed the state government and the traffic Police Department to make effective implementation of the provisions contained in Sections 117, 122, 127, 177A and 201 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, on a complaint made by a citizen or otherwise. If any violation of the said provisions is made, apart from taking action of removal of illegally stopped, parked or abandoned vehicles on footways, criminal law must be set in motion immediately.  It added "The respondents shall ensure strict implementation of the provisions of the Karnataka Traffic Control Act, of 1960 and the Karnataka Traffic Control Rules of 1979."  Further, it said "It is the duty of the State Government and its agencies and instrumentalities to ensure that the relevant provisions under the M.V. Act, the said Act of 1960, the rules framed under the said Act of 1960 as well as the Regulations framed under Section 118 of the M.V.  Act concerning footways are strictly implemented. They shall ensure that criminal law is promptly set in motion against the offenders and violators;  The court has directed the State Government as well as the BBMP to issue directions to its officers for the purpose of implementation of the above directions within a period of six weeks.  The court opined that all the penal provisions which we have discussed above must be scrupulously enforced by all the concerned. It said "Unless the penal provisions are properly enforced, the aforesaid provisions of law will remain only on paper."  It concluded by saying "Non implementation of the aforesaid provisions which we have discussed in the body of the judgment may even amount to violation of right to life guaranteed to the citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution of India."  Court suggests increasing the fine amount  A reference was made to Section 18 of the Karnataka Traffic Control Act of 1960 under which any violation of the provisions of the said Act of 1960 or of any Rule made thereunder is an offence. The court said "Unfortunately, a very mild punishment is prescribed of fine which may extend to ten rupees or in case of successive offence, it may extend to fifty rupees.  Accordingly it suggested "This is a legislation of 1960. We hope and trust that the Legislature will consider whether Section 18 needs an amendment for providing for stringent punishments."  The order was passed while disposing of a petition filed by Advocate D. S. RAMACHANDRA REDDY inviting the attention of the Court to the encroachments made on foot paths/ footways in a particular location in Bengaluru city. Further, seeking a direction of the court for making a particular street for one-way street and for ensuring that all road signals are erected. Click Hear To Download/Read Order   
The Allahabad High Court has observed that in rent disputes, it is no concern of the Courts to dictate to the landlord how, and in what manner, he/she should live or prescribe for him/her a residential standard of their own.Referring to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Prativa Devi (Smt.) Vs. T.V. Krishnan 1996 (5) SCC 353, the Bench of Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal also stressed... The Allahabad High Court has observed that in rent disputes, it is no concern of the Courts to dictate to the landlord how, and in what manner, he/she should live or prescribe for him/her a residential standard of their own. Referring to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Prativa Devi (Smt.) Vs. T.V. Krishnan 1996 (5) SCC 353, the Bench of Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal also stressed that the landlord is the best judge of his residential requirement and that there is no law that deprives the landlord of beneficial enjoyment of his/her property. The HC observed thus as it dismissed a writ plea moved by a Lawyer/Tenant against the ordered of the Prescribed Authority/Additional District Judge allowing the release application of the respondents/landlord. The facts in brief Essentially, the landlord-respondents no.1 to 3 filed a Rent Case under Section 21(1)(a) of The U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act 1972 for releasing the accommodation in dispute which is a residential portion purchased by the landlord-respondents in 2006 from its previous owner. The landlord sought the release of the petitioner/Tenant-lawyer from the accommodation in question on the ground that their family was growing up, and therefore, there stood personal need for the landlord and their family members, as each one of them required separate room for living. On the other hand, the tenant-petitioner contested the said release application by arguing that there existed no need of the landlord and that they were having other accommodation, wherein their needs could be satisfied. The trial Court found that the need of the landlord-respondents was not genuine and bona fide and the comparative hardship tilted in favour of the tenant and therefore, the release application of the landlord was rejected. Against this, the landlord-respondents moved a rent appeal which was allowed. Now against the order in the rent appeal, the tenant-petitioner/lawyer moved to the High Court with his Writ plea.  It was his specific plea that the landlord-respondents were having number of alternate accommodation with them in the city of Badaun, wherein their need could be satisfied and this fact was ignored in the rent appeal by the Prescribed Authority/Additional District Judge. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the appellate Court had recorded a categorical finding to the effect that landlord-respondents were in fact, not having any alternative accommodation in their exclusive possession. The Court also took into account the fact that the alternative accommodation brought on record by the tenant-petitioner was, in fact, in the exclusive ownership of the father of the landlord-respondents and one of the accommodation was under the dispute. Further, the Court also referred to an array of judgments of the Apex Court to stress upon the scope of bona fide and genuine need of a landlord. The Court also udnerscored that in such cases, a balance should be maintained between the need of a tenant and the landlord. Against this backdrop, having analysed the judgment of the appellate Court, the Court came to the conclusion that the appellate Court had dealt with the matter as regards the alternate accommodation alleged to be with the landlord-respondents by the tenant.  "The appellate Court had recorded specific finding on each aspect and found the need of the landlordrespondents to be genuine and bona fide as the family are growing up and consisted of 9 members, while in his possession only the western portion of the accommodation which was purchased in the year 2013 was there and accommodation was needed for the family members. The finding recorded by the Court below is the finding of fact which needs no interference by this Court," the Court observed as it DISMISSED the writ plea while underscoring that the comparative hardship tilted in favour of the landlords. However, considering the facts and circumstances the facts that the tenant-petitioner is a practising lawyer at Badaun and residing in the disputed accommodation since long, the Court granted him six months' time to vacate the premises in question with certain conditions.   
The Delhi High Court on Friday permitted BJP MLA Vijender Gupta to attend the Delhi Legislative Assembly on Monday, the last day of the budget session till remainder of the session and directed him to maintain the dignity of the House.  Justice Prathiba M Singh disposed of Gupta’s plea challenging the motion passed by Assembly suspending him from attending the sittings of the House for one year till the next Budget Session.   His suspension came into effect on March 21. Perusing the summary of proceedings of the House of the relevant day, the court said that there was disturbance caused by both Gupta and the members of the ruling party.  “There is no gainsaying that the Members of the Legislative Assembly or any other elected house have to maintain dignity of the house in order to play a positive role owing to the mandate of the people. only be gainsaid that the members of a legislative assembly or an elected house have to maintain the dignity,” Justice Singh observed.  Senior Advocate Jayant Mehta, appearing for Gupta, placed reliance on Rule 272 of Rules of Procedure & Conduct of Business, Legislative Assembly of National Capital Territory of Delhi which states that the suspension of a member has to be done in a “graded manner.” He submitted that on first occasion, the suspension can be ordered for three sittings only. For second occasion, a member can be suspended for seven sittings and for another occasion, it can be for the remainder of the session, he told court.  However, Mehta argued that Gupta has been suspended for a year which is not in accordance with the provision. It was also submitted that the debate arose due to a motion moved by Gupta with respect to the selective publication of a part of the budget. Mehta also relied on a Supreme Court judgment to contend that the graded suspension in terms of the Rules alone can be followed. On the other hand, Advocate Samir Vashisht, appearing for the Delhi government, placed reliance on section 37 of GNCTD Act, 1991 to submit that the suspension cannot be inquired into by any court.   He also submitted that Gupta’s suspension was done by the House itself and not the speaker and therefore, the House is fully empowered to issue a punishment of higher nature.  Perusing the Rules and judgment of the Supreme Court, the court said that Rule 272 clearly states that the suspension has to be done in graded manner. “The Budget Session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is currently ongoing and the Petitioner has already remained suspended for four days i.e. 21st March, 2023; 22nd March, 2023; 23rd March, 2023 and 24th March, 2023 in view of the impugned suspension order. A perusal of the summary of proceedings extracted above shows that there was disturbance caused during the sitting of the House both by the Petitioner, as also by ruling party members,” the court observed. It added: “The record of the proceedings shows that this was the first suspension which was meted out to the Petitioner. Accordingly, in terms of Rule 227(3)(b), the suspension could have only to be for a period of three days which the Petitioner has already served in effect.” While disposing of the plea, Justice Singh however said that the question of law raised by Vashishth with respect to Rule 77 and Rule 277 are left open to be decided in an appropriate manner. Gupta was also represented by Advocates Pavan Narang, Neeraj and Satya Ranjan Swain. It was submitted in the plea that the order passed by the Speaker of Delhi Assembly is unjust, unfair and unreasonable. The petition saud that the order is non est and violates the “Rules of Procedure & Conduct of Business, Legislative Assembly of National Capital Territory of Delhi.” “…the impugned action of the Hon'ble Speaker in permitting a ruling party MLA to move and proceed with the Motion to seek suspension of the Petitioner from the House for a period of one year does not come within the definition of irregular proceedings' but in fact is a classic case of being categorized as 'gross illegal' and "unconstitutional' but also contravention / violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioner under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India,” the plea contended.

The Bombay High Court allowed a man’s application seeking transfer of domestic violence proceedings from the magistrate’s court to the family court, where he has filed a divorce petition. The court said it would not be inconvenient for the wife as both are in the same city. Justice Amit Borkar held that there is a possibility of conflicting verdicts and transfer will reduce the burden of one court. “There is the possibility of conflicting verdicts by two courts, and transfer will reduce the burden of one Court resulting in saving of judicial time; and moreover, the transfer of proceedings will not cause inconvenience to the wife as she will not have to travel outside Pune, therefore, for the aforesaid reasons, in my opinion, both miscellaneous civil applications deserve to be allowed”. The husband claimed that primary evidence in his divorce case and his wife’s case under Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (DV Act) is the same. The efficacy of cross examination would be undermined if both are conducted separately, he argued. Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud for the wife relied on Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail v. Manisha Abhijeet Jail and submitted that the transfer would take away her statutory right to appeal under section 29 of the Act and also take away her right of speedy disposal.  It was also submitted that subsequent judgments of the High Court are "in ignorance" of Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail and hence the question should be referred to a larger bench.  Advocate Abhijeet Sarwate with Advocate Ajinkya Udane for the husband submitted that it is a consistent view of the court that the proceedings under DV Act can be transferred to the Family Court Justice Borkar said that it has consistently been held that proceedings under the DV Act can be transferred to the family court as it can effectively try and grant the relief sought. The family courts are empowered to deal with the reliefs under sections 18 to 22 of the DV Act, the court said, while referring to the precdednt.  In Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail, the court had rejected the husband’s transfer application on four grounds, two of which were that transferring the proceedings will take away the right of speedy justice under the DV Act and, the transfer would take away the statutory right of appeal available to the wife. The court said that only the ratio decidendi constitutes a binding president. The court applied the inversion test to find out the ratio in Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail case. The court said that even if the reason that transferring proceedings would take away the right of speedy justice is taken away, the single judge would still have arrived at the same decision based on the other reasons. Hence that reason does not constitute the ratio of the judgement, it added. The court relied on Sandip Mrinmoy Chakrabarty v. Reshita Sandip Chakrabarty in which the division bench concluded that the family court appeal challenging common order arising out of proceedings under the DV Act and Family Courts Act would be maintainable. Thus, the court said that the judgement in Abhijeet Prabhakar Jail does not hold ground in view of the division bench judgement in Sandip Mrinmoy Chakrabarty. Since it is the consistent view of various single judges of the court that proceedings under the DV act can be transferred to the family court, the court said that it is unnecessary to refer the matter to a larger bench. “The consistent view of various Single Judges of this Court that proceedings under the DV Act can be transferred to the Family Court constrains me to hold it is unnecessary to refer the matter to the Larger Bench because the position of law on the point appears to have been settled by the aforesaid decisions.” Case no. – Miscellaneous Civil Application No. 498 of 2022 Case Title – X v.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed by the Chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) seeking a direction upon the Election Commission of India (ECI) to compensate each of the families of the children who have lost their lives due to Covid-19 following the announcement of the general elections in... The Calcutta High Court on Friday dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed by the Chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) seeking a direction upon the Election Commission of India (ECI) to compensate each of the families of the children who have lost their lives due to Covid-19 following the announcement of the general elections in the State on February 26, 2021.  The plea had stated that the plight of children affected by Covid-19 in the State was the direct outcome of the insensible decision of the election commission to conduct the general election in the state in eight phases despite predictions made by several organizations and medical experts regarding the second COVID wave.  A Division Bench comprising Justice Harish Tandon and Justice Soumen Sen dismissed the petition for being 'premature' after noting that the State Commission had not utilised its powers under Section 15 of the Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 (Act) to conduct an enquiry and ascertain if the cause of death is due to any negligent conduct of the election commission.  "In the instant case admittedly, there is no inquiry initiated by the State Commission in terms of Section 15 of the said Act. We could not find any plausible explanation from the writ petitioner for not exercising the said power. When a State Commission is empowered to carry on such investigation and inquiry and ascertain the cause of death it is expected that such enquiry should be conducted first before approaching a constitutional court with such findings and implementations of its recommendations if Government concerned failed to implement such recommendations. Death of any person including a child is unfortunate and undesirable whatever the reasons may be for the cause of such death. A child is a precious asset. It is only expected that if there is any violation of a child's right the Commission would without delay invoke the provisions of the Act and take such measures and steps as they are expected to take under the said Act", the Court underscored.  The Bench further noted that no meeting had been conveyed by the Chairperson of the State Commission to look into cause of death of children during the election period and to find out the cause of such death. The Court further emphasised that the door of the Constitutional Court is not closed and that once the Commission arrives at a definite finding of negligence, it can always approach the Court with such findings and recommendations. The Court further observed that a conjoint reading of Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Act would show that the Commission is empowered to enquire into complaints and take suo motu cognizance of the violation of child rights. Reliance was also placed on the Gauhati High Court decision in National Commission for Protection of Child Rights v. State of Arunachal Pradesh in this regard.  "It is true that the inquiry is not in the nature of a criminal investigation but upon completion of the inquiry under Section 13(2) of the said Act the Commission could have approached the Supreme Court or the High Court concerned for appropriate directions", the Court opined.  Thus, the Court held that the writ petition is 'premature' as the petitioner without exhausting the powers conferred upon the commission under Section 13, 14 and 15 of the Act approached the writ court with reliefs which is only possible provided an inquiry under Section 13(2) is complete. Dismissing the plea, the Court observed,  "The chairperson has not given any cogent reason for not taking the other members of the commission into confidence and exercising powers under the aforesaid Sections. The writ petition is not for implementation of any recommendation of the State Commission. The fact finding authority without exercising and exhausting its power under the Act cannot approach the constitutional court directly. The petitioner cannot bypass the provision of the Act and directly invoke the writ jurisdiction. The writ petitioner being the Chairperson is expected to be aware of the powers and duties of the State Commission and it is only expected that the petitioner should invoke the powers under Sections 14 and 15 first and then with the recommendation approach the court."

In a bail hearing before the Allahabad High Court, it was revealed that the advocates appearing on behalf of the accused and the complainant were acting in collusion, wherein the counsel for the complainant had filed forged vakalatnama at the directions of the counsel for the accused.The counsel for the accused had 'arranged' a forged vakalatnama and engaged a lawyer to represent the accused to record no-objection to grant bail. Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh noted that the said action by long-standing counsels is highly deplorable, attacking the sanctity of the profession and the institution. As a remedial measure, the Court noted that a self-attested copy of any identity proof (preferably Aadhar Card) mentioning the person's mobile number should also be filed along with the Vakalatnama. After advancing the contentions on behalf of the accused, Advocate Ram Ker Singh told the Court that the complainant has no objection to granting of the sought bail. Mr. Hausila Prasad, purportedly representing the complainant, concurred that there is no opposition to the grant of bail. Advocate Vivek Kumar Singh, who was instructed by the complainant, then intervened to make a preliminary objection, apprising the Court that Advocate Hausala Prasad has filed forged Vakalatnama and that the informant has not engaged him. Informing that the said Vakalatnama is a forged document, he argued that Advocate Prasad filed his Vakalatnama on July 26, 2021, through e-mode in collaboration with Mr. Ram Ker Singh, learned counsel for the applicant to obtain bail by hook or crook. When the Court confronted Advocate Prasad, he stated that the said Vakalatnama was provided to him by Mr. Ram Ker Singh,  counsel for the applicant. He further submitted that he is associated with the counsel appearing for the applicant, and his fee to appear is also being provided by Mr. Singh. It was admitted that he was engaged in this manner so that the Court does not issue notices to the informant as the present matter pertains to Section 376(2)(i), 506 IPC, and 3/4 Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The Court noted that it is ostensibly clear that forged Vakalatnama has been filed on behalf of the informant/complainant to obtain bail surreptitiously. Mr. Prasad tendered his unconditional apology by stating that he will take care of such things and will not repeat such mistakes in the future and also stated that he wants to withdraw his Vakalatnama above. In contrast, Mr. Ram Ker Singh, learned counsel for the applicant, did not tender his apology and stated that it is common practice at the High Court. The Court expressed shock at the statement of Mr. Singh, noting that it is 'painful to the conscious,' which creates a stir compelling one to ponder over the matter. Condemning the said move, the Court noted that such an action by the advocates having a long-standing experience of the practice is highly deplorable, referring it to as an effort to tarnish the image of the noble profession of advocacy. The Court further noted that it is very painful to see the downfall in the moral values of the noble profession of advocacy. It remarked that professional ethics are a fundamental requirement in the legal field because it is an important tool that establishes the rule of law and keeps the legal profession and the legal institutions on a high pedestal. Emphasizing the sanctity of faith between the Bar and the Bench, the Court noted that ethics are an important factor, which contains discipline, fairness, trust, moral values, help to colleagues, respect and responsibilities, etc. The Court noted, "It creates confidence between the Bar and the Bench. Lawyers play a crucial role in the justice delivery system. In my view, professional ethics are the backbone of the legal profession, which is a self-regulating profession. It is the moral duty of the Bar and the Bench both to maintain the sanctity of legal profession and the institution." Noting that Vakalatnama must be beyond the shadow of any doubt, the Court noted that it is a valuable document in the legal profession, which empowers a lawyer to act for or on behalf of his client, sometimes conferring wide authority/power upon a lawyer.  As Advocate Prasad realized his mistake and accepted his guilt before the Court, no action was taken against him on his request. He was permitted to move an appropriate application to withdraw his Vakalatnama from this case. However, Advocate Singh, who provided forged Vakalatnama of the informant and provided fee for Advocate Prasad, neither tendered an oral apology nor did he feel regret on his conduct.  Noting that the Court cannot act as a silent spectator, the matter was referred to the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh for taking appropriate action/decision in the matter.  The Court also noted that the issue of filing a forged Vakalatnama of any person in a Court proceeding is a serious issue, as it is likely to affect the valuable legal right and interest of the persons/litigants concerned, ergo keeping in view, the larger interest of the litigants/victims, complainants or aggrieved persons especially in criminal matters and members of the Bar, who believe in professional ethics. The Court remarked that it is 'high time to adopt some remedial measures, so the litigants or aggrieved persons are not deprived of their legal rights. Following this observation, the Court proposed that along with Vakalatnama, a self-attested copy of any identity proof (preferably Aadhar Card) mentioning the person's mobile number should also be filed, or any other method may be adopted in the interest of litigants and the institution.

The Gujarat High Court has held that past services of the daily-wagers where they have completed 240 days of continuous service as per Section 25B of the Industrial Disputes Act, would qualify for pension. Justice Biren Vaishnav, heavily relying on the case of Executive Engineer, Panchayat v. Samudabhai Jyotibhai Phedi, held, "for counting the period for purposes of pension, the date of initial appointment needs to be taken into consideration and for the purposes of taking initial date of appointment those years in which the petitioners have completed 240 days have to be counted for the purposes of pension." The Court was hearing a petition seeking the revision of pension and the payment of gratuity from the date of initial appointment of the Petitioners along with arrears and additionally release the benefits of 300 days unavailed privilege leave in favour of the Petitioners as envisaged in the Government Resolution of 1988 with interest.  The Petitioners indicated that they had worked with the Respondents for more than three decades and pension payment orders were annexed for the purpose of counting pension from the date of regularisation.  The Petitioner contested that the issues raised before the High Court were already settled in the Executive Engineer, Panchayat (Maa & M) Department vs. Samudabhai Jyotibhai Bhedi., 2014(4) GLR 2952 matter. Per contra, the Respondent submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that the Petitioners had completed 240 days in each year of service from the date of initial appointment till they completed 10 years of service to avail the benefits.  The High Court referred to the decision of the Single Judge Bench in Samudabhai to hold:  "entire past services of daily-wager which was continuous is liable to be reckoned for the purpose of pensionary benefits and for the purpose of granting pension." It observed that petitioners are entitled to the pensionary benefits by reckoning the entire length of service from the date of initial joining for the purposes of pension and other terminal benefits. The respondents were therefore directed to fix the pension of the petitioners by counting their services from the date of their initial joining until the date of their retirement and in doing so each year of service preceding the date of regularization in which years the petitioners have completed 240 days shall only be considered for recalculating pension. The retirement benefits, except leave encashment benefit shall be paid to the petitioners within a period of eight weeks, the Court said. "As far as entitlement of the petitioners for leave encashment is concerned, the issue is pending and is at large before the Apex Court and learned advocate for the petitioner would concede that the issue regarding leave encashment can be dealt with at a later point of time depending on the outcome of the SLP, if occasion arises," the Court noted in its order.

The Supreme Court has constituted a committee of experts to submit suggestions to facilitate access to justice and timely filing of appeals/petitions by convicts through legal service institutions. The Committee has been asked to submit a report within four weeks "with regard to digitization, translation and electronic transmission of records to facilitate access to justice and timely filing of appeals/SLPs by the convicts, by utilizing the Information and Communication Technology tools". The Committee comprises : Secretary (Ministry of Home Affairs), Government of India, Director General, National Informatics Centre, Member (Process), E-Committee, Supreme Court of India and Member Secretary, NALSA A bench comprising Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran passed the order on January 19. "We have noticed that in the special leave petitions filed by Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC) on behalf of the convicts, there is an inordinate delay which becomes difficult to condone. Needless to say, the situation brings about a lack of even-handedness in dealing with matters of condonation of delay. We see no reason why these delays should continue to occur particularly with the availability of tools provided by information and communication technology which are easily available", the bench observed in the order. The bench had appointed Advocate Vibha Datta Makhija as amicus curiae in the matter. She submitted a report on January 15 in consultation with the SCLSC on measures to curb the delay.  "Valuable as that report is, we consider it appropriate to constitute a Committee comprising of certain experts who would examine all the suggestions and responses which may be received by it from the High Courts as well as the other stakeholders", the bench said. The Committee has been asked to examine the report of the amicus as well as the responses of the High Courts. The bench further observed : "We have also gone through the Module and the Note dated16.10.2019 as per the report for timely filing of appeals/SLPs of convicts though the Legal Services Institutions. We therefore direct the High Courts to submit their responses to the Committee through their Registrars General within two weeks. The Committee shall submit its report within two weeks' thereafter.

The Kerala High Court has ruled that a Magistrate is empowered to decide the pela of talaq raised by the husband in his wife's petition filed under the Domestic Violence Act if he disputes their marital status on that ground.  Justice Kauser Edappagath thereby allowed a criminal revision petition holding that the finding of the appellate court that the Magistrate has no power to decide the validity of the talaq is wrong and only to be set aside. "In a petition filed by the wife under the DV Act, if the husband disputes the marital status on the ground that he has divorced the wife by the pronouncement of talaq, the Magistrate has every power to decide whether the said plea is valid or not. " The petitioners- wife and minor daughter- approached the Judicial Magistrate seeking protection, residential and monetary orders u/s 12(1) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. It is the case of the petitioners that using all the gold and money given by her parents, the first respondent (her husband) constructed a house on his property in which they all resided. Therefore, according to the petitioners, this house is their shared household. In December 2009, her husband and his brothers allegedly assaulted her on two occasions and she was stabbed with a knife in her head. It was after this that she approached the Magistrate with her daughter.  However, the husband argued that he had pronounced triple talaq in December 2009 and that they were divorced since then. He denied all allegations of receiving gold from her parents and domestic violence. He contended that he constructed the house with his own funds and that it is not a shared household.  Finding that the husband failed to prove the pronouncement of talaq, the Magistrate allowed the plea in part, granting the petitioner protection and residential orders, but not the relief of return of gold and money.  This order was challenged by the husband in appeal, and the appeal was allowed on the ground that the Magistrate under the exercise of the power under the provisions of the DV Act cannot decide the validity of talaq. It was further held that prima facie there was material to show that the husband had pronounced talaq, therefore, the status of the petitioner is that of a divorced woman and she is not entitled to claim maintenance. Aggrieved by this, the petitioner moved the High Court with a revision petition.  The Court observed that the talaq allegedly pronounced by the husband was not valid in the eyes of law since he pronounced triple talaq at a go without following any of the procedures mentioned in the decisions of the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the Magistrate could not have been held to be incompetent to decide the validity of the talaq, although the plea was filed under the Domestic Violence Act.  Similarly, there was sufficient evidence to prove that the petitioner was subjected to domestic violence and yet the appellate court proceeded to set aside the order of the Magistrate on flimsy grounds. This finding of the appellant court was found to be perverse and not sustainable.  It was also found that none of the definitions in the DV Act contemplates that on the date of filing an application, the party should be actually residing or living together. The very phrase, 'has lived together at any point of time' necessarily covers even the past cohabitation or past living together.  The Court further held that even the continued residence or occupation of the shared household is not required for the entitlement of a wife to get a residential order.  Therefore, it was held that the petitioners had satisfactorily proved that they were entitled to protection, residence, monetary and compensation orders which were rightly granted by the trial court. Since the appellate court had committed gross illegality in reversing the order of the trial court and dismissing the petition, the Judge found it to be a fit case where the discretionary power vested with this court u/s 397 r/w 401 of CrPC could be exercised. As such, the revision petition was allowed and the judgment of the appellate court was set aside.  Advocates P. Haridas, Renji George Cherian and P.C. Shijin appeared for the petitioners while Advocates B. Mohanlal and Public Prosecutor Sangeetha Raj appeared for the respondents.  Case Title: Shameena Siddique & Anr. v. M. Abubekhar Siddiq & Ors.   
The Supreme Court observed that compensation for future prospects can be claimed in accident cases involving serious injuries resulting in permanent disablement. The bench said that it has come across the opposite view taken by High Courts and Motor Accident Claims Tribunals. Such a narrow reading is illogical because it denies altogether the possibility of the living victim progressing further in life in accident cases – and admits such possibility of future prospects, in case of the victim's death, the court said. The bench observed thus while enhancing compensation awarded to an accident victim who had suffered permanent disability to the extent of 45%. Recalculating the compensation, the bench enhanced the compensation from Rs.9,26,800/- awarded by the High Court to Rs.21,78,600/-. In its judgment, the bench discussed the position of law regarding determining the compensation in accident cases. The principle followed in assessing motor vehicle compensation claims, is to place the victim in as near a position as she or he was in before the accident, with other compensatory directions for loss of amenities and other payments, the court noted. The court made the following observations in the judgment: 'Future Prospects' "It is now a well settled position of law that even in cases of permanent disablement incurred as a result of a motor-accident, the claimant can seek, apart from compensation for future loss of income, amounts for future prospects as well. We have come across many orders of different tribunals and unfortunately affirmed by different High Courts, taking the view that the claimant is not entitled to compensation for future prospects in accident cases involving serious injuries resulting in permanent disablement. That is not a correct position of law. There is no justification to exclude the possibility of compensation for future prospects in accident cases involving serious injuries resulting in permanent disablement. Such a narrow reading is illogical because it denies altogether the possibility of the living victim progressing further in life in accident cases – and admits such possibility of future prospects, in case of the victim's death." 'Just Compensation' "just compensation" should include all elements that would go to place the victim in as near a position as she or he was in, before the occurrence of the accident. Whilst no amount of money or other material compensation can erase the trauma, pain and suffering that a victim undergoes after a serious accident, (or replace the loss of a loved one), monetary compensation is the manner known to law, whereby society assures some measure of restitution to those who survive, and the victims who have to face their lives. Serious injury inflicts deep mental and emotional scars upon the victim Courts should be mindful that a serious injury not only permanently imposes physical limitations and disabilities but too often inflicts deep mental and emotional scars upon the victim. The attendant trauma of the victim's having to live in a world entirely different from the one she or he is born into, as an invalid, and with degrees of dependence on others, robbed of complete personal choice or autonomy, should forever be in the judge's mind, whenever tasked to adjudge compensation claims. Severe limitations inflicted due to such injuries undermine the dignity (which is now recognized as an intrinsic component of the right to life under Article 21) of the individual, thus depriving the person of the essence of the right to a wholesome life which she or he had lived, hitherto. From the world of the able bodied, the victim is thrust into the world of the disabled, itself most discomfiting and unsettling. If courts nit-pick and award niggardly amounts oblivious of these circumstances, there is resultant affront to the injured victim. Case details Sidram vs Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co.

(Para 29-32, 139) Motor Accident Compensation Claims - Notional Income - It is not necessary to adduce any documentary evidence to prove the notional income of the victim and the Court can award the same even in the absence of any documentary evidence - The Court should ensure while choosing the method and fixing the notional income that the same is just in the facts and circumstances of the particular case, neither assessing the compensation too conservatively, nor too liberally - Referred to Kirti and Another v. Oriental Insurance Company Limited, (2021) 2 SCC 166. (Para 59) Motor Accident Compensation Claims - Pecuniary Expenses and Non- Pecuniary Loss - "Future Medical Expenses" and "Attendant Charges" would fall within the ambit of Pecuniary Expenses - "Pain and suffering" would be categorized as a non-pecuniary loss as it is incapable of being arithmetically calculated. Therefore, when compensation is to be awarded for pain and suffering, special circumstances of the claimant have to be taken into account including the victim's age, the unusual deprivation the victim has suffered, the effect thereof on his or her future life.

The Supreme Court, on Wednesday, while exercising power under Article 142 of the Constitution to release A.G. Perarivalan, one of the convicts in Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, restated that Governor has the power under Article 161 to remit/commute/pardon sentences imposed under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, since the executive power of the State extends to the said provision.  A Bench comprising Justices L. Nageshwara Rao, B.R. Gavai and A.S. Bopanna was unable to accept the submission made by the Additional Solicitor General, Mr. K.M. Nataraj that the President has the exclusive power under Article 72 to pardon or grant remission or commute sentences imposed under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code. In this regard it noted -  "The understanding sought to be attributed to the judgment of this Court in Sriharan (supra) with respect to the Union Government having the power to remit / commute sentences imposed under Section 302, IPC is incorrect, as no express executive power has been conferred on the Centre either under the Constitution or law made by the Parliament in relation to Section 302. In the absence of such specific conferment, it is the executive power of the State that extends with respect to Section 302, assuming that the subject-matter of Section 302 is covered by Entry 1 of List III."  ASG had placed reliance on Union of India v. Sriharan (2016) 7 SCC 1, to argue in favour of the exclusivity of the power of the President to remit sentences imposed under the IPC. Senior Advocate, Mr. Gopal Sankaranaryanan, appearing on behalf of Perarivalan had expressed apprehension that if the submission of the ASG is accepted then it would render all the remissions/pardons/commutations granted by Governors in respect of sentences imposed under the IPC, thus far, unconstitutional.   The Court noted that the relevant discussion in the present context is with respect to Article 73 of the Constitution, which deals with the extent of executive power of the Union. In Sriharan, in this regard, the Apex Court had held that 'where the State Legislature is also empowered to make laws on the same subject, determination of whether the executive power of the Union Government would extend to the State Government or not has to be decided by taking into account the fact of whether executive power has been expressly conferred on the Centre, either by the Constitution or under the law made by the Parliament'. In other words, in case of entries in Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, with respect to which both Union and State have power to enact laws, executive power of the Union would extend to such subject matters only when the same is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution or law made by the Parliament. In absence of any such reservation in favour of the Union, executive power of the State remains intact. As the Indian Penal Code or the Constitution does not expressly confer executive power on the Union Government with respect to the provisions of IPC, there is no bar on the State in exercising its executive power with respect to Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently stayed the arrest of a man, who was declared a proclaimed offender by the trial Court, while directing him to surrender before the Court with a stipulation that he shall be released on bail on the same day, subject to furnishing bail bonds and other appropriate additional conditions. The peculiar order was passed in light of the fact that the proclaimed offender had himself approached the Court, in a petition under section 482 of CrPC, challenging the order of proclamation. "The primary object of service is to secure the accused's presence in trial. The petitioner has approached this court on its own, which establishes the bonafide at this stage," Justice Anoop Chitkara said. Thus, without adjudicating the explanation offered and stand taken by the petitioner, the court, in the exercise of its inherent powers, ordered that the arrest of proclaimed offender shall remain stayed till July 30, 2022, by which time he shall surrender before the concerned court, and on appearance, the concerned court shall release him on bail subject to apposite conditions. "However, if the petitioner fails to appear within the time stipulated above, then stay on arrest shall stand vacated without any further reference to this court. It is clarified that if the petitioner appears before the concerned court, then all warrants issued by the concerned court against the petitioner, in the matter mentioned above shall stand recalled and cancelled," it added. In the instant case, the accused was booked for offences under Section 406 (Criminal breach of trust) and 420 (Cheating) IPC, maximum sentence imposable for which does not exceed seven years.. He could not be served through the ordinary process of summons, bailable warrants, and non-bailable warrants so the concerned court finally proceeded against him under section 82 of CrPC and declared him a proclaimed offender. During the hearing, the Court also took note of the directions passed in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273, where Supreme Court directed all the State Governments to instruct its police officers not to arrest the accused automatically when the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years or which may extend to seven years; whether with or without fine.  It also referred to State of Rajasthan v. Balchand, AIR 1977 SC 2447, where the Supreme Court illustrated that the basic rule might perhaps be tersely put as bail, not jail, except where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice. In the present case, the Court opined that the possibility of the accused henceforth not attending the trial, and the likelihood of fleeing justice, can be taken care of by imposing elaborative and stringent conditions. Thus it ordered: "The petitioner shall surrender before the concerned court on or before July 30, 2022. On appearance, the concerned court shall release the petitioner on bail on the same day, subject to furnishing bail bonds to its satisfaction and imposing additional conditions, as it may deem appropriate in the background of the accused's conduct. There shall be a stay of the petitioner's arrest in the case mentioned above until July 30, 2022; however, if the petitioner fails to appear within the time stipulated above, then stay on arrest shall stand vacated without any further reference to this court. On or before July 30, 2022, the petitioner shall procure a smartphone and inform its IMEI number and other details to the SHO/I.O. of the Police station mentioned before. The petitioner shall always keep the phone location/GPS on the "ON" mode. Whenever the Investigating officer asks to share the location, the petitioner shall immediately do so. The petitioner shall neither clear the location history, WhatsApp chats, calls nor format the phone without permission of the concerned SHO/I.O. This condition shall continue till the completion of the trial or closure of case, whatever is earlier. " Case Title: Surjit Singh Dhaliwal Versus State of Punjab and another    
The Karnataka High Court has granted bail to a man accused of possessing Bhang, holding that Bhang is not covered under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS).

The Karnataka High Court has granted bail to a man accused of possessing Bhang, holding that Bhang is not covered under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS).  A single judge bench of Justice K Natarajan allowed the petition filed by accused Roshan Kumar Mishra and granted him bail on execution of a personal bond of Rs 2 lakhs, with two sureties of like amount.  The bench primarily relied on the judgment of the Bombay High Court in the case of Madhukhar vs The state of Maharashtra 2002, SCC Online, Bombay 1271 and the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of Arjun Singh vs the State of Haryana, 2004 SCC Online, P&H 828, wherein the courts had acquitted the accused persons holding that Bhang is not covered under the definition of NDPS Act.  The bench also refused to accept the prosecution arguments that the Bhang is prepared out of the ganja leaves, therefore, it comes under the definition of ganja.  Referring to Section 2 (iii)(a) and (b) of the Act which pertains to charas and ganja or any mixture, with or without any neutral material, of any of the above forms of cannabis or any drink prepared therefrom, the bench said,  "There is no scientific evidence before this Court to show that the Bhang is prepared out of either charas or ganja or ganja leaves. Since ganja leaves and seeds are excluded from the definition of ganja and nowhere in the NDPS Act the Bhang is referred to as a prohibited drink or prohibited drug. Even the State Government has not made any rules under the NDPS and mentioned the Bhang as prohibitory drug or issued any notifications in respect of Bhang."  Following which the bench opined,  "It is worth to mention that the Bhang is a traditional drink, most of the people used to drink in North India especially near the Shiva temples and it is also available in Lassi shops like all other drinks. That apart, the said Bhang were sold in the market with branded names."  Finally it held, "Until the receipt of the forensic science lab report, in order to confirm that this bhang is prepared out of the charas or ganja, the Court cannot come to any conclusion that the bhang is prepared out of the substance of ganja."  Accordingly it allowed the petition and granted bail to the accused.  Case Title: ROSHAN KUMAR MISHRA v.

The Supreme Court has sentenced an Kenyan Citizen of Indian Origin to six months simple imprisonment finding him guilty of contempt of court. Perry Kansangra has deliberately and with a clear intention committed egregious acts of contempt, the bench of CJI UU Lalit and Justice PS Narasimha said. In a judgment delivered in 2020, the Supreme Court, in a child custody matter, held that the father Perry Kansangra was entitled to the custody of the child. A condition was also imposed that he should obtain a "mirror order" from the corresponding Kenyan court within two weeks to take the child to Kenya. Later, the mother Smriti Kansagra filed an application stating that the father got custody by allegedly giving a forged or wrong mirror order from the Kenyan High Court. It was also alleged that he not only refused to obey the directions granting visitation or meeting rights to the mother but also moved the Kenyan court for declaration of invalidity of Indian jurisdiction. Taking note of this, the Supreme Court recalled the order granting custody after finding that he had played fraud on the court and had approached it with "unclean hands" by suppressing material facts. It also initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against him. It was held that Perry is guilty of having committed criminal contempt of Court apart from the contempt for violating express undertakings given to the Courts. On Thursday (3 November 2022), the Apex Court bench considered the issue of sentence. "These acts constitute willful disobedience of the judgment, direction and order of this Court coupled with willful breach of the undertaking given by the Court which constitute civil contempt. The contemnor has falsely represented before the foreign jurisdiction that Indian Courts have not sought the consent of Aditya and that the decision of the Supreme Court of India is unenforceable. These acts clearly lower the authority of this Court. We have also indicated that the contemnor has interfered with the due course of judicial proceedings and obstructed the administration of justice which is a clear case of criminal contempt.", the court said. The bench also noted that the contemnor never showed any remorse or tender any apology for his conduct. The bench therefore directed that Perry be: a) Punished with simple imprisonment for a term of six months for civil contempt of Court for his acts of deliberate and willful disobedience of the orders passed by this Court and to pay a fine of Rs. 12,50,000/- (Twelve Lakhs Fifty Thousand), in default he shall further undergo simple imprisonment for one month.  b) Punished with simple imprisonment for a term of six months for criminal contempt of Court for obstructing the administration of Justice and lowering the authority of this Court and to pay a fine of Rs. 12,50,000/- (Twelve Lakhs Fifty Thousand), in default he shall further undergo simple imprisonment for one month. The court further clarified that these sentences shall be served consecutively and that the total fine of Rs. 25,00,000/- (Twenty-Five Lakhs) to be deposited by the contemnor in the Registry of the Court within four weeks and the same shall be released to Smriti Kansagra upon an application filed by her. Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India has been directed to secure his presence. Government of India including the Ministry of External Affairs and other agencies or instrumentalities shall carry out the directions issued by the Court with due diligence and utmost expediency, it added.

Terming the Standing Order issued by J&K Govt in 2021 for regulation of the stone crushing units in the UT as a valid piece of legislation, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court said that it has in a way liberalized the establishment of stone crusher units. The bench of Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal observed: "The growth of the country and infrastructural development, the stone crusher industry plays a pivotal role and without operating the same, the development of the country will come to a standstill".  The bench was hearing a plea challenging the Standing Order (SO) dated February 23, 2021, issued by the Department of Geology and Mining, Government of Jammu and Kashmir, which according to the petitioners was in violation of the directions issued by the Division Bench in PIL titled Mohammad Maqbool Lone versus State & others. It was also argued that the regulations are contrary to the various provisions of Environmental Laws.  It was also contended that if the SO is allowed to operate, it will defeat the purpose of environmental laws as well as the guidelines which have been framed by the Supreme Court of India and the Division Bench. During the arguments, the court had put a specific query to the counsel for the petitioner as to whether he is seeking reliance on S.O. 60 of 2021 or challenging the the same, since on on one hand he was relying that on S.O. 60 of 2021 and projecting that the respondent No.11 - who is in process of installing a stone crusher in a village of Doda district, had not complied with the stipulation as envisaged in SO 60 and in the same breath he was challenging it.  To this query from the bench, the counsel submitted that he would not press the prayer insofar as challenge to SO 60 of 2021 dated 23.02.2021 is concerned and the statement to this effect was taken on record.  Observing that a person cannot be allowed to have the benefit of an instrument while questioning the same, Justice Nargal said that the counsel appearing on behalf of petitioners, on one hand is challenging the vires of said rules and at the same time, has also placed reliance on same rules and by doing so, is blowing hot and cold in the same breath, which is not permissible under law.  Pointing out to the fact that the policy of the State is not disturbed unless it are found to be grossly arbitrarily or irrational, Justice Nargal observed that the respondents by promulgating the order S.O 60 of 2021 have promoted ease and simplified the things with a view to encourage entrepreneurs to set up these plants and to operate their crusher units by obtaining only two documents/clearances from Deputy Commissioner and the Pollution Control Board. Highlighting the role of stone crushing industry in the growth and development of the country, the court said that any impediments in the process can bring the development to standstill and hence the Government S.O. 60 is a valid piece of legislation and cannot be interfered with.

The Kerala High Court recently held that principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata would squarely apply not just to civil proceedings but to criminal proceedings as well. Justice A. Badharudeen was hearing a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to quash a complaint pending before Magistrate Court, where she was alleged to have committed offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 for dishonour of two cheques worth Rs.15,00,000/- and Rs.11,00,000/-.  The main contention of the petitioner in the case was that the complainant suffers from mental insanity. To emphasise this point, the petitioner drew attention of the court to the medical certificate produced by the complainant in another case where he was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and had applied for bail, pleading the ground of mental instability. The petitioner argued that since a mentally ill person is not capable of entering into a contract, there could be no transaction between the petitioner and complainant. The above contention was vehemently opposed by the counsel for the complainant, who stated that the complainant was diagnosed with bipolar affective mental disorder and was under treatment for episodic psychiatric illness for more than 8 years. However, it was also submitted that the complainant had approached the Kerala High Court for quashing the complaint against him on the ground of mental instability and the same was rejected. The counsel averred that the complainant was now facing trial in the NDPS case as an ordinary person and court records would show the same. The court observed that there was no convincing material to show that the complainant was mentally ill and did not have the capacity to contract. The court accepted the specific contention of the complainant that the petition was barred by res judicata or by constructive res judicata as the complainant had earlier raised the contention regarding mental disorder before the same court for quashing of a complaint against him in an NDPS case. The previous petition was dismissed by the court in an earlier order. Since the earlier petition was dismissed, it is to be assumed that the plea of mental insanity was considered in the negative by the court. In such circumstances, the very same contention is barred by res judicata or constructive res judicata, the court observed. The court relied on the decision of the Apex Court in P.Reghuthaman v. State of Kerala & Ors [Manu/KE/0880/2016] to observed that that principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata would apply to criminal proceedings also. “Therefore, the law is well settled that the principles of res judicata and constructive res judicata would squarely apply in criminal proceedings as well, and it is equally settled that where a person, who is convicted or acquitted, not to be tried for same offence since the said trial is barred under Section 300 of Cr.P.C. Further the same is double jeopardy, which is prohibited”  The court concluded that since the current petition was filed on the ground of the mental insanity of the complainant and since the same ground had already been contended before the court in an earlier petition and had been dismissed, the current petition would fail too as it would be hit by the principle of res judicata.

In a significant observation, the Allahabad High Court has observed that while exercising the revisional power, the Sessions Court cannot quash the cognizance and summoning order passed by the Magistrate as its revisional jurisdiction is very limited. The Bench of Justice Shamim Ahmed further added that in case the Sessions Court finds any illegality, irregularity, or jurisdictional error while acting as a revisional court, then instead of quashing the proceedings, it had power only to issue direction by pointing out the error in the magistrate order. The case in brief An F.I.R. was registered by the revisionist against opposite party no. 2 under Sections 147, 504, 506, 427, 448, 379 I.P.C.. Allegedly, a final report was submitted by the Investigating Officer in a mechanical manner.  Thereafter, the Magistrate, after considering the protest petition and perusing the record of the case, summoned the accused under Section 379 Cr.P.C. in April 2001 expressing his judicial power. This order was challenged before the District and Sessions Judge, Kannauj wherein the Court accepted the final report submitted by the Investigating Officer and had set aside Magistrate's summoning order. Therefore, the revisionist moved to the High Court challenging the order of the District and Sessions Judge, Kannauj. Court's observations  At the outset, in an attempt to explain the recourses available to a Magistrate in a scenario wherein police submits final report in a case findinhg no evidence against the accused to forward him/her for trial, the Court referred to Allahabad High Court's ruling in the case of Pakhando and others Vs. State of U.P. 2001 SCC Online All 967. The Court noted that if upon the investigation, the Police come to the conclusion that there was no sufficient evidence or any reasonable ground of suspicion to justify forwarding of accused to trial and submitting a final report for dropping proceedings, Magistrate shall have the following four courses and may adopt any one of them:  (I) He may agree with the conclusions arrived at by the police, accept the report, and drop the proceedings. But before so doing, he shall give an opportunity of hearing to the complainant; or (II) He may take cognizance under Section 190(I)(b) and issue process straightway to the accused without being bound by the conclusions of the investigating agency, where he is satisfied that upon the facts discovered or unearthed by the police, there is sufficient ground to proceed; or (III) He may order further investigation, if he is satisfied that the investigation was made in a perfunctory manner; or  (IV) He may, without issuing process or dropping the proceedings decide to take cognizance under Section 190(I)(b) upon the original complaint or protest petition treating the same as complaint and proceed to act under Sections 200 and 202 Cr.P.C. and thereafter decide whether complaint should be dismissed or process should be issued. Against this backdrop, the Court upheld the power of the Magistrate to reject the final report and to summon the accused based on the protest petition filed by the informant/complainant. Now, referring to the facts of the case, the Court noted that the Revisional Sessions Court's order was totally based on the plea of alibi of accused-opposite parties, therefore, the Court found that the said order (quashing summoning order of the Magistrate) was not sustainable in the eyes of the law. "On exercising the revisional power, learned Sessions Court cannot quash the cognizance and summoning order passed by the Magistrate, in exercising its revisional power, jurisdiction of Sessions Court is very limited and the Sessions Court can only examine the illegality, irregularity and impropriety of the order passed by the Magistrate. If the Sessions Court find any illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional error then Sessions Court cannot quash the proceedings but the revisional court have only power to issue direction by pointing out the error regarding the order passed by the Magistrate. Therefore, order of learned Sessions Court, is wholly erroneous and against the set principles of law," the Court held. In view of this, the Court allowed the revision plea, and the order dated 26.07.2001 passed by the District and Session Judge, Kannauj was quashed. Case title - Prabhakar Pandey Vs. State Of U.P. And Others [CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 2341 of 2001]   
Amid the cries of a 10-year-old child refusing to be taken away by his biological father, the Bombay High Court asked the maternal grandfather to handover the child’s custody to the father at the police station later in the day. A division bench of Justices AS Gadkari and PD Naik denied to look at video footage of the child screaming for help and then physically fighting off the father while the latter attempted to forcibly take him away from the High Court premises. The court was seized with a contempt petition filed by the father against the maternal grandfather and uncle to handover the child's custody.  Following submissions from all parties involved, the court said, “The fact therefore remains that the Order passed by this Court dated 1st February 2022 and upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court by its Order dated 16th September 2022 has not been complied with…”  While the court noted that several attempts to handover custody in the past had failed, the physical and mental toll of the transition on the child was a pitiable plight to watch in the afternoon, onlookers said.  Later in the evening the child’s physical custody was given to the father amongst heavy police protection at the Kasturba Marg police station in the distant western Mumbai suburb of Borivali.  The Case  After a prolonged illness with tuberculosis in 2016 and then breast cancer the following year, the child’s mother passed away in 2019. She was a professor with some of the oldest colleges in South Mumbai for several years. During her illness she was living with her parents and brother and that’s how even the child began living with them.  Soon after the mother’s demise the grandparents as well as the father approached the Family court for the child’s custody. The family court ruled in the grandparents’ favour. However, on February 1, 2022, the Bombay High Court set aside the family court’s judgement and ordered that the child’s custody be with the father.  The High Court observed that the animosity over the child’s custody between the warring parties may have contributed to the father being alienated from the child. Unfortunately for the child, even the maternal grandmother passed away in 2021. The Supreme Court on September 16, 2022 granted the child’s custody to the father by considering the demise of the grandmother.  Subsequently, the father approached the Bombay High Court in a contempt petition. On December 13, 2022 the bench, to avoid “any complications and creation of scene or ruckus”, directed the senior Police Inspector to take the child’s custody from the grandparents’ building compound.  But the attempt was futile as the child refused to go with the officer, who then apprised the High Court about the same. Finally on Monday, the maternal family agreed to hand over the child’s custody to the father but the child refused again. On Tuesday the court suggested the handover happen in court “to avoid any bickering or scene being created by either of the parties.” However, the court was informed that the child tried to assault the father and ran away from his custody.  The family’s lawyer denied allegations of assault.  “Respondent Nos.1 & 2 (Grandfather and Uncle) are directed to take the child in the precincts of Kasturba Marg Police Station, Mumbai at about 7.00 pm today. We also direct the Senior Inspector of Police, Kasturba Marg Police Station, Mumbai to depute two Police Officers out of which one be lady Police Officer to monitor the handing over of the custody of Master ‘J’ in favour of Petitioner by Respondent Nos.1 & 2 and to assist in avoiding breach of peace or any scene created by either of the parties, if necessary,” the court said in the order.  
Punjab and Haryana High Court recently permitted an Overseas Indian citizen, booked for offences of Cheating and Criminal breach of trust by the Reawri Police, to visit the United States of America for a family reunion.The bench comprising Justice Vikas Bahl held that the petitioner has a fundamental right to travel abroad, which can be regulated by imposing certain conditions on him.... Punjab and Haryana High Court recently permitted an Overseas Indian citizen, booked for offences of Cheating and Criminal breach of trust by the Reawri Police, to visit the United States of America for a family reunion. The bench comprising  Justice Vikas Bahl held that the petitioner has a fundamental right to travel abroad, which can be regulated by imposing certain conditions on him. It observed that the Court is required to "draw a balance" between the right of the petitioner to travel abroad on one hand and the right of the prosecution on another.  "This Court is required to draw a balance between the right of the petitioner to travel abroad and also the right of the prosecution to duly prosecute the petitioner so as to prevent him from evading the trial. From a perusal of the various judgments passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as this Court, it is clear that paramount consideration is given to the conditions imposed upon the persons who have been granted the permission to go abroad, so as to ensure that they do not flee from justice."  The case came up as a result of an order passed by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rewari and Sessions Judge, Rewari, respectively whereby an application to release the passport of the petitioner and grant of permission to visit the United States of America was dismissed. The criminal revision filed against the said order was also dismissed. Therefore, the petitioner approached the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for setting aside both the orders.  The undisputed facts of the case are that the petitioner, one of the directors in the board of directors of a company was facing trial under Sections 420/406/120-B/34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 wherein the passport of the petitioner was confiscated.  The court after hearing both the parties came to the conclusion that the petitioner has a fundamental right to travel abroad because the allegations in the present case are not such as to disentitle the petitioner to travel abroad.   Moving further to another issue that the period for which petitioner had initially sought permission to travel abroad has lapsed the court held that although the period has lapsed the cause still exists.  In the present case, the primary plea raised by the petitioner is to meet his wife and son who are residing in the USA. The said cause was existing at the time of filing of the application at the first stage, at the time of arguments in the revision petition, as well as in the present petition. The cause thus survives. Moreover, the petitioner cannot be deprived of his right to travel abroad and meet his family members, merely on account of the fact that the period for which he had initially sought the said permission, has lapsed. In the present case, the visit was not for a specific function/event, upon the finishing of which, the cause would cease to survive.  Court held that right to travel abroad is very much a fundamental right, but the said right is to be regulated by imposing suitable conditions for securing the petitioner's presence during the trial. It is also open to this Court while exercising its powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to consider any additional/ancillary plea in order to grant permission to the petitioner to travel abroad.  In the present case, the primary ground for opposing the application for permission to go abroad is that the petitioner would not come back to India, in case permission is granted to go abroad. On this aspect, it has been highlighted that the petitioner is a permanent resident of the U.S. since 02.04.2011 and he does not have any immovable property in India. His family also lives in the USA. The company in which the petitioner was on the Board of Directors, is one of the accused in the complaints under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881.  This Court is required to draw a balance between the right of the petitioner to travel abroad and also the right of the prosecution to duly prosecute the petitioner so as to prevent him from evading the trial. From a perusal of the various judgments passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as this Court, it is clear that paramount consideration is given to the conditions imposed upon the persons who have been granted the permission to go abroad, so as to ensure that they do not flee from justice.  Therefore, keeping in view the facts and circumstances the petitioner is allowed to go abroad for a period of one month subject to certain conditions.

The Bombay High Court on Thursday quashed FIR against Dadra and Nagar Haveli Administrator Praful Khoda Patel, Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, Police Superintendent Sharad Darade, and other authorities for allegedly abetting suicide of Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar, seven times Member of Parliament (MP) of Dadra and Nagar Haveli."Considering all these aspects, we find merit in the submissions... The Bombay High Court on Thursday quashed FIR against Dadra and Nagar Haveli Administrator Praful Khoda Patel, Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, Police Superintendent Sharad Darade, and other authorities for allegedly abetting suicide of Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar, seven times Member of Parliament (MP) of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. "Considering all these aspects, we find merit in the submissions of learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners and in our opinion, these are the fit cases so as to exercise the powers of this Court under Section 482 of CrPC to prevent an abuse of process of law", the court stated. Justices Prasanna B. Varale and Shrikant D. Kulkarni allowed a batch of writ petitions filed by the accused persons seeking to quash the FIR registered against them. Delkar was found dead inside a room in Hotel Sea Green South in city's Marine Drive on February 22, 2021.  His son Abhinav Delkar accused the petitioners of abetting the suicide in an FIR under Sections 306 (Abetment to suicide), 506 (criminal intimidation), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence), 120-B (Criminal Conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) read with Section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (Atrocities Act). The FIR alleged that Delkar suffered ill-treatment, harassment and defamation under the orders of Praful Khoda Patel. The two-fold motive behind this was to take control over the college being run by Delkar and to prevent him from contesting next elections. Further, as he belonged to Scheduled Tribe, he was purposely ill-treated in public functions. The petitioners, inter alia, submitted that there is no close proximity of the incidents quoted in the FIR and the act of committing suicide by Delkar. Petitioners further submitted that to attract Section 306 of IPC none of the three pre-requisites - intention, abetment and a positive act of abetment, have been fulfilled. The contents of the FIR also fall short to attract Sections 506, 389 read with Section 120(B) of IPC. Special Public Prosecutor Rafiq Dada submitted that there is a common thread in all the incidents mentioned in the FIR leading to an act of humiliation and harassment of Delkar. As the investigation is in progress this is not a fit case to exercise powers under Section 482 CrPC.  Advocate Ashok Mundargi, Senior Counsel for Abhinav Delkar submitted that though the FIR makes reference to different persons and their individual acts, these acts will have to be treated as a joint and systematic act to ill-treat and harass Delkar constantly so that he is depressed and takes an extreme step.  The court held that it was only the impression carried out by Delkar that he was ill-treated or humiliated. The court observed that there is no material to show that the Administrator or any other petitioner was trying to take control over the college run by Delkar. Further, Delkar contested election as an independent member and was elected.  "In such a situation, if both these alleged objects are not substantially established and it is only in the form of certain allegations and an impression of the deceased, then on such an unacceptable and unsustainable material asking the Petitioners to undergo the rigors of criminal prosecution, is nothing but an abuse of process of law", the court stated. The court further observed that to attract Section 120 (B), there must be positive material to show that the Petitioners came together for hatching a conspiracy and effect was given to that conspiracy. However, in the FIR there are bare allegations without any incident to show that petitioners came together and acted under the orders of the Administrator.  The court relied on Apex Court judgment in Madan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat and held that there must a positive act for satisfying the word abetment. However, the incidents referred to in the FIR are insufficient to show any positive act committed by the Petitioners to satisfy the term abetment which is a pre-requisite of Section 306 of IPC.  The court concluded that the case falls under the guidelines given by the Apex Court in State of Haryana and Others v. Bhajan Lal. The court thus quashed the FIR registered against the nine accused.

The Supreme Court directed Kerala University to appoint a candidate who was illegally denied the post of Lecturer in Department Of Education in the selection process held 14 years ago. The bench of Justices KM Joseph and S. Ravindra Bhat clarified that Bindu TV, the candidate will not be entitled to arrears of salary. Instead she will be entitled to notional fixation and fitment in her grade from the date of such appointment as Assistant Professor with all consequential annual increments etc., and continuity of service on such basis, it said. The matter pertains to a selection process initiated in the year 2003 for the post of Lecturer in the Department of Education in Kerala University. There were two vacancies in the open category to which three candidates including Bindu TV applied. The Rank List was made and Bindu TV was placed at third position. The other two got selected in the year 2007 while Bindu did not get. Aggrieved, she filed a writ petition before the Kerala High Court in the year 2010. The single bench allowed her writ petition and directed the University to appoint her after it found favour with her contention that she was not granted the maximum marks which she would have secured for the articles which she had published in the journal by the name 'Experiments in Education' The Division Bench allowed the writ appeal and set aside the single bench direction. The Division Bench noted that the approved journal is 'Experiments in Function' and not 'Experiments in Education'. "We are of the view that the Division Bench has erred in not finding that the documents would clearly show that the journal 'Experiments in Education' was included as approved after the process was undergone at the hands of the concerned bodies of the University, viz., the Board of Studies, Faculty of Education and finally, the Academic Council.", the bench comprising Justices KM Joseph and S. Ravindra Bhat said. The Court held that Bindu was entitled on the strength of the marks which she has already obtained admittedly and the further marks she would be entitled on the strength of the three articles published in the journal in controversy, to be treated as having attained the first position. The court also clarified that there will be no recovery of any emoluments drawn by the other candidate who had got the appointment and it would not takeaway the benefit of the service.

The Jammu & Kashmir & Ladakh High Court recently ruled that an application filed under the provisions of Order VI Rule 4 of Civil Procedure Code has to be specific in exemplifying the details about allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or wilful default and this provision cannot be enlarged to effect an amendment to the written statement.  A bench comprising Justice Moksha Khajuria Kazmi was hearing a plea wherein the petitioners (original defendants) had challenged the order of the trial court whereby it had rejected the application under Order VI Rule 4 of the petitioners holding that if the application is allowed and the particulars/ pleadings as are mentioned therein are incorporated in the written statement, the same will cause prejudice to the respondent (original Plaintiff) and that allowing the application would mean allowing an amendment of the pleadings of the written statement.  The petitioners in their plea submitted that all controversies would have got settled had the application been allowed as it would have concretized the issues before the court below. Petitioners further contended the application deserved to be allowed even if it would have resulted in amendment of the written statement as the defendant in a suit is entitled to amend the written statement and in doing that the defendant does not suffer the same limitations as the plaintiff.  Deliberating on the matter in question Justice Kazmi observed that the contention of the counsel that the order impugned is bad in law as the right to press into service the provision of law, Order VI Rule 4 of the CPC, cannot be taken away even if it amounted to amendment does not appear to be carrying weight, for, the mandate of the Order VI Rule 4 of the CPC is quite limited. It only provides for stating the particulars in the pleading in all cases where the party pleading relies on any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, willful default, or undue influence, and in all other cases in which particulars may be necessary, the bench underscored.  While discussing the matter the bench also found it worthwhile to record the observations made by Supreme court in Bishundeo v. Seogeni Rai, 1951 SCR 548 wherein it was observed.  "General allegations are insufficient even to amount to an averment of fraud of which any court ought to take notice, however, strong the language in which they are couched may be, and the same applies to undue influence and coercion."  The bench explained that as per Rule 4, particulars with dates and items are clearly required to be stated in the pleading inter alia in cases of misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, willful default or undue influence, for the reason that the opposite party knows the case it has to meet; the issue is not enlarged and the court is enabled to determine the controversy at the earliest.  The bench further noted that Order VI Rule 4 of the CPC has to be specific to the relevant particulars only but the contents of the application filed by the petitioner before the court below do not qualify to mean fraud, coercion or undue influence.  Upholding the trial court order the bench observed application filed by the petitioner before the court below is not in conformity with Order VI Rule 4 of the CPC as it is seeking to elaborate what is already pleaded in the written statement filed by him prior in time. Such elaboration certainly amounts to amending the earlier written statement which could not have been done and the court below has rightly rejected the same as what the law prohibits directly cannot be done indirectly, the bench concluded.

The Delhi High Court has observed that while considering bail, damocles sword cannot be allowed to hang over the accused's head merely on the assumption that the proceeds of crime may be higher. Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar made the observation while granting anticipatory bail to a man in connection with a money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate, related to the alleged fertilizers scam. "Merely on the assumption of the respondent that till date what has been uncovered is may be the tip of the iceberg and the proceeds of the crime may be much higher, damocles sword cannot be allowed to hang over the head of the petitioner when there are no allegations against him of threatening any witness in the investigation and as far as the factual matrix is concerned, those are matter of trial," the Court said. CBI had registered a case on 17th May 2021 under Sections 120B, 420 IPC and Sections 13(1)(d) r/w Sec. 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against Singh and other accused persons. It was alleged that the accused persons entered into a criminal conspiracy from 2007 to 2014 and cheated and defrauded IFFCO and Indian Potash Limited (IPL), its shareholders and the Government of India by allegedly and fraudulently importing fertilizers and other materials for fertilizer production at inflated prices by claiming higher subsidy from Government of India causing loss of several crores of rupees. It was also alleged that they had siphoned off the commission received from the suppliers through a complex web of fake commercial transactions through multiple companies owned by the accused persons, registered outside India in order to camouflage the fraudulent transactions. In August, the Court had granted bail to RJD Rajya Sabha MP Amrendra Dhari Singh in the matter.  It was thus the applicant's case that he has apprehension of his arrest as he is one of the directors of M/s Alankit Limited which had been arrayed as an accused in the case. He also submitted that during the course of investigation, he had joined the investigation more than 20 times and had co-operated in the investigation by providing all the information and documents as per his knowledge.  "The statements of the witnesses U/s 50 of PMLA have already been recorded and there is only an apprehension that the petitioner would tamper with the evidence or threaten the witnesses but till date nothing has been placed on record to show that any such attempt has been made by the petitioner in this regard and there appears to be only an apprehension in this regard," the Court said. The Court also noted that other co-accused were already released on regular bail along with the fact that there was nothing to show that as to for what purpose, the custodial interrogation of the applicant was required. Accordingly, bail was granted by the Court. Case Title: ANKIT AGARWAL v. DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT

The Gujarat High Court has observed that the depletion of the sex ratio in the State of Gujarat is resulting in more and more cases of exchange marriages. It may be noted that it is a form of marriage involving an arranged and reciprocal exchange of spouses between two groups. The Bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Mauna M. Bhatt observed thus while hearing a case while uniting a couple after they were separated by the father of the woman as he wanted to marry her 'in exchange'. The case in brief Essentially, the Court was hearing a petition preferred under Article 226 of the Constitution of India where one Sandipkumar Patel (the husband) approached the Court seeking the custody of the corpus (his wife) from the illegal confinement of the respondent no.4 (wife's father). The father of the woman wanted her to divorce her husband so that he could ensure that the marriage of his daughter can happen in exchange and his son (brother of the corpus) also gets married. When she appeared before the Court, she showed her willingness to join the petitioner. However, the Court noted that she was petrified and was more familiar with the fact that her family was hoping for an exchange marriage as her brother is yet to be married. Her father also confirmed that he is more inclined to ensure that the marriage of his daughter can happen in exchange. Against this backdrop, the Court importantly observed thus: "Depletion of sex ratio in the State of Gujarat has resulted in more and more such cases coming up to the Court where on one hand birth of the daughter is not acceptable and on the other hand with depletion of the ratio, the marriages are essentially the exchange marriages which takes place regardless of will, wish, emotion and the age." Further, noting that in the instant case, the marriage was performed with the will and wish of the corpus and she was not permitted to leave her parental home because of the extreme pressure of the family and her concern for her brother, the Court allowed the petition and directed the corpus to join the petitioner. The Court also acceded to the request of the advocate of the petitioner that the petitioner and the corpus be given the police protection at least for the period of 8 weeks. The Court issued a direction in this regard to the Superintendent of Police, Banaskantha. The Court also issued the following direction: Since the couple is staying at Idar, the Court ordered for initial police protection for an initial period of 5 to 6 days. The Court made a request to the Registrar, City Civil and Sessions Court to ensure that the couple is left in police-van at Idar. The Full-Time Secretary, Idar Taluka Legal Services Authority has been directed to render the best of assistance wherever it is approached by the couple.The Court also conveyed very firmly to the father of the corpus that any attempt to take the law in the hands will be stringently viewed. If anything of that sort is noticed, the police may take appropriate actions, the Court directed. Lastly, the Court disposed of the plea with a hope that the advocates on both sides would ensure that no untoward incident happens as it observed that in the instant case, two adult persons have chosen to marry on their own will and are starting their life together.   
The Karnataka High Court has directed the Managing Director of State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to institute a proper Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to ensure that no contradictory stand is taken by any of the disciplinary authorities and/or the authorities who file written statements in the Motor Accident claim proceedings.  A single judge bench of Justice Suraj Govindaraj said, "if any such event occurs, necessary disciplinary proceedings to be initiated against such persons by following the applicable rules." It added, "Instructions to be also issued that a statement to be made in any written statement filed in a Motor Vehicle Accident claim petition, if any disciplinary proceedings are initiated or not."  The bench made the observations while hearing a petition filed by the corporation challenging an award passed by the Principal District Judge at Tumkur in 2018, by which it directed the corporation to reinstate Ganganna, a driver who was involved in a road accident in 2015.  The judge had allowed the claim petition of the workman and set aside the dismissal order directing the reinstatement of the respondent-workman into service with continuity of service and without back wages from the date of dismissal, but withholding three increments.  During the hearing the bench called for the defence taken by the corporation in the motor vehicle accident Claim Petition, filed under the Motor Vehicles Act.  On going through the same the bench noted that the Road Transport Corporation has certified the driving of the respondent-workman and has categorically stated that the bus was being driven slowly and carefully on the left side of the road and it is further alleged that the rider of the motor vehicle came from the opposite direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the front side of the bus. It was contended that sole responsibility for the accident rested with the rider of the motorcycle, and on that basis, it was contended that the Road Transport Corporation ought not to be made responsible for the compensation which has been sought for in the M.V. case.  However, the bench noted that the Divisional Controller of K.B.S. Division was of the categorical opinion that the bus was being driven in a rash and negligent manner, and the same was informed to KSRTC Managing Director by way of a fax message.  Thus, the bench observed that it remains to be explained by the Managing Director as to how the defence in M.V. Case was taken that the driver was driving in a proper manner and that it is the two wheeler rider who was driving in a rash and negligent manner.  "The Road Transport Corporation, in order to escape its liability in the M.A.C.T. matter, has taken up the contention that the driver was driving in a proper manner and rider of the two wheeler was driving in a rash and negligent manner but on the other hand in the disciplinary proceedings it is contended that its own driver was rash and negligent...It is required for any litigant more so an instrumentality of the state to adhere to one set of facts and not change the set of facts depending on its convenience and/or requirements."  It held that once the driver stood absolved by the said written statement, it is impermissible for the Road Transport Corporation to initiate the disciplinary enquiry.  The Court said that it was for the KSTRC to have come clean and clearly and categorically stated in M.V. case that it was the driver's fault for driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and offered to make payment of the compensation due in the said proceedings. "It is only in order to try and escape the payment of compensation that a false stand has been taken by the Road Transport Corporation, which is established to be false by the contents of the present writ petition as also by the M.A.C.T. in its order dated 08.09.2016 in the aforesaid M.V.Cs."  Further it said, "It is also relevant to take note that not only was the precious time of the M.A.C.T. wasted by taking the said false defence offered by the Road Transport Corporation, but more importantly, the victim of the road accident was denied immediate relief, and succour by way of payment of compensation. The said payment being delayed until the finding being rendered by the M.A.C.T. after evidence being led. These kind of actions on part of the Road Transport Corporation are required to be deprecated and are deprecated."  Accordingly it dismissed the petition.

The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday allowed the termination of pregnancy of a 14-year old girl noting that she was a victim of rape who was carrying an unwanted pregnancy, which is constant cause of trauma and mental torture for her being a girl of tender age. Since the minor girl was carrying a pregnancy of 20 Weeks and 3 Days which was within the period limited... The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday allowed the termination of pregnancy of a 14-year old girl noting that she was a victim of rape who was carrying an unwanted pregnancy, which is constant cause of trauma and mental torture for her being a girl of tender age.  Since the minor girl was carrying a pregnancy of 20 Weeks and 3 Days which was within the period limited by Section 3 of the MTP Act of 1971, and keeping in mind the risk factor of life to the victim, the Chief Medical Officer, Kheri was directed to constitute a Medical Board to examine the feasibility of termination of pregnancy within 24 hours. Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Saroj Yadav thus ordered that the pregnancy could be terminated subject to the condition that Medical Board found no risk to the life and health of the girl. These directions were issued in a writ petition filed through the mother of the minor girl who was subjected to physical violation and sexual abuse and resultantly was carrying an unwanted pregnancy.  "Giving birth to a child by victim of rape that too at such a tender age will make the future life of the victim/petitioner more miserable and it would be improper to make the petitioner/victim suffer from the stigma attached to such pregnancy and birth. The petitioner/victim was subjected to a horrendous and despicable act against her will. If the pregnancy is allowed to continue and the child is born, it would be a continuous reminder of the said horrible incident in the life of the minor petitioner, who has her entire life before her", submitted the petitioner before Court. The Chief Medical Officer, Kheri acting on the directions of the Court issued on the last date of hearing, submitted a report stating the girl was carrying a pregnancy of 20 Weeks and 3 Days live foetus.  It was presumed that the continuance of the unwanted pregnancy shall 'constitute a grave injury to the mental health' of the petitioner/victim, as provided in Explanation 2 of Section 3 of the Act of 1971, as opined by the Apex Court in Z Versus State of Bihar & Others, 2018 (11) SCC 572. Relying on the averments made in the writ petition, wherein it was submitted the father of the victim had died and her mother was not financially sound, the Court went on to direct that all the medical facilities required for getting the pregnancy terminated and for any other treatment thereafter shall be provided at the expenses of the State Government.  "No money will be charged from the victim/petitioner or her family members", the Court said. "The Doctors performing tests/medical procedure for the purpose, will act with utmost sensitivity. As this relates to a crime, so it appears just and necessary that the necessary tissues from the foetus to be preserved", further directed the Court. Accordingly, the Chief Medical Officer has been directed to take necessary tissues from the foetus and preserve the same. "The tissues so preserved shall be kept in a safe custody and be handed over to the Investigating Officer as and when he makes any such request", ordered the Bench. The High Court further directed that the identity of the petitioner shall not be disclosed and she would be referred as Km. 'X' in all the relevant documents.  The prayed made for compensation for the loss and injury caused to the petitioner by the offence under the Victim Compensation Scheme as provided under Section 357-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure was declined with liberty to move an appropriate application before the District Legal Services Authority/Competent Authority. While disposing of the petition, the Court has directed AGA Arunendra to take necessary follow up action in the matter. Cause Title: Kumari 'X' Thru Mother v. State Of U.P. Thru Prin. Secy.

The Orissa High Court has upheld a notification issued by the Government of Odisha, which compulsorily retired a Chief Judicial Magistrate ('CJM') from his service, citing the step to have been taken 'in public interest'.

The Orissa High Court has upheld a notification issued by the Government of Odisha, which compulsorily retired a Chief Judicial Magistrate ('CJM') from his service, citing the step to have been taken 'in public interest'.  While affirming such notification, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice Radha Krishna Pattanaik also held that compulsory retirement is not a punishment; thus, there is no need to give prior hearing to the concerned officer before notifying such retirement.  It observed,  "It is now well settled that compulsory retirement is not a punishment and the necessity of giving a hearing to the Petitioner prior to such decision being taken does not arise. This has been explained in a large number of cases including Baikuntha Nath Das v. Chief District Medical Officer, Baripada, (1992) 2 SCC 299…"  Facts of the Case:  The petitioner was successful in the Odisha Judicial Service (OJS) examination conducted by the Odisha Public Service Commission and was appointed as Munsif (on probation) in OJS-II, Puri and joined in that post on 16th February, 1987. He became a Judicial Magistrate First Class on 14th March, 1989 and served in various locations in the State. He was promoted as Senior Civil Judge in 2005 and posted at Rourkela by an order dated 28th October, 2005.  In terms of the relevant provisions of the Orissa Superior Judicial Service and Orissa Judicial Service Rules, 2007 ('the 2007 Rules'), the petitioner was continued in service after attaining the age of 50 years. By a Notification dated 7th July 2010, he was posted as CJM, Baripada. In 2012, on attaining the age of 55 years, he was allowed to continue as CJM, Baripada. He was then transferred as CJM, Jharsuguda by a Notification dated 18th July, 2013.   Subsequently, at the meeting of the Review Committee held on 6th October 2015, it was decided to recommend to the High Court the petitioner's compulsory retirement in 'public interest'. The Full Court accepted the recommendation at its meeting on 15th October, 2015. The consequential notification compulsory retiring the petitioner was issued by the Government on 5th November, 2015.   Thus, the petitioner approached the High Court and challenged the aforesaid notification which compulsorily retired him.  Contentions of the Petitioner:  Mr. Budhadev Routray, Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, submitted that throughout the career of the petitioner his performance was found satisfactory and that is the reason why he was retained in service on attaining the ages of 50 and 55 years in terms of Rule 44 of the 2007 Rules. Further, he submitted that in terms of Rule 41 of the 2007 Rules, the provisions of the Orissa Civil Services [OCS] (CCA) Rule, 1962 shall mutatis mutandis apply to the members of the OSJS and OJS. It was his contention that as far as the petitioner is aware, there is not a single adverse entry in his CCRs, so as to hold that his continuation in service would be against public interest.   He further argued that if at all the Review Committee was of the view that the continuance of the Petitioner beyond 58 years was against public interest and, therefore, he should be removed from service prematurely then in terms of Rule 41 of the 2007 Rules, he ought to have been given a hearing.  Contentions of the Respondents:  Mr. Pravat Kumar Muduli, Additional Government Advocate appearing for the Opposite Parties, submitted that the service record of the petitioner shows that the recommendation of the Review Committee, which was accepted by the Full Court is justified. While it was correct that the petitioner was retained in service on attaining the ages of 50 and 55, it is not correct that there was no allegation at all against him during that period.   He submitted that although an Inquiry Report was submitted in the Departmental Enquiry, it was never acted upon since it was decided to prematurely retire the petitioner. He clarified that the action taken under Rule 44 is not a punishment unlike disciplinary action taken under [OCS] (CCA) Rule, 1962. The Rule 44 of the 2007 Rules is an independent provision and does not contemplate the giving of an opportunity of hearing. Further, the order of compulsory retirement is not a punishment and, therefore, principles of natural justice were not attracted.  He further pointed out that the impugned decision was taken on over all consideration of not only CCRs of the relevant period under review but the entire record of service, the personal files, overall performance, the yardstick as well as vigilance inputs including the aspect of integrity and suitability before taking the decision in the matter. Public interest was definitely of paramount importance. It was his vehement contention that the mere fact that he was allowed to cross the efficiency bar and granted ACP would not itself lead to the conclusion that his service was satisfactory and that there was no basis for the decision to retire him on his reaching the age of 58.  Court's Observations:  The Court noted that the entire service record of the petitioner was carefully perused by the Court. The CCRs of the petitioner for the years 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2006, 2011 and 2014 reveal that in all these years he got the 'Average' grading and an adverse remark in 1990 was communicated to him as were the adverse remarks for 1992, 1994 and 1995. In some of these years, the Reviewing Authority has remarked that his knowledge of law was 'Average' and that "he needs improvement" and also that he should "improve upon English".   The Court noted that the conduct of departmental proceedings and the submission of the report of enquiry appear to have taken some time. By the time the inquiry report was placed before the Full Court, the petitioner's case for continuation after the age of 58 came up for consideration and the impugned decision was taken.  The Court then explained the procedure involved in taking decisions of compulsory retirements. The decision whether to continue an officer in service after attaining the age of 50, 55 and 58 is taken at two levels: At the first level, there is a Review Committee comprising of Senior Judges of the High Court including the Chief Justice, which carefully peruses the entire service record of the officer. Thereafter, it recommends to the Full Court whether such officer should be retained in service. At the second level, the recommendation of the Review Committee is deliberated in the Full Court and then a final decision is taken in that regard.   The Bench clarified that this is the precise procedure that was followed in the present case. In taking the decision to compulsorily retire the petitioner, the Full Court kept in view the legal principles as explained in S. Ramachandra Raju v. State of Orissa (1994).  The Court further reaffirmed the principle, as has been settled by the Apex Court in number of cases, that compulsory retirement is not a punishment and the necessity of giving a hearing to the petitioner prior to such decision being taken does not arise.   Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.  Case Title: Nilakantha Tripathy v. State of Odisha & Ors.  Case No.: W.P.(C) No. 12369 of 2016   Judgment Dated: 5th August 2022  Coram: Dr. S.

The Supreme Court, on Monday, dismissed a petition which challenged the delimitation exercise carried out for redrawing the Legislative Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir A Bench comprising Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice A.S. Oka passed the order in a plea, inter alia, challenging the delimitation exercise undertaken in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir pursuant to the recent notifications. Justice Oka, reading out the operative portion of the judgment, said that the judgment has clarified that the dismissal of the petition should not be construed as giving imprimatur to the decisions taken in relation to Article 370 as the said issue is pending before a Constitution Bench. Senior Advocate, Mr. Ravi Shankar Jandhyala, representing the petitioners had contended that the delimitation exercise was in violation of the scheme of the Constitution of India, especially Article 170(3), which had frozen delimitation till the first census after 2026. He had argued that the delimitation exercise was being carried out in the teeth of constitutional and statutory provisions. He had further submitted that after the delimitation order was passed in the year 2008, no further delimitation exercise could have been undertaken. The Senior Counsel had emphasised that post 2008, all delimitation related exercise can be carried out only by the Election Commission and not a Delimitation Commission. Justice Oka had highlighted that though the Senior Counsel for the petitioner had orally argued that the provisions of the Jammu And Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 is in the teeth of the Constitution of India, the constitutional validity of the concerned provisions of the statute has not been challenged in the petition. While opening his counter arguments, the Solicitor General of India, Mr Tushar Mehta also submitted at the threshold that the constitutionality of the provisions of the Reorganisation Act have not been challenged in the present writ petition.  The Solicitor General had controverted the petitioner's argument that the provision of the 2019 Reorganisation Act was not consistent with each other or the constitutional framework. It had been argued that the legislature intended the first delimitation to be undertaken by a Delimitation Commission and not the Election Commission, which is busy holding elections throughout the country. Mr. Mehta reverted to the submission of the petitioner that Jammu and Kashmir was singled out for the delimitation exercise, as is evident from the second notification whereby the Central Government had removed delimitation for the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. Mr. Jhandyala had argued that the same was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Mr. Mehta stated that there were internal disturbances in north eastern States and thus they were omitted from the notification.  The Counsel for Election Commission submitted that so far as the increase in number of seats is concerned, ample opportunity was given for raising objections, which was not utililsed and the delimitation order has now attained the force of law.  In his rejoinder, Mr. Jandhyala had pointed out that when a Member of the Parliament had raised a question on the floor of the Lok Sabha asking when will the seats in Andhra Pradesh be increased in terms of the AP Reorganisation Act, the Union Government's response was that till 2026 it could not be altered in view of Article 170(3) of the Constitution. He also emphasised that the J&K High Court as well as the Apex Court in 2011, had upheld the freeze on delimitation in J&K till 2026. It had been also highlighted that, after the delimitation order of 2008, the Election Commission was entrusted with further exercises pertaining to delimitation. He had averred that the Election Commission had abdicated its duties. The petition filed through Advocate on Record Sriram Parakeet asserted that the impugned Delimitation notification, which directed the process of delimitation to be carried out in UT of J&K to be done on the basis of the 2011 population census, is unconstitutional as no population census operation was carried out in 2011 for UT of J&K. The petition also argued that the Delimitation Commission does not have the power to carry out the exercise as under Section 9(1)(b) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1950 and Section 11(1)(b) of the Delimitation Act 2022, the power vested on the Election Commission is to update the Delimitation order by making the necessary changes on account of subsequent events and the said power cannot change boundaries or areas or extent of any constituency by way of any notification. It argued that the Delimitation Commission cannot be established under Section 3 of the Delimitation Act 2002 as it has become inappropriate in 2007 when the Commission was wound up and after which the Delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies Order was issued in 2008. Since the delimitation has been completed and the Delimitation Commission has become inappropriate, the respondents are not competent to carry out the exercise now. The 29th Amendment to the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution in 2002 has frozen the delimitation process in J&K till after 2026. The petition contends that even when Article 170 of the Constitution of India indicates that next delineation exercise is to be carried out only after 2026, enforcing the delimitation process in UT of J&K is not only arbitrary but also violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. The petition also submitted that on 03.08.2021 in reply to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2468 - "The question was in respect of the provision in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, to increase the number of seats in the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Assemblies", the Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs said "As per Article 170(3) of the Constitution, the total number of seats in the Assembly of each State will be readjusted after the first Census is published post the year 2026 ". The plea also challenged the increase in number of seats from 107 to 114 (including 24 seats in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir) in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir to be ultra vires Articles 81, 82, 170, 330 and 332 of the Constitution and Section 63 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. It was emphasised that the change not being proportionate with the respective population was also violative of Section 39 of the UT Act. As per the Guidelines and Methodology for the Delimitation of Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies issued on 2004, the total number of existing seats in the Legislative Assemblies of all States, including UT of NCR and Pondicherry was fixed based on the 1971 census which was to remain unaltered till the first census to be taken after the year 2026. After the abrogation of Article 370, on 06.03.2020, the Union Government, Ministry of Law and Justice in exercise of power under Section 3 of the Delimitation Act, 2002, issued a notification for delimitation of Assembly and Parliamentary constituencies in the UT of J&K and States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. By notification dated 03.03.2021, the 2020 notification was amended - Delimitation Commission was extended for another year and States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland were taken out of the purview of the said notification. On 21.02.2022, by way of another notification the term of the Delimitation Commission was further extended by 2 months, beyond 06.03.2022.

The Allahabad High Court recently imposed Rupees Five Lakhs on an insurance company while noting that it kept the litigation alive for almost 20 years in connection with a Motor Accident Claims case. The Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh imposed the exemplary cost on the Insurance Company as they made the complainant (whose husband died in a motor accident in the year 1999) and her five minor children suffer beyond imagination. The case in brief Essentially, Opposite party no.2/Claimant along with her five minor children filed a Motor Accident claim in 1999 before the Tribunal, Raebareli as her husband died in an accident. The said claim petition was contested by the Insurance Company, however, later on, counsel for the Insurance Company abstained and did not appear in the claim petition. Therefore, the Tribunal vide ex-parte judgment and award dated August 29, 2001, awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.11,94,472/- with 10% simple interest per annum in favor of opposite party no.2/wife of the man who died in an accident. After the award, the Insurance Company filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC along with an application for condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act on December 19, 2001, however, the Tribunal rejected the application for condonation of delay and also dismissed the said application filed under Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act. Further, the Tribunal also directed for initiation of proceedings under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against the Insurance Company as allegedly they had fabricated the documents filed in support of the application. Challenging this very order, the insurance company moved to the HC. Court's observations Perusing the impugned order, the Court did not find that the Tribunal committed any error of jurisdiction or law. Further, the Court termed it as very unfortunate that the victims were not been paid the compensation, which was awarded to them way back in the year 2001.  The Court noted that the HC, on March 26, 2003, had stayed the impugned order without recording any reason whatsoever. Further, the Court also remarked thus: "It is really painful to notice that the victims, whose bread earner had died leaving behind a widow and five children, had to suffer so much because of the pendency of this writ petition before this Court for almost 20 years." In view thereof, the writ petition was dismissed without being any merit and substance. Petitioner-Insurance Company was directed to deposit the entire amount of the compensation along with interest as directed by the Tribunal within a period of one month. Further, the Court also imposed a cost of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs) on the insurance company (to be disbursed in favour of the claimants after due verification) as it had kept the litigation alive for almost 20 years before the HC. "This exemplary cost has been imposed on the Insurance Company as they had made the complainant and her five minor children suffer beyond imagination. If the money awarded was paid on time, the victims could have built up their lives," the Court added as it parted with the order.   
The Kerala High Court recently ruled that the freedom of a pregnant woman to make a choice regarding the continuance of her pregnancy cannot be taken away. It thereby permitted the Petitioner with mild mental and physical disabilities to terminate her 22-week old pregnancy. Justice PB Suresh Kumar allowed such termination despite it having crossed the ceiling of 20-weeks as prescribed... The Kerala High Court recently ruled that the freedom of a pregnant woman to make a choice regarding the continuance of her pregnancy cannot be taken away. It thereby permitted the Petitioner with mild mental and physical disabilities to terminate her 22-week old pregnancy.  Justice PB Suresh Kumar allowed such termination despite it having crossed the ceiling of 20-weeks as prescribed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, after examining a medical report evidencing that the mother has a mild mental disability and impaired adaptive skills, due to which "she might find it difficult to cope with the child-rearing demands of a baby with a disability". Under the Act, termination of pregnancies is permitted only up to 20 weeks and pregnancies beyond that period can be terminated only if it is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. The Single Bench made a significant observation as such: "The freedom of a pregnant woman in making a choice as to whether the pregnancy should be continued cannot be taken away. Likewise, the right of the mother to terminate the pregnancy medically even after the permissible period in terms of the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, has been recognised by the courts, if there is substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped." A couple had approached the Court seeking directions to the respondents to allow the woman to terminate her pregnancy medically. It was alleged that since the outer time limit prescribed in the MTP Act for termination of the pregnancy is over, the respondents were refusing to terminate her pregnancy.  The petitioner urged the medical termination of the 22-week old foetus on the ground that continuance of the same would pose a risk to the mother's life and the baby would suffer from physical and mental abnormalities. When the matter had come up before the Court on a previous occasion, it had directed the Permanent Medical Board of the Kottayam Medical College Hospital to examine the woman and submit a report regarding the potential risk to the woman and the child in terms of mental as well as physical health upon continuing with her pregnancy.  In the report that was accordingly submitted, the Board disclosed that the foetus suffers from Klinefelter syndrome, a chromosomal anomaly associated with variable mental subnormality, endocrine problems, and psychological issues in later life. However, the Board also clarified that it is not a life-threatening disorder.  Nevertheless, in the same report, the Board's neurology opinion revealed that the woman suffers from mild mental retardation, visual disturbances, seizures and weaknesses of the left lower limb with a permanent disability of 55%. Therefore, for the said reasons, the Board had recommended medical termination of pregnancy in the case. Similarly, although the abnormality detected in the foetus might not be life-threatening, the Court found that continuance of the pregnancy could lead to grave injuries to the woman physically and mentally. It was hence held as follows:  "...if the said foetus disorder is analysed in the light of the provision contained in sub-Section(3) of Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, it can be seen that this is a case where it can be held that the continuance of the pregnancy of the petitioner would involve injury to the physical and mental health of the petitioner" The petition was thereby allowed.  Case Title: Karthika Sumesh & Anr. v. State of Kerala & Ors    
The Delhi High Court has granted bail to the Auditor of M/s Shakti Bhog Foods Ltd in the money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against the company. The ED had opposed the bail application, alleging that the company’s Internal Auditor Raman Bhuraria was the mastermind of the whole operation.  Observing that no satisfactory explanation has been given by the ED for the lack of documents that could directly point to Bhuraria as the “mastermind”, Justice Jasmeet Singh said that the only substantial evidence against him are the statements made by the employees of Shakti Bhog under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA), which too have been retracted.  “These statements u/s 50 PMLA do not in my opinion, prima facie establish that the applicant was the mastermind of the whole operation,” the court said.  Justice Singh further said that the ED has recorded the statements made under Section 50 of PMLA, in a “cut copy paste job with even the punctation marks of commas, full stops not differing”.  Noting that the investigation in the case has not been yet completed and, therefore, no charges can be framed nor can the trial begin, the court said, “The period of incarceration as well as the delay in investigation ... justifies a prima facie release on bail. The only substantial evidence which is produced are the statements u/s 50 PMLA which too have been retracted.”  On the basis of a written complaint of State Bank of India (SBI)'s in 2020, the CBI had registered an FIR against Shakti Bhog and its Director/ Promoter, Kewal Krishan Kumar, under Section 120B read with Section 420/ 467/ 468/ 471 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  Accusing Shakti Bhog of financial irregularity, the SBI in its complaint had alleged that it had siphoned of funds in relation to the credit facilities obtained from a consortium of banks led by SBI, causing a loss of Rs. 3269.42 crores. Based on the said FIR, the ED later registered a money laundering case against Shakti Bhog.  Raman Bhuraria, who was the internal auditor of Shakti Bhog for the financial year 2008-09 till 2013-14, and a statutory auditor for the financial year 2006-07, was arrested in 2021 in connection with the money laundering case.   Opposing Bhuraria's bail application, the ED alleged that since he had audited the business and verified false accounting entries in the company's books of accounts, he played an active role in the commission of offence. In support of its allegation that Bhuraria was the mastermind of the whole operation, the ED relied on the emails and statements of the management and employees of Shakti Bhog.  In support of its bail plea, Bhuraria argued that he was not named as an accused or suspect in the FIR lodged by CBI. Further, it was brought to the court’s attention that in the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) filed by the ED, the applicant was not named as an accused.  The court said the reliability of the retracted statements is questionable and cannot form the basis of the guilt of the Bhuraria of the offences as alleged. "Prima facie, I find it difficult to place the guilt of the offence under PMLA on the applicant, based on these statements. Further, the questions as to why the statements were retracted are questions of trial," it said.  The bench further said the Bhuraria has the 15-year association with SBFL, but despite the allegation that he was the mastermind of the whole operation, the ED has relied on five documents to show his complicity. "For the reasons as noted, the documents do not show that the applicant is guilty of offences as alleged against him. In addition, there is not satisfactory explanation given by the ED for the lack of documents that directly point to the applicant as the 'mastermind'," it added.  The Court further remarked that out of a possible 7-year sentence, Bhuraria has already served more than 17 months of pre-trial detention, and to date the trial in the case has not begun.  “The ED has listed 109 witnesses till date and the Prosecution Complaints run into lakhs of pages in multiple trunks. Without a completion of investigation, no charges can be framed nor can trial cannot begin. In the light of this, the court cannot let the applicant undergo long period of detention. If this court allows the continuing pre-trial incarceration, the same will amount to deprivation of personal liberty as well as travesty of justice as the same is equivalent to punishment without trial,” the bench said.  The court said even though the allegations are serious, the chargesheet is yet to be filed.  "Assuming that the applicant was the mastermind, the respondent did not name him in the original FIR. The applicant had conducted audit of the company and had certified the fictitious accounting entries in the books of accounts of the company to inflate financials of SBFL, even then during his entire custody he has been interrogated only on one occasion on 13.11.2021,” it said.  Observing that the CBI may proceed with the investigation but not at the cost of continued incarceration of Bhuraria, the court said: “Having regard to the totality of the circumstances, in my opinion, the applicant should be released on bail.  The Court thus allowed the bail application and granted bail.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a person who has already been granted regular bail under Section 439 of CrPC and if it found that he has not misused the liberty, then he may be granted anticipatory bail under Section 438 of CrPC in connection with added sections related to the same crime. With this, the bench of Justice Krishan Pahal granted anticipatory bail to one Shahzad in connection with the offence under Section 3/7 of The Essential Commodities Act. Essentially, he was earlier granted bail by the Sessions Judge, Saharanpur in February 2022 under Sections 379, 427 IPC, Sections 15, 16 of The Petroleum and Minerals Pipeline (Acquisition of Users in Land) Act, Section 3/4 of the Exclusive Substances Act and 3/4 of The Prevention of Damages to Public Property Act.  In that very matter, after the investigation, a final report was submitted in the added Sections 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act. Therefore, seeking anticipatory bail in those sections as well, he moved to the High Court. His Counsel argued that the abovementioned sections were added just to frustrate the case of the applicant, so that he may be sent behind the bars. It was also argued that once the applicant had been admitted to regular bail, there was nothing on record to suggest that he had misused it or he had committed any other offence. In this regard, the Apex Court's judgments in the case of Bhadresh Bipinbhai Sheth vs. State of Gujarat & Another 2016 (1) SCC (Cri) 240 and Manoj Suresh Jadhav & Ors. vs. The State of Maharashtra, 2018 SCC OnLine SC 3428 were also referred to, wherein the applicants therein were enlarged on anticipatory bail in the added sections after being enlarged on regular bail Taking into account the case and arguments advanced, the Court noted that it was true that the applicant was enlarged on bail in the said F.I.R. and he has not misused it during the investigation and no apprehension of tampering with evidence had been raised by the A.G.A, therefore, the Court opined that sending him behind bars again in the added sections would be of no fruitful use. Consequently, the applicant was found to be entitled to be enlarged on anticipatory bail, and thus, the anticipatory bail application was allowed and it was ordered that the applicant be released forthwith in the crime on anticipatory bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.

The Delhi High Court recently denied bail to a woman in a case concerning the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Act, after observing that there is a greater presumption being an educated person that carrying large quantities of narcotics is a crime.Justice Subramonium Prasad said:"An uneducated person may claim no knowledge of the substance found in his/her possession and may raise a defense... The Delhi High Court recently denied bail to a woman in a case concerning the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Act, after observing that there is a greater presumption being an educated person that carrying large quantities of narcotics is a crime. Justice Subramonium Prasad said: "An uneducated person may claim no knowledge of the substance found in his/her possession and may raise a defense of the substance being planted on them but being a highly educated person, there is greater presumption that carrying large quantities of narcotics is a crime and that it would entail consequences in law which could be harsh and irrevocable." The Court refused to grant bail to one Sonia Shamrao Naik after opening that the quantity recovered from her was commercial quantity therefore the case could not fall within the twin parameters of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. The woman was found to be in the possession of Methamphetamine, sample of which was verified by conducting a chemical test of the sample of the seized material. "The disclosure statement has lead to the arrest of two Nigerian accused in whose possession narcotics was found. It has also been discovered by the NCB that these two accused were living illegally in India on fake passports. Material on record discloses that the petitioner is a part of a network which deals in supply/sale of Narcotics," the Court said. "The clean & tidy track record of the Petitioner does not absolve her from being in possession of 600 Gms of Methamphetamine," it added. The petitioner's bail plea was rejected by Special NDPS Judge, Patiala House Court in 2019 on the ground that she was caught with narcotics, in commercial quantity, at a Nizamuddin Railway Station. The Court observed that the there was a prima facie case against her for the offences she was charged with and it appeared that she had been trafficking commercial quantity of narcotics. "There appears to be a prima facie evidence that the Petitioner was in the possession of 600Gms of Methamphetamine at Nizamuddin Railway Station on 22.2.2018," the Court said. Accordingly, the bail plea was dismissed.

The Supreme Court observed that sealed cover procedure sets a 'dangerous precedent' as it makes 'the process of adjudication vague and opaque'.  The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli , in a judgment delivered on 20 October 2022, observed that this procedure affects the functioning of the justice delivery system and causes a serious violation of natural justice. The measure of nondisclosure of sensitive information in exceptional circumstances must be proportionate to the purpose that the non-disclosure seeks to serve, the bench observed, adding that the exceptions should not become the norm. The court made these observations while allowing the appeals against the order of Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) that had dismissed the applications challenging the denial of Permanent Commission (PC) in the Indian Navy holding that there was no gender bias or mala fides in the grant of PC. The main issue that arose in this appeal was whether the AFT could have adjudicated on the validity of the selection proceedings when relevant material (board proceedings) was disclosed only to the AFT in a sealed cover. In this regard, the appellants contended that the sealed cover procedure, which was followed by the AFT, has resulted in substantial prejudice. On the other hand, the respondents submitted that it is a norm for the Board proceedings to only be provided to the AFT in a sealed cover. The court, referring to some earlier decisions, made the following observations on Sealed Cover Procedure: Causes a serious violation of natural justice The elementary principle of law is that all material which is relied upon by either party in the course of a judicial proceeding must be disclosed. Even if the adjudicating authority does not rely on the material while arriving at a finding, information that is relevant to the dispute, which would with 'reasonable probability' influence the decision of the authority must be disclosed. A one-sided submission of material which forms the subject matter of adjudication to the exclusion of the other party causes a serious violation of natural justice. In the present case, this has resulted in grave prejudice to officers whose careers are directly affected as a consequence. makes the process of adjudication vague and opaque ; sets a dangerous precedent. The non-disclosure of relevant material to the affected party and its disclosure in a sealed-cover to the adjudicating authority (in this case the AFT) sets a dangerous precedent. The disclosure of relevant material to the adjudicating authority in a sealed cover makes the process of adjudication vague and opaque. Two problems with sealed cover procedure Firstly, it denies the aggrieved party their legal right to effectively challenge an order since the adjudication of issues has proceeded on the basis of unshared material provided in a sealed cover. The adjudicating authority while 24 relying on material furnished in the sealed cover arrives at a finding which is then effectively placed beyond the reach of challenge. Secondly, it perpetuates a culture of opaqueness and secrecy. It bestows absolute power in the hands of the adjudicating authority. It also tilts the balance of power in a litigation in favour of a dominant party which has control over information. Most often than not this is the state. A judicial order accompanied by reasons is the hallmark of the justice system. It espouses the rule of law. However, the sealed cover practice places the process by which the decision is arrived beyond scrutiny. The sealed cover procedure affects the functioning of the justice delivery system both at an individual case- to case level and at an institutional level. Exceptions should not become the norm However, this is not to say that all information must be disclosed in the public. Illustratively, sensitive information affecting the privacy of individuals such as the identity of a sexual harassment victim cannot be disclosed. The measure of nondisclosure of sensitive information in exceptional circumstances must be proportionate to the purpose that the non-disclosure seeks to serve. The exceptions should not, however, become the norm  The court observed that, in this case, the failure to disclose relevant material has caused substantial prejudice to the appellants and that this case exposes the danger of following a sealed cover procedure. The court thus directed the AFT to reconsider the entire matter afresh.

In a significant judgment, the single bench of Rajasthan High Court held that the married daughter of a deceased employee falls within the definition of 'dependents' for compassionate appointment.

In a significant judgment, the single bench of Rajasthan High Court held that the married daughter of a deceased employee falls within the definition of 'dependents' for compassionate appointment.   "The perception of the daughter, after marriage no longer being a part of her father's household and becoming an exclusive part of her husband's household, is an outdated view and mindset."Justice Dr. Pushpendra Singh Bhati, observed.  The court observed that any discrimination between unmarried & married daughter and married son & married daughter would be in clear violation of Article 14 ,15 and 16 of the Constitution.  The court observed that in RBF Rig Corpn. v. Commr. of Customs (Imports) (2011) 3 SCC 573, State of A.P. v. Golconda Linga Swamy (2004) 6 SCC 522 and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India), it was held that in an appropriate case the writ court retains the power as inherent in its constitution to do the right and undo a wrong in course of administration of justice on the principle of quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur id sine quo res ipsa esse non potest i.e. when the law gives a person anything, it gives him that without which it cannot exist.  In the present matter, the father of the petitioner, who was working as Lineman in the Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited, died while in service on 05.11.2016 leaving behind his wife Smt. Shanti Devi and daughter-petitioner. Deceased's wife was having health issues and thus, the petitioner, who is his married daughter, applied for compassionate appointment, which was initially processed, but subsequently rejected.  In this regard, the concerned authority held that as per Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited Compassionate Appointment of Dependents of Deceased Nigam Servants Regulation, 2016 (hereinafter to referred as 'Rules of 2016'), a married daughter of deceased employee would not fall within the category of the 'dependents'. The petitioner has challenges the aforesaid decision of the authority in this petition.  The court finds that the right to be included in the coparcenary of father and the equal responsibility of maintenance of parents in old age as that of a son, regardless of marital status; places equal responsibilities on married daughter and married son. The court opined that no reason as to why a distinction must be made on the same ground, when it comes to compassionate appointment of married daughters.  The court also observed that the pre-marriage status of a daughter, of being single/unmarried and post marriage status of a daughter either divorced, widowed or single again, renders her capable of seeking compassionate appointment. Only the exclusion of a daughter, during the period of marriage, for seeking compassionate appointment is arbitrary and unjust, added the court.  Furthermore, the court opined that discrimination between a married son and a married daughter, with regard to appointment on the ground of compassionate appointment is not a reasonable classification and amounts to a treatment of equal persons in the eyes of law as unequal, which grossly violates Article 14. It adds that the aforesaid discrimination is not only violative of Article 15(3), but goes against the interest of women. In furtherance, court observes Article 16 prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex among citizens, particularly in the matters of public employment.  Moreover, the court finds that the Apex Court in C.N. Apporva Shree, while analyzing the judgment has gave full imprimatur to the reasoning of the Karnataka High Court in Smt. Bhuvaneshwari V. Puranik and thus, it is clear that the rule within expression of family/dependent has to include unmarried daughter at par with married daughter and married daughter at par with married son.  The court opined that the larger ramification of a law being struck down by the Courts is that it stands nullified in its stream of parallel legislation. It adds that even if any analogous law or legislation having the same meaning is not directly mentioned, then also, if it is absolutely on the same terms, as that of the law having been struck down by the Apex Court, then such legislation will fall within the same purview.  The court further observed that it is not necessary that all legal parameters on the same wavelength need to be mentioned while striking down a legislation. The court further adds that what is to be seen is that the words and the exact spirit, if same, the verdict of the Apex Court is bound to have an impact of completely governing the field in question.  In addition to this, the court observed that an analogous rule existed in the Rules of 1996 before the amendment made by the Legislature of the State of Rajasthan on 28 Oct, 2021. The court adds that it finds that there is no requirement to strike down the said provision of law, however, it also does not find any reason to deprive the petitioner of her right, especially in light of C.N. Apporva Shree and the subsequent amendment brought by the State Legislature.  In furtherance, the court observed that the welfare legislation, in the considered opinion of the State has, after recent amendment to the Rules of 1996, now includes "married daughter" in the definition of dependent in the Rules of 1996, and to give a full colour to the welfare legislation, it needs to be implemented on all pending issues, which have not attained finality. It further observed that this matter of.present case comes within the perspective of pending issue and has been sub-judice since 2017.  Taking into account that the Rules of 1996 are a welfare legislation, and the resounding mandate of Apex Court declaring the law treating a married daughter, as a disqualified person, as a trite law, the court is not declined to accept the proposition of the learned counsel for the respondent seeking rejection of the claim of compassionate appointment of the petitioner.  The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is entitled to be given the compassionate appointment., as per Clause (iv) of Rule 2(c) and as per the clear interpretation of the Rules of 1996, which states that 'dependant' includes married daughter, if no other dependent of the deceased Government servant is available.  On the other hand, the counsel for the respondents relied upon the order of this Court in the case of Nakul Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors. in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.15912/2021, decided on 26.11.2021 wherein the court held that if the rule making authority at the relevant time provided within the purview of the definition of dependent a smaller class of members of the family of the deceased Government servant and excluded his/her brothers or sisters, the same per se so cannot be said to be discriminatory.  Adv. Trilok Joshi appeared on behalf of petitioner, whereas AAG Pankaj Sharma, Adv. Kuldeep Mathur assisted with Adv. DS Sodha appeared on behalf of respondents. Case Title: Shobha Devi v. Jodhpur Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited and Anr.    
The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted relief to certain candidates who participated in the process of recruitment of 69000 Assistant Teachers in Primary Schools but their candidature was canceled by UP Goverment due to discrepancies/errors mentioned in the application form relating to "Shiksha Mitra". The bench of Justice Om Prakash Shukla observed that in case a candidate furnishes some information in his/her online application form by way of which, he/she put himself in a disadvantaged position, his candidature will not stand cancelled. In this regard, the court took note of the two Judgments of the Apex Court in the cases of Jyoti Yadav & Anr. V/s The State of UP & Ors. [WP 322 of 2021] and Rahul Kumar vs. State of UP and others [WP 378 of 2021] wherein it was ruled that in case a candidate furnishes some information in his/her online application form which, although not in commensurate to the actual information, but does not put him/her to any advantageous position, such misinformation, in seclusion, may not be treated as a ground for rejecting the candidature. With this, the Court, while granting relief to over 100 candidates, issued the following orders/direction to the authorties: (i) The issue relating to Shiksha Mitra be reexamined by the competent authority in the light of the observations made by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgments;  (ii) All impugned orders rejecting the candidature of the candidates on account of the error committed by them relating to Shiksha Mitra are set-aside;  (iii) It is made clear that candidates, whose names do not find place in the select list dated 12.5.2020, will not get any benefit with the change of marks as their merit position will not be changed for the reason that in case this is allowed to happen at this stage, it will open the entire selection process which is not the spirit of the order passed by this Court;  (iv) These cases are remitted to the authority of the district concerned for re-examination thereof considering the aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court and to take a final decision thereon.  (v) The entire process shall be completed by the competent authority within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, considering the respective writ petition as representation of the candidate concerned;  (vi) It is further directed that in case any candidate is found entitled for appointment and is offered appointment on review of his/her case in terms of the aforesaid directions, he/she shall get all the benefits from the date, he/she joins the service.  (vii) Any recovery proceedings, initiated, by the concerned authority shall be kept in abeyance and shall be subject to the decision/outcome of competent authority of the district concerned. The case in brief The Court was essentially dealing with a bunch of pleas filed by candidates/petitioners, whose candidature for the post of UP Assistant Teachers in primary school in the year 2019 were either not found proper due to inaccuracy and/or discrepancy between the online application and the actual status of the said candidate. Though some of these petitioners found their way to the final selection list, however subsequently, the department, finding disparity in the declaration made in the online application and the actual status of the said candidate, cancelled their recruitment and consequent recovery were directed by the respondent. Essentially, the discrepancies/error mentioned in the application form was related to "Shiksha Mitra", wherein in some petitions, the weightage marks for working as shikha Mitra had not been given appropriately, whereas in some cases the petitioners have been erroneously considered as Shiksha Mitra and were although initially given appointment, however, subsequently their appointment were cancelled and consequential recovery orders were issued against them.  These discrepancies/error crept either due to non-mentioning or clicking the wrong key/code, leading to erroneous weightage given for working as Shiksha Mitra or erroneously opting for BTC through regular channel or BTC through correspondence. Taking into account the fact that the issue relating to any kind of rectification of error in the application form by any candidate of Assistant Teacher Recruitment Examination, 2019, stood settled by the two judgments of the Apex Court, the Court directed the competent authorities to examine the case of the petitioner in terms of the observations of the Apex Court.  Therefore, issuing the directions as aforesaid, the Court disposed of the petitions. Advocates Abhishek Khare, Aahuti Agarwal, Virendra Kumar Dubey, Deepak Singh, P.K.

In a case filed by Amul for removal of the "defamatory content" targeting it on social media and video-sharing site Youtube, Google LLC has told the Delhi High Court that it cannot disclose the Basic Subscriber Information (BSI) of a Youtube user whose details are stored with Google Ireland.  With Google Ireland also refusing to disclose the information without following "of a legal process through Irish Courts or by way of a Letters Rogatory through the Government", the high court has sought a response from the union government on the issue. Justice Prathiba M. Singh in the order dated November 21 asked a counsel representing the Centre to obtain instructions regarding existence of any 'Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty' between India and Ireland, and also regarding any recent developments on data protection laws in India. In its suit seeking deletion of the online defamatory content, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited - the owner of the Amul brand, in April filed an application seeking impleadment of a Facebook user and Google LLC. The application alleged that the original video has been re-shared on Facebook and Youtube.  While Facebook agreed to share the BSI relating to the Facebook profile of one Pratul Hora, Google LLC told the court that details of the uploader 'WIDEOPEN' are available with Google Ireland. The court in its May 13 order directed Google Ireland to submit a response and also clarify regarding its exact legal status whether it is a subsidiary of Google LLC.  On November 21, Google LLC told the court that access to the Youtube video has been blocked in India but since the person uploading the video was not based in India, the BSI details are not available with it.  "Hence, Google LLC is unable to disclose the required BSI details of M/s. WIDEOPEN as the same are stored with and are under the control of Google Ireland, which is subject to the laws of Ireland, as also, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)," the court recorded in the order. Senior Advocate Arvind Nigam, representing Google Ireland, argued that it is bound by Article 48 of GDPR which states that any court or administrative order of a third country for access to personal data "may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other grounds for transfer pursuant to this Chapter." Nigam also referred to the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, 1856 (Ireland) and Order 39 Rule V of the Superior Court Rules (Ireland).  "A conjoint reading of Article 48 of GDPR, the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, 1856, and the Superior Court Rules (Ireland), shows that the only manner in which the BSI details of M/s. WIDEOPEN can be obtained currently, pursuant to the orders of an Indian Court, would be either by means of a legal process through Irish Courts or by way of a Letters Rogatory through the Government," the senior counsel submitted, adding that in the absence of a 'Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty' between India and Ireland, there is no other procedure to obtain the said data. However, the counsel representing Amul referred to Neetu Singh & Anr. v. Telegram FZ LLC & Ors to argue that since the video is admittedly controlled and managed by Google LLC, the relevant data ought to be disclosed by Google LLC.  The court will consider the Centre's response on February 09, which is the next date of hearing in the matter. Title: GUJARAT COOPERATIVE MILK MARKETING FEDERATION LTD & ANR. vs SUJAY KUMAR & ORS  
"In the context of consensual or voluntary sexual intercourse, and more so if the girl is underage while the boy would be above the age of 18 and also if it is confirmed that they are living as husband and wife and the wife perhaps having given birth to a child, the issue becomes more complex" : Meghalaya High CourtThe Meghalaya High Court recently quashed FIR and criminal proceedings in a POCSO case registered against a man as it noted that the accused man and victim-wife were living with each other as husband and wife and out of the said union, a child was born.The Bench of Justice W.

The Meghalaya High Court recently quashed FIR and criminal proceedings in a POCSO case registered against a man as it noted that the accused man and victim-wife were living with each other as husband and wife and out of the said union, a child was born. The Bench of Justice W. Diengdoh however stressed that such cases of consensual or voluntary sexual intercourse with an underage girl by an adult man while they are living as husband and where the wife gives birth to a child, are complex. The case in brief Essentially, petitioner No. 1 (Husband/Accused) and petitioner No. 2 (Wife/victim) are husband and wife and in course of their relationship, petitioner No. 2 got pregnant, and accordingly, when the petitioner No. 1 took her to a hospital for medical checkup, the hospital authorities on confirming that petitioner No. 2 is pregnant and that her age was about 17 years, they informed the police of the matter. The police suo moto booked petitioner No. 1 (Husband/Accused) u/s 5(j)(ii)/6 POCSO Act and thus, he moved to the HC with a Section 482 CrPC seeking to quash the FIR against him and subsequent criminal proceedings.  Before the Court, his counsel submitted that petitioner No. 1 and petitioner No. 2 are husband and wife and a statement to this effect was made by the minor wife u/s 161 CrPC as well as u/s 164 CrPC The Court was also told that the mother of the minor girl, in her statement also recorded u/s 161 as well as u/s 164 CrPC had confirmed the said fact and had also said that out of the cohabitation between the couple, a male child was born to them. Neither petitioner No. 2 nor the family members wished to proceed with the case against petitioner No. 1. Lastly, it was told to the Court that the petitioners hail from a rural background and who are oblivious to the provisions of law, particularly the POCSO Act and they had willingly cohabited together as husband and wife as per the customary law of the land and it was, but natural, that a child would be conceived out of such union Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the minor-wife at the relevant period was below the age of 18 years and therefore, she would fall with the definition of a 'child' as per Section 2(1)(d) of the POCSO Act.  Further, the Court noted that being a child and not capable of giving consent, the act of sexual contact made by the Husband-Accused was contemplated to be punished as aggravated penetrative sexual assault, however, the Court further opined that the act committed under the circumstances of the instant case cannot be called or termed in any logical or rational sense as a case of assault as there was no threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact or bodily harm on the petitioner No. 2 has been made out.  In view of this, the Court decided to quash the FIR in the case and the consequent criminal proceedings by invoking its extra-ordinary power under section 482 Cr.P.C. with a view to secure the ends of justice.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently directed the trial court to issue direction against the Prosecutrix in a rape case to refund the compensation she had received from the State Government because she had admitted in her statement that she had lodged a false report against the accused.  Deciding the bail application moved by the Applicant/accused, Justice Vivek Agarwal observed-  Trial court will consider issuance of a direction against the prosecutrix to refund the amount received by her because she admitted in her examination in chief that she has lodged false report on account of some oral dispute between the parties. Therefore, alleged false report is lodged, therefore she is not entitled to keep the amount of compensation paid by the State government collected from the tax payer of the country. Thus, trial court will consider to direct the prosecutrix to refund that amount in the appropriate head of the treasury account.  The facts of the case were that the Applicant was accused for offences punishable under Section 376, 376(2)(N), 506 IPC, U/S 3, 4, 5J(ii), 5L POCSO Act and under Section 3(1)(w)(II), 3(1)(w)(II), 3(II)(V) of SC/ST Act.  The Applicant submitted before the Court that the Prosecutrix had turned hostile before the trial court and was not supporting the prosecution story. He further pointed out that even her grandmother and her uncle had turned hostile. He asserted that there was no chance of Prosecutrix being influenced and that all the other material witnesses had been examined. He prayed that since his trial would take time to conclude, he be enlarged on bail.  Considering the facts of the case and documents on record the Court, the Court thought it to be a fit case for grant of bail-  Taking into consideration submissions of learned counsel for the parties and the fact that prosecutrix is already examined, she has not supported the prosecution story and applicant is in custody since 03/11/2021. Hence without commenting anything on merits of the case, this bail application is allowed.  With the aforesaid observations, the Court allowed the application and accordingly, the Applicant was granted bail. Case Title: BABLESH PATEL v. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH    
While denying bail application of an ex-MLA in the UP Legislative Assembly who has been convicted by a lower court for assaulting a person in the lockup, Allahabad High Court recently observed that "nowadays, the legislatures and political persons are thinking themselves as above the law. This menace cannot be lightly taken and should be dealt with iron hand."The Bench of Justice Mohd. Aslam... While denying bail application of an ex-MLA in the UP Legislative Assembly who has been convicted by a lower court for assaulting a person in the lockup, Allahabad High Court recently observed that "nowadays, the legislatures and political persons are thinking themselves as above the law. This menace cannot be lightly taken and should be dealt with iron hand." The Bench of Justice Mohd. Aslam was hearing the plea filed by Hasratulla Shervani (ex-MLA) seeking suspension of sentence and his release on bail during the pendency of an appeal against lower court's conviction order [convicting him under various sections of IPC including 'Attempt To Murder'] Here, it may be noted that while the Court rejected the bail plea of the ex-MLA, the Court allowed the bail plea of others (in total 8 persons) who are involved in the instant case and had moved their bail plea along with the plea of the prime accused (ex-MLA). The facts in brief As per the prosecution, an FIR was lodged in September 2012 in Kasganj district of UP by one Shamsad (informant) alleging that in May 2011, a false report was lodged against him on account of which police has arrested the informant and lodged in the lock-up.  Thereafter, in August 2021, while he was in the lockup, the accused-appellant Hasratulla Shervani (the then MLA) along with other persons including his relatives and supporters came to the police station and instructed the police to beat him so badly so that he will become crippled by foot and hand, otherwise they will ready for the bad consequences.  After that, the accused-appellant Hasratulla Shervani (armed with riffle and gun) along with his supporters (armed with danda) proceeded towards the police lock-up and caught hold his hand in the lock-up from outside and assaulted upon him with an intention to kill him by the butt of the rifle and other guns, lathi and danda.  However, since the S.O. Ram Murti Yadav intervened, he could be saved. Submisisons made before the Court It was contended by the counsel for accused-appellants that in this case, the informant/injured had turned hostile and other eyewitnesses have also turned hostile and only two police personnel Rtd. S.I. Phool Singh and H.Ct. Chhote Lal ha supported the prosecution.  It is further contended that the injuries found on the body of the informant were of simple nature. On the other hand, opposing his bail plea, the State counsel argued that Hasratulla Shervani was elected member of the Legislative Assembly and he had crossed all the limits and has beaten the informant at the lockup of the police station by calling him near and, pulling his hand outside lock-up and has also obstructed the police in performing their official duties. Court's observations At the outset, the Court perused the injury report and found that it prima facie supported the contents of the first information report, therefore, the Court opined, in the above circumstances and that the injured had turned hostile is of no consequence.  The Court also noted that it appeared that on the influence of accused-appellant Hasratulla Shervani, the witnesses have turned hostile.  Significantly, noting that the accused MLA has the duty to raise the issue of misuse of law in Assembly and get it remedied but instead of it, he himself misused the law and took law in his hand, the Court, while rejecting his bail plea, remarked thus: "...(he) pressurized the police personnel to adopt third degree and get him lodged in police lock up, this act of the accused amounts to misuse of police machinery, therefore, his act deserves no sympathy instead of condemnation." However, the Court allowed the bail application of other accused-appellants noting that they had followed him and the sentence awarded to them will remain suspended during the pendency of the appeal. The Court has also listed their appeal against the lower court's judgment for a final hearing on January 10, 2022. Case title - Hasratulla Shervani And 8 Others v. State of U.P  Read Order   
The Gujarat High Court has reiterated the position of law that once the employees have accepted the benefits under Voluntary Retirement Scheme, it is not open for the employees to challenge the scheme.They can also not contend after having withdrawn the amount, that they should be permitted to continue with their employment services, it added. Reiterating this principle, Justice... The Gujarat High Court has reiterated the position of law that once the employees have accepted the benefits under Voluntary Retirement Scheme, it is not open for the employees to challenge the scheme. They can also not contend after having withdrawn the amount, that they should be permitted to continue with their employment services, it added.  Reiterating this principle, Justice Biren Vaishnav declined to interfere with the award of the Labour Court wherein the Court had found that the employees had withdrawn their applications for VRS after their applications were accepted by the employer and the amounts were paid to them.  Background The VRS came in the background of the disinvestment by the Central Government in the Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited. Reliance Industries Limited became a major stakeholder of the Company. Consequently, two schemes were launched – the Voluntary Separation Scheme and the Special Separation Scheme in order to downsize the staff.  The Petitioner-workmen submitted that about 2,400 employees had applied for the scheme, but no period was provided to the employee to withdraw himself from the scheme. It was alleged that under the threat of being transferred to other areas, the Petitioners were compelled to apply under the scheme.  The Company on the other hand averred that up to the designated date, 19 employees had made applications for withdrawal and they were allowed to do so. The present Petitioners had not withdrawn their applications before the acceptance. Moreover, they had accepted all benefits flowing from the scheme and thereafter initiated an industrial dispute.  Petitioners contended that the scheme remained in operation upto 20th March 2007 and thus, the occasion to decide the applications was available with the Company only from 21st March onwards. They added that since the Petitioners had withdrawn their applications before despatch of letters of acceptance on 26th March, thus there was no acceptance of the proposal under the Contract Act.  The Company opposed this submission on the ground that the acceptance was complete as under Sections 4 and 5 of the Contract Act. The Petitioners had accepted the benefits and were now estopped from challenging the same before the Labour Court. Findings  Perusing these contentions, the High Court explained that once VRS applications were sent and not withdrawn before the deadline of 20th March, the contention of the Petitioners vis-a-vis offer and acceptance of Contract cannot be countenanced. It noted that the entire process was digital, since the acceptance had been sent through an online system. The Labour Court had also rightly found that there was no request for oral withdrawal as was suggested by the Petitioners. Addressing the issue under the Contract Act, Justice Vaishnav clarified:  "…considering the question of the effective date, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that non communication of acceptance does not make the resignation inoperative provided there is in fact an acceptance before withdrawal."  Relying on National Textile Corporation (MP) Ltd. v. M.R. Jadav, Justice Vaishnav averred:  "…the Hon'ble Supreme Court opined that if the contractual scheme gives the option to an employee to voluntarily retire in terms of the scheme and if there is no condition that it will be effective only on acceptance of the employer, the scheme gives an enforceable right to the employee to retire by exercising his option in such a situation a provision in the contractual scheme that the employee will not be entitled to withdraw the option once made will be valid and binding and consequently an employee will not be entitled to withdraw from the option exercise."  Keeping in view these settled principles of law, the High Court held that the Labour Court's award did not suffer from any flaws which would merit the High Court's interference.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that a child in conflict with the law as per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) can not file an application under Section 438 of CrPC seeking anticipatory bail. "In case, the provisions of Section 438 Cr.P.C. are allowed to hold the field in the matters of juvenile, the aim and object of the Act shall be defeated. The interpretation of law cannot be devised in a way, so as to put a hurdle in the broader and solemn aim which is sought to be achieved by this enactment," the Court said. With this, the bench of Justice Jyotsna Sharma disagreed with the Bombay High Court's last year ruling in the case of Raman & Manthan v. The State of Maharashtra  (Bom) 253 and instead found weightage in the ruling of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Shahaab Ali and Another vs. the State of U.P.; 2020 (2) ADJ 130 "I am of the firm view that the Juvenile Justice Act is a comprehensive legislation containing all provisions with regard to children in conflict with law and that the provisions of Section 438 Cr.P.C. have no application being extraneous and incompatible with the scheme, as well as aim and objective, sought to be achieved by the Act," the Court aid as it dismissed an anticipatory bail plea moved under section 438 CrPC by the father of a minor (child in conflict with the law) facing FIR under Sections 307, 504 and 506 IPC. The case in brief While filing the anticipatory bail under Section 438, the Counsels appearing for the minor argued that a minor cannot be deprived of protection available under Section 438 Cr.P.C. just because he is not an adult. On the other hand, this contention was ardently opposed by the State. In view of the conflict in the views of both the parties, the Court examined the question before it as it whether a CCL can seek anticipatory bail under Section 438 CrPC.  Court's analysis At the outset, the Court perused the objectives of the JJ Act and noted that it seeks to deal exhaustively with all matters concerning child offenders including their apprehension, detention, and prosecution. Further, taking into account the content of Section 4 (2) CrPC, the Court observed that the provisions of Cr.P.C. shall apply only where the special enactment is silent on a particular issue. Against this backdrop, the Court examined the issue as to whether the applicability of Section 438 Cr.P.C. has been ruled out by implication or otherwise in cases where the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 is applicable or not? The Court observed that under Section 8 (1) of the Juvenile Justice Act, the Juvenile Justice Board has been given exclusive power to deal with all the proceedings under the Act relating to children in conflict with law and in the Act, no window has been left open for meddling with the affairs of juvenile offenders in terms of provisions of Section 438 Cr.P.C. "The Juvenile Justice Act has no where said that Section 438 Cr.P.C. shall have application to the children in conflict with law. Though Section 8(2) of the Juvenile Justice Act gives similar powers to the High Court or the Children Court but only when matter is brought before it in appeal or revision or otherwise. There is no express provision empowering Children Court or Sessions Court or High Court to assume jurisdiction on itself for grant of anticipatory bail by virtue of provisions of Section 8(2) of the Juvenile Justice Act," the Court observed. Further, the Court also stressed that there is some commonality between the term arrest and apprehension, however, a milder term of apprehension has been preferred (for a child in conflict with the law) over the other to clinch the idea behind the enactment of this special law and to bring home the essential difference with the term arrest in the sense used in other statutes as the custody of a juvenile is not punitive in nature and is a protective one. In this regard, the Court also took into account the mandate of Section 12 of the JJ Act [Bail of juvenile] to note that it does not provide for any distinction for applicability of provisions of bail on the lines as has been maintained under the provision of Section 436 to 439 of Cr.P.C. The Court added that the natural and literal meaning of Section 12 indicated that notwithstanding the category of offences for which the child in conflict with law has been produced or brought before or appeared before the Board, he may be released on bail or he may not be so released and placed under the supervision of a probationary officer or under the care of any fit person and when he is not being released, he can only be kept in an observation home or a place of safety. "The provisions as discussed above are fundamentally different from the provisions of bail under Cr.P.C. The apprehension of arrest which is a necessary pre-requisite for applicability of Section 438 Cr.P.C. is altogether out of place in cases of juveniles. In my view the word "arrest" is not replaceable by the word "apprehension" in the sense used under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act," the Court added. Consequently, the Court held that a distinct and special procedure with regard to a child offender has been put in place in the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 so as to comprehensively deal with all the aspects which may arise where a criminal case, whether initiated by the filing of FIR or not begins and the Act contains many indicators which rule out forming of a view or an opinion that provisions of anticipatory bail shall apply to protect the liberty of a juvenile.

A 3-judge Bench of the Supreme Court has referred to a larger bench the issue whether a person, on the strength of a driving licence for Light Motor Vehicles(LMV), can drive a Transport Vehicle having unladen weight below 7500 kilograms. A 3-judge Bench comprising Justice UU Lalit, Ravindra Bhat and PS Narasimha doubted the correctness of the decision given by a coordinate bench in the case Mukund Dewangan v. Oriental Insurance Company Limited (2017) 14 SCC 663. In Mukund Dewangan, a 3-judge Bench had held that a person holding a driving licence in respect of "light motor vehicle", could on the strength of that licence, be entitled to drive a "transport vehicle of light motor vehicle class" having unladen weight not exceeding 7500 kgs. A bench comprising Justice Amitava Roy, Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul held in Mukund Dewangan that a separate endorsement in the LMV driving licence is not required to drive a transport vehicle having unladen weight below 7500 kilograms. The bench held in Mukund Dewangan as follows : "A transport vehicle and omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of either of which does not exceed 7,500 kg would be a light motor vehicle and also motor car or tractor or a road roller, 'unladen weight' of which does not exceed 7,500 kg and holder of a driving licence to drive class of "light motor vehicle" as provided in section 10(2)(d) is competent to drive a transport vehicle or omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of which does not exceed 7,500 kg or a motor car or tractor or road-roller, the "unladen weight" of which does not exceed 7,500 kg". On May 3, 2018, a two-judge Bench in the case Bajaj Alliance General Insurance v Rambha Devi doubted the correctness of Mukund Dewangan and referred the matter a 3-judge bench observing that the decision was rendered ignoring certain relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act such as Section 4(1), Section 7, Section 14, Rule 5 and 31 of The Central Rules Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The referral order noted that Section 4 provides for different minimum age criteria for LMV and transport licences - 18 years for the former and 20 years for the latter. Also, as per Section 7, a person should have held LMV driving licence for at least one year to seek learners license for transport vehicle. Section 14 provides different periods for the validity of LMV and transport licences. Rule 5 prescribes a medical certificate to apply for transport licence whereas in the case of LMV, only a self declaration is sufficient. Rule 31, specifically sub-rules (2), (3) and (4) provide for a difference in the syllabus and duration of training between transport and non-transport vehicles. The Bench took note of the submission that though Section 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act was quoted in the decision in Mukund Dewangan, the latter part of Section 3 and the effect thereof was not noticed by the Court. The latter part of said Section 3 stipulates that "no person shall so drive a transport vehicle other than the motor cab or motor cycle hired for his own use or rented under any scheme made under any scheme made under sub-section (2) of Section 75 unless his driving licence specifically entitles him so to do. Senior Counsels appearing for Insurance Companies also drew the attention of the three-judge Bench towards several other provisions including the second proviso to Section 15 and Sections 180 and 181 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The Bench noted the submissions that the provisions contemplate different regimes for those having licence to drive Light Motor Vehicles as against those licensed to drive Transport Vehicles. The 3-judge Bench observed that the referral order is right and that the issue needs to be re-visited. "Having bestowed our attention to the contentions raised by the learned counsel and the issues which fall for consideration, in our view, the referral order was right in stating that certain provisions were not noticed by this Court in its decision in Mukund Dewangan (supra). We are prima facie of the view that in terms of the referral order, the controversy in question needs to be re- visited" However, since Mukund Dewangan was also rendered by a 3-judge bench, the bench said that it is appropriate that a larger bench decides the matter. "Sitting in a combination of Three Judges, we deem it appropriate to refer the matters to a larger bench of more than Three Judges as the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India may deem appropriate to constitute". The Court has therefore directed the Registry to place the Special leave petitions before the CJI to constitute a Bench of appropriate strength to consider all the issues. Mr. Jayant Bhushan, Mr. Gopal Sankaranaryanan, Mr. Siddhartha Dave,Senior Advocates as well as Mr. Amit Singh, Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, Mr. Kaustubh Shukla, Ms. Meenakshi Midha and Mr. Rajesh Kumar Gupta, Advocates, appeared for the insurance companies in the matter. The Bench recorded their statement that the compensation in terms of the directions issued by the Courts below following the principles laid down in Mukund Dewangan (supra) has either been paid in full or shall be paid in terms of such directions.

Punjab and Haryana High Court recently held that the claimants in the proceedings under Motor Vehicles Act 1988 need to prove their case on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities. However, it denied the claim in the instant case while stating that the claimants had not been able to even 'remotely prove' the factum of accident against the alleged offending vehicle. The bench comprising Justice Alka Sarin was dealing with an appeal against the award passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala whereby the claim petition filed by the claimant-appellants was dismissed.  The court observed that the entire story set up by the claimants seems improbable in as much as:  The person who was a witness to a serious accident and was stated to have chased the offending truck for 1½ kilometers to note down its registration number, would not inform the Police when admittedly he had a mobile phone and had been using the said mobile phone to talk to his family members from village Dhanas.  Moreover, the court noted that there was also nothing on record to show that the brother of the deceased, made any effort to inform the Police about the accident as narrated by PW-2. All these circumstances make claimant's side of the story, improbable.  There was also nothing on record to show that the brother of the deceased, on coming to know of the registration number of the offending truck from PW-2 Ravinder Kumar on 14.07.2014, made any effort to inform the Police about the factum of the accident as narrated by PW-2 Ravinder Kumar.  The trite of proving the case on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities was not met in the instant case wherein the claimants have not been able to prove the factum of accident.  Consequently, the court dismissed the instant appeal finding no illegality or infirmity in the award passed by the Tribunal.  Case Title : Krishna Devi and Others v. Balvinder Singh and Others   
The Madras High Court has ordered that SpiceJet Limited must be wound up and the assets must be taken over by the official liquidator on the grounds of proved inability of the Airlines to repay its debts.

The Madras High Court has ordered that SpiceJet Limited must be wound up and the assets must be taken over by the official liquidator on the grounds of proved inability of the Airlines to repay its debts.  Justice R. Subramanian was adjudicating a company petition filed by Credit Suisse AG, a Switzerland based Stock Corporation and a creditor, who alleged inability on the part of respondent Airlines to pay the debts owed to the former.  In the petition filed under Sections 433(e) and (f) r/w Sections 434 and 439 of the Companies Act, 1956, the single judge bench evoked the three-pronged test framed by the apex court in Mathusudan Gordhandas & Co. v. Madhu Woollen Industries (P) Ltd., (1971) 3 SCC 632 to determine the admission of winding up when the existence of debt is proved against SpiceJet Limited. The court iterated that the three-pronged test enunciated by the apex court involves,   Ascertaining if the defence of company is bonafide and is of substance, If such defence is likely to succeed on point of law, andIf the company produces prima facie proof of the facts on which the defence rests.  While agreeing with the submissions made by Advocate Rahul Balaji appearing for the stock corporation, Justice R Subramanian recorded on the question of enforceability of debts after referring to Mathusudan and Madras HC judgment in Michael Hart v. M/s. Ninestars Information Technologies Ltd. (2013):  "The three pronged test suggested by the Hon'ble Supreme Court which I have already extracted would show that the Company Court need not render a conclusive finding on the enforceability of the debt, while examining the issuance of notice of winding up or while examining the admission of a winding up petition. The question whether the documents require stamping or the question whether the bills of exchange are payable on demand or otherwise than on demand or questions which, as rightly pointed out by Mr. Rahul Balaji, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, will have to be examined at the time when the actual enforcement or examination of the claim of the petitioner by the Official Liquidator takes place."  Background  SpiceJet Limited (First Party) had availed the services of SR Technics(Second Party) in Switzerland for Air Craft maintenance and repair, among other related services, via an agreement that has the lifetime of 10 years, back in 2011. In 2021, a supplemental agreement was signed between the two parties that enabled the airlines to pay back the monies raised by SR Technics at various occasions through a deferred payment scheme.  Before the High Court, the contentious matter was the seven invoices raised by SR Technics, the seven corresponding Bills of Exchange for the amount due under invoices, and the acknowledgement of debts through issuance of certificates of acceptance by the Airlines. In 2012, the stock corporation Credit Suisse AG (Third Party) was assigned all the rights to receive payments due to SR Technics through a financial agreement. The assignment also entitled the third party to receive payments from SpiceJet under the seven invoices issued by SR Technics.  Even after repeated requests, SpiceJet shrugged off its responsibility to pay the monies due under the invoices, that too after a statutory notice under Sections 433 and 434 of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, the third party preferred a company petition for winding up under Section 433 (e), citing the inability on the part of the first party airlines to repay the debts.  Arguments Raised  The petitioner counsel, Advocate Rahul Balaji, argued before the court that a debt exists and a notice was issued under the Companies Act to the Airlines. Once a notice has been issued under Section 434(1) (a) of the Act and the failure of the company which in receipt of the said notice to repay the amount within three weeks or to secure the debt or to compound for it becomes evident, the winding-up procedure inevitably follows. To dispute the admission of winding up, the respondent company should prove a bona fide dispute or unenforceability of debt under Indian law, contended Mr. Balaji.  The counsel argued that the Airlines has not disputed the utilisation of services by SR Technics. This, along with the fact that the invoices were accepted, Bills of Exchange and Certificates of Acceptance were issued by the first party airlines negates their argument that the debt is non-enforceable. The counsel also added that the dissection of debt enforceability is not warranted at the stage of admission of winding up; it is the duty of official liquidator to examiner the same and not the court's responsibility. The dispute on the adequacy of stamping the instruments need not be looked into at this stage, concluded the counsel.  About the lack of a valid license for aircraft maintenance, the counsel would submit that the Debtor Company was aware of the same and still availed the services of Second Party Company. These contentions raised by the Airlines were rejected during the arbitration proceedings in UK as well, added Mr. Balaji.  Along with the arguments that it was a bona fide dispute and the debt was unenforceable, Senior Advocate V. Ramakrishnan would submit that there wasn't a contractual relationship between the Airlines and the Stock Corporation. He also argued that the assignment of rights was contrary to the agreement between SR Technics and SpiceJet. Another argument was raised by the respondent airlines that SR Technics did not have a valid license to carry out Air Craft maintenance services from the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and therefore the enforcement of the claim would be against public policy.   The counsel would also argue that the Bills of Exchange are not payable on demand since a fixed date of six months from the date of issue has been mentioned, which makes stamping a prerequisite for those instruments. In the absence of stamping, the Bills of Exchange and agreements can't be considered as a valid evidence of existing debt, argued the Senior Counsel. In addition to the arguments about the improper stamping of instruments ranging from original and supplemental agreements, Invoices, Bills of Exchange and Certificates of Acceptance, the counsel also put forward an argument that the arbitral award in UK in favour of corporation cannot be a ground before Madras High Court where the Indian Laws would apply. Finally, he also submitted that the endorsement of Bills of Exchange are not in the form required as per the agreement between the Stock Corporation and SR Technics, which renders the endorsements on the instrument invalid.  Court's Observations And Findings  Placing reliance on Section 434(1)(a) and Section 433 of the Companies Act, the court observed:  "Once a notice is issued under Section 434 of the Companies Act, a deeming fiction is created regarding the inability to pay the debt, therefore it becomes the obligation on the part of the respondent/debtor Company to show that the debt itself is illegal or that there is no debt at all, if it has to escape the consequence of issuance of a winding up notice."  The court noted that the existence of the debt has been proved in the case at hand due to the deeming fiction created by Section 434 of the Act. The primary question before the court would be then to test the bona fides of defences put forward by the debtor company against the standards of three-pronged test formulated by the apex court.  "I therefore do not propose to go into the requirements as to stamping. I must point out, even ignoring the agreements and the bills of exchange, the certificates of acceptance that had been issued by the respondent would show that there is a categorical admission of liability. Each of the bills of exchange is supported by a certificate of acceptance. The respondent has not denied the execution of the certificates of acceptance", the court observed in the order.  In addition to the apex court judgment and the Madras High Court DB judgment in Michael Hart, the court also referred to the Bombay High Court Judgment in Classic Diamonds (India) Ltd., v. ICICI Bank Limited (2016) to opine that the question relating to stamping or sufficiency of stamping is really foreign to the scope of the proceedings, i.e., admission of winding up.  "When a Division Bench of this Court had categorically laid down that even production of the document is unnecessary as the execution of the document is not denied, I do not think it will be proper for me to dwell into the aspect of stamping or the character of the document whether it is a bill of exchange payable on demand or it is a bill of exchange payable otherwise on demand etc. in these proceedings", the court made one of its final observations on the aspect of deciding the enforceability of debts at this stage.  On the SpiceJet's submission that endorsements made are not in the proper form as stipulated by the agreement, the court opines that the Airlines was aware of the ability of SR Technics to endorse the Bills of Exchange in favour of Credit Suisse AG since the 2012 supplemental agreement between SpiceJet and SR Technics had a clause to that effect. It was only in pursuance of the agreement that certificates of acceptance in support of such Bills of Exchange were issued by the respondent company.  The court also places on record that by virtue of the said supplemental agreement, the respondent company could avail a six months deferred payment scheme.  "Therefore, it is clear that the respondent Company had obtained an advantage of a deferred payment by execution of these documents and the denial there of, in my considered opinion, cannot be said to be bona fide. Having obtained an advantage under the supplementary agreement and having executed the documents as required, the respondent cannot now seek to evade liability raising technical objections relating to stamping of the instrument", the court made its observations on the bona fides of defence set out by the Airlines.  On the respondent counsel's arguments pertaining to the lack of SR Technic's License to carry out Air Craft Maintenance as per DGCA, the court gave its attention to a particular clause(Clause 14.3) in the agreement between SpiceJet and SR Technics, which would have allowed the former to terminate the agreement by a written notice in case any certification required by SR Technics was revoked or suspended by the concerned authorities:  "It is not in dispute that the respondent Company had not invoked Clause 14.3 and terminated the agreement. It chooses to avail of the services of SR Technics despite being aware of the fact that SR Technics did not possess a valid authorisation by DGCA."  Further, Clause 14.4 of the agreement requires both parties to fulfil all obligations prior to the termination of agreement under Clause 14.3. It was also open to the parties to make claims for breach of obligations under the agreement even post termination of the agreement. The court interpreted this clause to hold as follows:  "…while it was open to SpiceJet Limited to terminate the contract for the reason that SR Technics did not have a valid authorisation the termination by itself would not relive SpiceJet Limited of the obligations that arose under the contract prior to such termination becoming effective."  Accordingly, the court held that the respondent company has 'failed miserably' to satisfy the three-pronged test of the apex court on the bona fides of defences set out, and that the company should be wound up for its inability to pay the debt owed under Section 433 (e) of the Companies Act 1956.  Finally, on the operation of the said order, the senior counsel for respondents requested two weeks' stay to allow themselves time for filing an appeal. The court has acceded to the same by granting a stay on the operation of order for a period of three weeks, provided that SpiceJet Limited deposits an amount equivalent to five million dollars to the credit of Company Petition No.363/2015 within a period of two weeks from the date of the order.

The Gujarat High Court has ruled that petition for referring the matter to arbitration cannot be disallowed on the ground that the dispute involves interpretation of policy guidelines.  The Single Bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar held that whether there is an arbitrable dispute or not and whether the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute is an issue which can be decided by the arbitrator himself under Section 16 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  The petitioner M/S Bharmal Indane Service was allotted dealership by respondent Indian Oil Corporation Limited for dealing in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and a dealership agreement was entered into between the parties. During the year 2020, an inspection team had conducted inspection and communicated to the petitioner several irregularities committed by it. Thereafter, a letter was addressed to the petitioner imposing penalty on it. The petitioner filed a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) before the Allahabad High Court for appointment of an arbitrator and reference of the dispute to arbitration.  The Counsel for Indian Oil Corporation submitted before the High Court that the dispute raised by the petitioner related to the interpretation of a policy decision which could not be resolved through arbitration. He contended that the validity of the guidelines on the basis of which penalty was imposed on the petitioner could not be questioned before the arbitrator, therefore there was no need for appointment of an arbitrator. It was also averred that if any arbitrator was to be appointed, only the person specified in the arbitration agreement should be nominated.  The High Court held that undisputedly the parties had agreed for resolution of dispute through arbitration. The Court ruled that whether there was an arbitrable dispute or not and whether the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute is an issue which can be decided by the arbitrator himself by ruling on its jurisdiction under Section 16 of the A&C Act.  The Court held that petition for referring the matter to arbitration cannot be denied on the ground that the dispute involved interpretation of policy guidelines.  The Court added that the contention of the respondent Indian Oil Corporation that only the person named in the arbitration agreement alone should be nominated cannot stand the test of law. The Court noted that the arbitration clause provided for reference of the dispute to a sole arbitrator who is an officer of the Corporation. The Court ruled that in light of Section 12 (5) of the A&C Act read with the Seventh Schedule to the Act, officials or persons interested in the outcome of the dispute cannot be held as persons competent to arbitrate.  The High Court thus allowed the petition and nominated a Sole Arbitrator. The Court added that the arbitrator would be at liberty to decide the issue with regard to jurisdiction and arbitrability of the dispute.

In a significant development, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday said that a statement by a minister would be actionable as a constitutional tort if such a statement leads to an act or omission by officers of the state resulting in harm or loss to a person or citizen. “A mere statement made by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part III of the Constitution, may not constitute a violation of the constitutional rights and become actionable as constitutional tort. But if as a consequence of such a statement, any act of omission or commission is done by the officers resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, then the same may be actionable as a constitutional tort", a Constitution Bench of the Court held by 4:1 majority in the case Kaushal Kishore vs State of UP.       Justice V. Ramasubramanian, writing the majority judgement on behalf of himself, and Justices S. Abdul Nazeer, B.R. Gavai, and A.S. Bopanna, highlighted how the top court has, on several occasions, awarded compensation in public law, invoking the principle of constitutional tort, either expressly or impliedly. Although the judge observed that constitutional courts have consistently invoked constitutional tort whenever an act of omission and commission on the part of a public functionary, including a minister, caused harm or loss, he also recognised the merit in the contention of the Attorney-General for India, R. Venkataramani, that a proper legal framework needed to be designed by the Parliament “so that the principles and procedure are coherently set out without leaving the matter open-ended or vague”. It was noted in the majority judgement that the Law Commission in 1956 had outlined certain principles on which appropriate legislation on the tortious liability of the state would proceed, in its first report on the ‘Liability of the State in Tort’, and that based on the report, a bill known as the Government (Liability in Torts) Bill was introduced in 1967 after the Supreme Court in Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1965 SC 1039 recommended a legislative measure on the subject-matter. However, Justice Ramasubramanian observed with dismay, neither did the proposed legislation pass parliamentary muster nor was any effort made subsequently to codify the law on the state’s liability in tort. He said, “Nothing [has] happened in the past 55 years. In such circumstances, courts cannot turn a blind eye but may have to imaginatively fashion the remedy to be provided to persons who suffer injury or loss, without turning them away on the ground that there is no proper legal framework.” Also from the judgment - No One Can Be Penalised For Holding An Opinion Not In Confirmity With Constitutional Values: Supreme Court Having explained the rationale behind the decision, Justice Ramasubramanian then proceeded to answer the question of whether a statement by a minister inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part III of the Constitution constituted a violation of such constitutional rights and would be actionable as a constitutional tort, in the affirmative. However, he qualified his answer with an important precondition.  Justice Nagarathna Dissents Notably, Justice B.V. Nagarathna took a different stand with respect to the liability of a minister under constitutional tort law for a disparaging or derogatory statement affronting the fundamental rights of a person or a citizen. While her colleagues on the bench held that damages could be sought for such ministerial statements, not made in an official capacity, provided that such a statement resulted in any act or omission by state officers leading to harm or loss, Justice Nagarathna highlighted the practical difficulty of permitting such statements to, as a norm, be challenged before constitutional courts exercising their writ jurisdiction. After the decisions in Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 141 and Chairman, Railway Board v. Chandrima Das, (2000) 2 SCC 465, Justice Nagarathna noted, “a public law action seeking monetary compensation for violation of fundamental rights was no longer an action in lieu of a private law claim, but was to serve an independent and more important purpose”. However, it could not be ignored that the decisions to award compensation in such cases proceeded on the basis of lower evidentiary standards. Furthermore, factual disputes also operated on a writ court’s ability to treat a matter as a constitutional tort, even though the Supreme Court has nevertheless awarded monetary compensation in many cases, particularly where the violation of fundamental rights by the state or its instrumentalities is writ large upon the facts. Writ courts, she said, would also feel reluctant to grant relief to litigants seeking damages in a writ petition or a public interest litigation against the state, in light of the alternative civil and criminal remedies available. Justice Nagarathna explained that even though scholars believed that constitutional tort challenged the ability of law to deter socially harmful behaviour of different kinds by forcing the perpetrator to internalise the costs of their actions, since a constitutional tort action imposed the burden of damages on an entity other than the violator of the right, “a doubt has been cast on its effectiveness in serving as a vehicle of corrective justice”. According to her, owing to these reasons, it would not be prudent to treat all cases where a statement made by a public functionary has resulted in harm or loss to a person or citizen, as a constitutional tort. The caveat, she supplied was where the statement is traceable to any affairs of the state or for the protection of the government and embodies the views of the government itself. Also from the judgment - Article 19 & 21 Rights Can Be Enforced Against Private Individuals & Entities : Supreme Court Holds By 4:1 Majority In this connection, Justice Nagarathna also sounded a word of caution against indiscriminately granting monetary compensation as a means for the ‘vindication of fundamental rights’. Central to the determination of a constitutional tort action are the nature of the resultant harm or loss, and the causal connection between the act or omission and the consequent infraction of fundamental rights. “In the absence of a clear, cogent, and comprehensive legal framework based on judicial precedent, which would clarify what harm or injury is actionable as a constitutional tort, such a device is to be resorted to only in cases where there are brutal violations of fundamental rights,” she said. Thus, this remedy was available not as a norm, but only in exceptional circumstances. While the device of constitutional tort has been evolved by jurisprudential labour to tackle ‘particularly extreme and threatening situations’, “it must be borne in mind that the tool of treating an action as a constitutional tort must not be wielded only in instances wherein state lawlessness and indifference to the right to life and personal liberties have caused immense suffering,” she said. Invocation of writ jurisdiction to grant damages, by treating acts and omissions of agencies of the state as constitutional torts, must, she insisted, be an exception rather than a rule. Further, she recommended the promulgation of a proper legal framework to define the acts or omissions amounting to constitutional tort and the manner in which they would be redressed or remedied on the basis of judicial precedent. In her separate opinion, Justice Nagarathna also differed from the majority of the four judges with respect to the horizontal application of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 19 and 21. She said that permitting such constitutionally consecrated rights to operate against private individuals and entities, unless those rights were recognised statutorily as well, would be fraught with practical difficulties. However, she made an exception for the specific case where a writ of habeas corpus is issued against a private person or entity for illegally and arbitrarily detaining the right-holder. She said, “In my humble view, an illegal detention is a violation of Article 21 of the constitution irrespective whether the detention is by the state or by a private person. Therefore, in the context of the remedy of writ of habeas corpus, Article 21 would operate horizontally.”  Furthermore, Justice Nagarathna asserted that the duty of the state under Article 21 was negative inasmuch as it was only required to not deprive a person of their right to life and liberty, except in accordance with the law. Unlike the majority of the judges who decided to impart a positive character to the state’s constitutional duty under the particular article, Justice Nagarathna observed, “This court has not recognised an affirmative duty of the state under Article 21 of the Constitution to protect the rights of a citizen against the threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omission of another citizen or private agency.” In her part dissent, Justice Nagarathna furthers proposed to hold the government vicariously liable for a statement made by a minister that is traceable to any affairs of the state or for the protection of the government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility, while the other four judges on the Constitution Bench, rejected the contention that vicarious liability could be envisaged in such a situation. Justice Nagarathna, the junior-most judge on the bench, was the lone dissenting voice. The other reports about the judgment can be read here. Case Title Kaushal Kishor v. State of UP | WP (Crl) No. 113/2016   
The Supreme Court has observed that the the dismissal of special leave petition is of no consequence on the question of law.In this case, the Division Bench of the High Court set aside the Single Bench judgment that allowed the writ petitions for the grant of 9/16 years' time bound revised promotional scale to the petitioners. The division bench had followed the dictum of the judgment... The Supreme Court has observed that the the dismissal of special leave petition is of no consequence on the question of law. In this case, the Division Bench of the High Court set aside the Single Bench judgment that allowed the writ petitions for the grant of 9/16 years' time bound revised promotional scale to the petitioners. The division bench had followed the dictum of the judgment in Bhakra Beas Management Board v. Krishan Kumar Vij to hold that the petitioners are not entitled to relief sought. Before the Apex Court, it was contended that some other employees have been granted benefit by virtue of the orders passed by the High Court and the Special Leave Petitions were dismissed. They pointed out that a writ petition filed by an employee junior to them as Assistant Engineer (Civil) was allowed by the Division Bench of the High Court and SLP filed against this was dismissed by the Apex Court. In this context, the bench observed: "We find that some other employees have been granted benefit by virtue of the orders passed by the High Court. However, the principle laid down in the aforesaid judgments run counter to the subsequent judgment of this Court in Krishan Kumar Vij. The Special Leave Petition in many of these cases were dismissed but the such dismissals would not be a binding precedent for this Court. This argument was also raised and examined in Krishan Kumar Vij wherein this Court relied upon the judgment of this Court reported as Kunhayammed & Ors v. State Of Kerala (2000) 6 SCC 359. Therefore, the dismissal of special leave petitions is of no consequence on the question of law." In Kunhayammed case, the Supreme Court has considered the legal implications and the impact of an order rejecting a petition seeking grant of special leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. The court concluded as follows:  Where an appeal or revision is provided against an order passed by a court, tribunal or any other authority before superior forum and such superior forum modifies, reverses or affirms the decision put in issue before it, the decision by the subordinate forum merges in the decision by the superior forum and it is the latter which subsists, remains operative and is capable of enforcement in the eye of law.The jurisdiction conferred by Article 136 of the Constitution is divisible into two stages. First stage is upto the disposal of prayer for special leave to file an appeal. The second stage commences if and when the leave to appeal is granted and special leave petition is converted into an appeal. Doctrine of merger is not a doctrine of universal or unlimited application. It will depend on the nature of jurisdiction exercised by the superior forum and the content or subject-matter of challenge laid or capable of being laid shall be determinative of the applicability of merger. The superior jurisdiction should be capable of reversing, modifying or affirming the order put in issue before it. Under Article 136 of the Constitution the Supreme Court may reverse, modify or affirm the judgment-decree or order appealed against while exercising its appellate jurisdiction and not while exercising the discretionary jurisdiction disposing of petition for special leave to appeal. The doctrine of merger can therefore be applied to the former and not to the latter.An order refusing special leave to appeal may be a non- speaking order or a speaking one. In either case it does not attract the doctrine of merger. An order refusing special leave to appeal does not stand substituted in place of the order under challenge. All that it means is that the Court was not inclined to exercise its discretion so as to allow the appeal being filed.If the order refusing leave to appeal is a speaking order, i.e. gives reasons for refusing the grant of leave, then the order has two implications. Firstly, the statement of law contained in the order is a declaration of law by the Supreme Court within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution. Secondly, other than the declaration of law, whatever is stated in the order are the findings recorded by the Supreme Court which would bind the parties thereto and also the court, tribunal or authority in any proceedings subsequent thereto by way of judicial discipline, the Supreme Court being the apex court of the country. But, this does not amount to saying that the order of the court, tribunal or authority below has stood merged in the order of the Supreme Court rejecting special leave petition or that the order of the Supreme Court is the only order binding as res judicata in subsequent proceedings between the parties.Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court has been invoked the order passed in appeal would attract the doctrine of merger; the order may be of reversal, modification or merely affirmation.On an appeal having been preferred or a petition seeking leave to appeal having been converted into an appeal before Supreme Court the jurisdiction of High Court to entertain a revew petition is lost thereafter as provided by sub-rule (1) of Rule (1) of Order 47 of the C.P.C.

The Bombay High Court has granted bail to the owner of a building in Mumbai's Malwani area which collapsed last year, killing 9 of his own family members.  Justice Bharati Dangre, while granting bail to Mohammed Rafique Siddiqui earlier this month, observed, "The applicant, in any case, cannot be attributed a rash and negligent act, resulting into the collapse of the building where he himself has lost his family members. He may face the consequences of the trial when the prosecution will establish and connect him to the grave and negligent act. However, at present, in the wake of the nature of the offence and the evidence collected by the prosecution and compiled in the charge-sheet, the applicant cannot be continued in detention and deserve his release on bail."  A ground plus two storey structure collapsed on June 10 last year in Mumbai's western suburb Malad, killing 11 people of which 8 were children. Of the 12 who lost their lives, 9 belonged to Siddiqui's family – Siddiqui's wife, his brother and brother's wife and six minor children. The structure was only 8-years old at that time.  An FIR was registered under various sections of IPC pertaining to causing death and grievous injuries by negligence and the contractor Ramzan Nabi Shaikh was arrested the same day. Shaikh's bail application was rejected in July last year on the basis of gravity of the accusation and the material compiled in the charge-sheet showing that he was responsible for carrying out the construction of the building which was found to be of inferior quality.  Siddiqui surrendered at the time of filing of the charge sheet on August 9 last year and has been in custody since then. His bail application was rejected once last year.  Advocate Mubin Solkar, appearing for Siddiqui, submitted before the High Court that the structure had developed cracks due to Nisarg cyclone and Siddiqui had got the repair work done immediately after this was brought to his notice.  On this aspect Justice Dangre noted, "Statement of one Mohd Junaid Mohd Javed Siddiqui to that effect is recorded and compiled in the charge-sheet. Statement of Munir Shaikh (complainant) is also on similar lines, where he stated that when the attention of the applicant/occupant of the said house was brought to the cracks developed in the building, he informed him that he had taken appropriate steps and confirmed that the building is stable."  The court ordered his release on bail on furnishing P R bond for Rs 25,000 with one or two sureties of the like amount. He has been directed to not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing the facts to Court or any Police Officer, and to not tamper with evidence. He has also been asked to report to the concerned police station on the first Monday of trimester.   Case Title : Mohammad Rafique Mohammad Saleem Siddiqui v The State of Maharashtra   
The Supreme Court, on Thursday, directed Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to issue Aadhaar Cards to sex workers on the basis of a proforma certification submitted by a Gazetted Officer at NACO or the Project Director of the State Aids Control Society.  A Bench comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao, B.R. Gavai and A.S. Bopanna asked UIDAI to ensure that confidentiality of the sex workers is maintained in the process of issuance of Aadhar Cards.  "There shall be no breach of confidentiality in the process, including assignment of any code in the Aadhar enrolment numbers that identify the card holder as a sex worker." On an earlier occasion, Senior Advocate, Anand Grover, appearing on behalf of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee had apprised the Bench that Aadhar Cards were not being issued to sex workers without any proof of residence. In the affidavit filed by UIDAI, it had suggested that the sex workers who are on NACO's list and apply for Aadhar card, but are unable to submit proof of residence, could be issued the same, subject to production of proforma certificate by Gazetted Officer at NACO or the State Health Department verifying their particulars.  Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee had also made some suggestions in this regard, which are as under -  The Gazetted Officer of the State Health Department, who is authorized to submit the proforma certificate for a sex worker who applies for an Aadhar Card but is unable to furnish proof of residence should be specifically designated as:- "The Project Director of the State AIDS Control Society, or her/his nominee." The name and designation of the Gazette Officers who will be authorised to submit the 'proforma certificate' for sex workers desirous of applying for an Aadhar Card on behalf of NACO must be publicized on its website.NACO and the State AIDS Control Societies should publicize the procedure for sex workers who wish to apply for an Aadhar Card but who cannot furnish proof of residence through their websites as well as through outreach under the Targetted Intervention Programmes that they implement.The sample 'proforma certificate' submitted by UIDAI in its Additional affidavit dated 09.02.2022 in terms of the order dated 10.01.2022 as "Annexure R-1' on pages 5 and 6 of the said affidavit may be made readily available on the websites of UIDAI, NACO and State Aids Control Societies.There should be no breach of confidentiality in the process, including assignment of any code in the Aadhar enrolment numbers that identity the applicant/holder of the card as a sex worker.The procedure proposed by the UIDAI in its Additional affidavit dated 09.02.2011 may not be restricted to sex workers on the NACO list but also extended to those who are identified by CBOs after verification by the State Legal Services Authority or the State AIDS control Society. This is in line with the Hon'ble Court's directions to State Governments to extend dry ration support and access to ration cards and voter ID cards to sex workers who are not on NACO's list, vide orders dated 10.01.2022 and 28.02.2022.  The aforementioned suggestions were accepted by UIDAI.   The Apex Court had directed all the States to provide dry rations to sex workers, who are identified by NACO, without insisting on any proof of identity. In the meanwhile the Court directed the State Governments to issue them voter id and ration cards. Rivetingly, the said recommendation was made almost a decade back, by a Court appointed Panel for sex workers and accordingly directions were passed by the Apex Court far back in September, 2011, but is to be implemented.

The Karnataka High Court has said that courts are bound to take into consideration all the contentions raised by the parties while hearing a bail petition filed before it and then pass an appropriate order.  A single judge bench of Justice Mohammad Nawaz while granting bail to Nelson Raj and three other accused said,  "When a bail petition is filed, the Court is bound to take into consideration all the contentions raised and pass an appropriate order. It is necessary to look into the material on record which prima facie connects the accused with the crime and adverting to those materials, Court can come to the conclusion as to whether a prima facie case has been made out or not and shall assign reasons for either allowing or rejecting a bail petition."  Case Details:  The accused were charged under Sections 302, 120B and 149 of IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The complaint was lodged by one Lakshmamma, mother of deceased Harish. It was alleged that her son was murdered by one Rakshith and his associates by assaulting him with deadly weapons.  The appellants preferred a petition under Section 439 of CrPC before the Special Court, praying to enlarge them on bail, which was rejected vide impugned order 25.11.2021.  Petitioner's submissions:  It was contended that after the arrest of the accused persons, the alleged eye witnesses namely CWs.3 and 4 did not identify them. Further, there were contradictions in their statements recorded under Section 164 of CrPC. The names of other accused persons except accused No.1 were not in the First Information Report and similarly placed accused No.6 had been enlarged on bail by the Sessions Court.  Findings:  The bench said that whereas while deciding the grant of bail, seriousness of the offence, likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, impact of release of the accused on the prosecution witnesses and likelihood of the accused tampering with evidence are primary considerations, "but, at the same time, the Court has to come to a reasonable conclusion as to whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused has committed the offence, followed by the nature and gravity of the charge and severity of the punishment."  It then opined that certain important factors relating to prima facie involvement of the accused have to be considered, though no detailed discussion regarding merits of the case is required. Where a Court considering an application for bail fails to consider the relevant factors, an appellate Court may justifiably set aside the order.  "Bail orders either granting or refusing cannot be passed in a mechanical manner or by a cryptic order, without considering the material aspects of the case. Court is duty bound to give reasons for granting or denying bail, especially in cases involving serious offences," it said.  On going through the order passed by the special court the bench held,  "The impugned order falls short of such reasoning for dismissing the bail petition. The learned Special Judge has not adverted to the various contentions stated to have been raised by the appellants counsel, except stating that accused are alleged to have committed a brutal murder of deceased and a prima facie case is made out against the accused etc."  It added, "The Special Judge has failed to advert to the various contentions said to have been raised by the Counsel appearing for the accused before the trial Court. The reasons for rejecting the prayer for bail does not appear to be in accordance with law."  Accordingly it allowed the appeal and set aside the special court order and remitted the matter back to the trial court directing it to hear the parties concerned afresh and pass orders on the bail application, in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible.

The Supreme Court has upheld the threshold limit on homebuyers - introduced by way of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code(Amendment) Act 2020 - as an attempt to "shield the corporate debtor(builder) from avoidable and frivolous applications". A bench comprising Justices R F Nariman, Navin Sinha and KM Joseph upheld Section 3 of the IBC(Amendment) Act 2020 which introduced provisos to Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 to mandate that there should be at least one hundred real estate allottees or ten percentage of the total number of allottees, which ever is lesser, to maintain an insolvency petition in respect of a real estate project. The judgment authored by Justice Joseph rejected the petitioners' contentions that such conditions on homebuyers amounted to hostile discrimination violating the equality principle under Article 14 of the Constitution. The Court held that a homebuyer, though treated as an unsecured creditor as per the judgment in Pioneer case, stands on a different footing from other creditors. "When an allottee invests money in a real estate project, his primary and principal concern is that the project is completed and he gets possession of the apartment or the flat. The problem really arises as there are many stakeholders whose interests are affected", the Court observed.    On homebuyer's application can affect the entire project The Court noted that an action under Section 7 of the Code is an action in rem. The recovery of the amounts paid is not what is primarily contemplated under the Code.The consequences of the insolvency application would be that it may land the applicant and also all the stakeholders, in liquidation of the corporate debtor. Therefore, the court said that public interest would include safeguarding the interests of all the stakeholders.  "This may necessarily include the corporate debtor as a stakeholder, being protected from applications, which are perceived as frivolous or not representing a critical mass", the Court observed. The Court also noted that the homebuyer has remedies under the RERA Act and the Consumer Protection Act against the builder for non-delivery of the apartment. Supreme Court Upholds Sections 3, 4 & 10 Of IBC Amendment Act 2020 The Court also said that the amendment has sought to strike a balance between completely taking away an allottees right to initiate insolvency and "giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage". "If the Legislature felt that having regard to the consequences of an application under the Code, when such a large group of persons, pull at each other, an additional threshold be erected for exercising the right under Section 7, certainly, it cannot suffer a constitutional veto at the hands of Court exercising judicial review of legislation", the judgment stated. "It is to be noted also that it is not a case where the right of the allottee is completely taken away. All that has happened is a half-way house is built between extreme positions, viz., denying the right altogether to the allottee to move the application under Section  of the Code and giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage to a proceeding under the Code which must certainly pass inexorably within a stipulated period of time should circumstances exists under Section 33 into corporate death with the unavoidable consequence of all allottees and not merely the applicant under Section 7 being visited with payment out of the liquidation value, the amounts which are only due to the unsecured creditor". The apex court observed that the legislature in its wisdom has felt that "greater good lies in conditioning an absolute right which existed in favour of an allottee by requirements which would ensure some certain element of consensus among the allottees". "It must be remembered that the requirement is a mere one-tenth of the allottees. This is a number which goes to policy and lies exclusively within the wisdom of the Legislature. Hence, we have no hesitation in repelling the contentions in this regard". Imposing threshold will halt indiscriminate litigation The SC observed : "Insisting on a threshold in regard to these categories of creditors would lead to the halt to indiscriminate litigation which would result in an uncontrollable docket explosion as far as the authorities which work the Code are concerned. The debtor who is apparently stressed is relieved of the last straw on the camel's back, as it were, by halting individual creditors whose views are not shared even by a reasonable number of its peers rushing in with applications. Again, as in the case of the allottees, this is not a situation where while treating them as financial creditors they are totally deprived of the right to apply under Section 7 as part of the legislative scheme. The legislative policy reflects an attempt at shielding the corporate debtor from what it considers would be either for frivolous or avoidable applications. What we mean by avoidable applications is a decision which would not be taken by similarly placed creditors keeping in mind the consequences that would ensue not only in regard to persons falling in the same category but also the generality of creditors and other stakeholders. All that the amendment is likely to ensure is that the filing of the application is preceded by a consensus at least by a minuscule percentage of similarly placed creditors that the time has come for undertaking a legal odyssey which is beset with perils for the applicants themselves apart from others. As far as the percentage of applicants contemplated under the proviso it is clear that it cannot be dubbed as an arbitrary or capricious figure. The legislature is not wanting in similar requirements under other laws. The provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and its predecessors contained similar provisions. Allowing what is described as 'lone Ranger' applications beset with extremely serious ramifications which are at cross purposes with the objects of the code. This is apart from it in particular spelling avoidable doom for the interest of the creditors falling in the same categories. The object of speed in deciding CIRP proceedings would also be achieved by applying the threshold to debenture holders and security holders. The dividing line between wisdom or policy of the legislature and limitation placed by the Constitution must not be overlooked"(paragraph 220) 'Malice' Is Not A Ground To Challenge A Law Made By Legislature : Supreme Court While agreeing that the homebuyers had a "vested right" to move the application without conditions before the amendment, the Court said that such a "vested right" can also be taken away by the legislature. "We cannot also lose sight of the fact that the Legislature has power to impair and take away vested rights", the SC observed.

The Kerala High Court recently held that the examination of a witness during trial may be conducted through video linkage mode as per the provisions of the Electronic Video Linkage Rules for Courts (Kerala), 2021 and that the same would not affect the rights of the accused. A single bench of Justice A Badharudeen noted that under Rule 8(25) Electronic Video Linkage Rules for Courts (Kerala), 2021 witness examination via video conferencing is to be treated as compliance of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Criminal Rules of Practice, Kerala and Civil Rules of Practice, Kerala. It is also applicable to any other law requiring personal appearance of parties in Subordinate Courts or Tribunals in relation to any enquiry, trial or any other proceedings, the court noted.  "The examination of the witness either through physical mode or through video linkage, the same makes no difference as far as the right of the accused to cross examine the witness is concerned," it said. The court was considering a plea challenging the order of a Special Court (CBI) that allowed the de facto complainant to be examined via video linkage facility for the reason that he was working in Dubai and his physical presence in court could not be ensured without delay or incurring expenses.   The court in this regard referred to Rule 8(23) that provides that if a person is not able to be present in court physically on account of sickness or physical infirmity or due to any genuine reason, the court can authorise the concerned person to be present through video mode.  The counsel for the Petitioner argued that for the trial to proceed effectively the witness must be present physically as this is the only way to ascertain the demeanour and approach of the witness. It was contended that to protect the interest of the accused, it was imperative to secure the physical presence of the de facto complainant.   The Deputy Solicitor General of India (DSGI) however opposed this on the ground that the purpose of Electronic Video Linkage Rules for Courts (Kerala), 2021 would be invalidated if physical presence of the witness was insisted on under every circumstance.  The court while agreeing with the DSGI on this aspect observed that:  “if the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner is accepted, the same is akin to make the Electronic Video Linkage Rules for Courts (Kerala), 2021 redundant. The principles governing interpretation do not permit interpretation of a provision of law or an enactment to make the same as redundant.”   The court in this case refused to interfere with the order of the Special Judge that allowed the examination of the de facto complainant through video linkage to prevent further delay in a case that had been pending for 11 years. The court concluded that: “Since the purpose of enactment of Electronic Video Linkage Rules for Courts (Kerala), 2021 itself is to examine the witnesses whose presence could not be secured without undue delay or expenses and for other reasons stated in Rule 8(23), a person who has been employed in Dubai whose presence could not be secured without delay and also without spending travelling and other expenses when allowed to be examined through video linkage, in terms of the rules, in such a case the petitioner has no right to say that cross examination by video linkage is not effective and as good as physical mode and, therefore, such examination should not be permitted.“  Case Title: Gopal C V Central Bureau of Investigation

The Supreme Court on Tuesday adjourned by two weeks the hearing on the application filed by political party Indian Union Muslim League(IUML) challenging the May 28 notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs allowing non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to apply for citizenship. Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the IUML, requested a vacation bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian to grant two weeks time to respond to the counter-affidavit filed by the Central Government yesterday. Accordingly, the bench adjourned the matter. Attorney General for India, KK Venugopal, appeared for the Union Government. On 28th May, 2021, the Centre issued a notification which stated that the Collectors of the districts of - (i) Morbi, Rajkot, Patan and Vadodara in the State of Gujarat ; (ii) Durg and Balodabazar in the State of Chhattisgarh ; (iii) Jalore, Udaipur, Pali, Barmer and Sirohi in the State of Rajasthan ; (iv) Faridabad in the State of Haryana; and (v) Jalandhar in the State of Punjab, have been empowered to exercise the powers of the Central Government under Section 5 for registration as a citizen of India or for grant of certificate of naturalisation under Section 6. The benefit of the notification was only for those refugees who belonged to minority communities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan(Hindus, Christians, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis). This has been challenged by the Indian Union Muslim League in an interlocutory application which contends that, "The Respondent Union, in a roundabout way, and in an attempt to circumvent the assurance given to this Hon'ble Court, have sought to implement their mala fide designs envisaged under the Citizenship Amendment Act through the recently issued order dated 28.5.2021."  The said application was filed in the writ petition filed by the IUML challenging the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019. The Centre has said that this notification has no relation to the Citizenship Amendment Act.  The Counter-Affidavit filed by the Centre submits that the impugned notification merely seeks to delegate power of the Central Government to the local authorities in particular cases.   "The said notification does not provide for any relaxations to the foreigners and applies only to foreigners who have entered the country legally as the Central Government used its authority under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act and delegated its powers to grant citizenship by Registration or Naturalisation to District Collectors. It is submitted that it merely an administrative delegation of power without any specific classification or relaxation".  Delineating the framework which governs the delegation of power notifications, the Counter-Affidavit submits that Section 16 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, confers powers on the Central Government to delegate some of its citizenship-granting powers to such officer or authority as may be specified in order to fast track the decision on citizenship applications, and the same method has been employed numerous times in the past.  "It is submitted that the said measure has been taken on numerous occasion previously and is largely a function of the administrative exigencies of the situation…It is submitted that the same would not be relatable to the legislative steps taken through the CAA which provide for a classification with a rational nexus and intelligible differentia…"  Contending that the impugned notification is merely a process of decentralization of decision-making aimed at speedy disposal of citizenship applications of foreigners, the Counter states that decision will now be taken at the District or State level itself after examining each case, and that no relaxation has been made in respect of the eligibility criteria between different foreign nationals.  "It is further submitted that the existing law and procedure for acquiring citizenship of India is in no way sought to be amended through the impugned notification. It is submitted that any foreigner of any faith can apply for citizenship of India at any time. The Central Government shall decide that application as per law and rules", states that Counter-Affidavit.   Reply available here

The Supreme Court observed that the Trial Courts, while awarding multiple punishments of imprisonment, have to specify in clear terms as to whether the sentences would run concurrently or consecutively.  Any omission to carry out this obligation causes unnecessary and avoidable prejudice to the parties, the bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose observed. The court reiterated that the omission to state whether the sentences awarded to the accused would run concurrently or would run consecutively essentially operates against the accused because, unless stated so by the Court. The omission to state the order of consecutive running cannot ipso facto lead to concurrent running of sentences, the bench said. In this case, the appellants were convicted of offences under Sections 363, 366 and 376(1) of the Indian Penal Code. The Trial Court sentenced the appellants to several punishments, but did not  specify as to whether the punishments of imprisonment would run concurrently or consecutively. The High Court, though modified the Trial Court judgment, did not clarify on this aspect in its judgment. While so, the Jail Superintendent, District Jail, Meerut, while issuing certificates of confinement, stated that the accused had undergone 10 years and 1 month of imprisonment but, there being no mention in the sentencing order about concurrent running of sentences, they were serving 22 years of imprisonment.  Advocate Amit Pai, who appeared for the accused relied on Nagaraja Rao v. Central Bureau of Investigation: (2015) 4 SCC 302 and Gagan Kumar v. State of Punjab: (2019) 5 SCC 154, to contend that it is obligatory for the Court awarding punishments to specify whether they shall be running concurrently or consecutively; and the omission on the part of the Trial Court and the High Court, to state the requisite specifications, cannot be allowed to operate detrimental to the interests of the accused-appellants. It was also contended that though as per the mandate of Section 31 CrPC, unless specified to run concurrently, the sentences do run consecutively but, for that purpose, the Court is required to direct the order in which they would run; and no such direction having been given by the Trial Court or by the High Court, it cannot be said that the Courts were consciously providing for consecutive running of sentences. Further, he also referred to judgment in O.M. Cherian alias Thankachan v. State of Kerala (2015) 2 SCC 501, to contend that it is not the normal rule that multiple sentences are to run consecutively. Referring to precedents, the bench made the following observations: 10.2. Thus, it is beyond a shadow of doubt that Section 31(1) CrPC vests complete discretion with the Court to order the sentences for two or more offences at one trial to run concurrently having regard to the nature of offences and the surrounding factors. Even though it cannot be said that consecutive running is the normal rule but, it is also not laid down that multiple sentences must run concurrently. There cannot be any straitjacket approach in the matter of exercise of such discretion by the Court; but this discretion has to be judiciously exercised with reference to the nature of the offence/s committed and the facts and circumstances of the case. However, if the sentences (other than life imprisonment) are not provided to run concurrently, one would run after the other, in such order as the Court may direct.    11. For what has been provided in Section 31(1) CrPC read with the expositions of this Court, it follows that the Court of first instance is under legal obligation while awarding multiple sentences to specify in clear terms as to whether they would run concurrently or consecutively. 12. As noticed, if the Court of first instance does not specify the concurrent running of sentences, the inference, primarily, is that the Court intended such sentences to run consecutively, though, as aforesaid, the Court of first instance ought not to leave this matter for deduction at the later stage. Moreover, if the Court of first instance is intending 10 consecutive running of sentences, there is yet another obligation on it to state the order (i.e., the sequence) in which they are to be executed. The disturbing part of the matter herein is that not only the Trial Court omitted to state the requisite specifications, even the High Court missed out such flaws in the order of the Trial Court 13. Even when we find the aforementioned shortcomings in the orders passed by the Trial Court as also by the High Court, the question is as to whether the sentences awarded to the appellants could be considered as running concurrently? As noticed, the omission to state whether the sentences awarded to the accused would run concurrently or would run consecutively essentially operates against the accused because, unless stated so by the Court, multiple sentences run consecutively, as per the plain language of Section 31(1) CrPC read with the expositions in Muthuramalingam and O.M. Cherian (supra). The other omission to state the order of consecutive running cannot ipso facto lead to concurrent running of sentences. Another contention raised was that the concurrent or consecutive running of sentences is also to be governed by 'single transaction' principle, as discernible from a combined reading of Sections 31(1) and 220(1) CrPC.  "14. Faced with the position that the stated omissions will not, by themselves, provide a room for concurrent running of sentences, learned counsel for the appellants has endeavored to invoke the 'single transaction' principle. In our view, the said principle is essentially referable to Section 220 CrPC, which provides that if more offences than one are committed in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, then the accused may be charged with and tried at one 11 trial for every such offence. In a given case, after such trial for multiple offences, if the accused is convicted and awarded different punishments, concurrent running thereof may be provided depending on the facts and the relevant surrounding factors. We are afraid, the principle related with 'single transaction' cannot be imported for dealing with the question at hand." However, taking note of the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, the court invoked its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,  and modified the punishment awarded to the appellants in the manner that the maximum period of imprisonment to be served by them in relation to offences in question shall be 14 years and not beyond.  While partly allowing the appeal, the bench added: 21. While closing on the matter, we deem it appropriate to reiterate what was expounded in the case of Nagaraja Rao (supra), that it is legally obligatory upon the Court of first instance, while awarding multiple punishments of imprisonment, to specify in clear terms as to whether the sentences would run concurrently or consecutively. It needs hardly an  emphasis that any omission to carry out this obligation by the Court of first instance causes unnecessary and avoidable prejudice to the parties, be it the accused or be it the prosecution.    Read Judgment    
The Karnataka High Court has said that if a wife is directed to pay maintenance to an able bodied husband who does not suffer from any disability or infirmity, it would be promoting idleness.  A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna made it clear that “Merely because Section 24 of (Hindu Marriage) Act is gender neutral for grant of maintenance, it would be promoting idleness notwithstanding the fact that the husband has no impediment or handicap to earn.”  The bench made the observation while upholding an order passed by the family court, granting maintenance of Rs 10,000 and litigation expense of Rs 25,000 to the wife and rejecting the application made by the husband seeking monthly maintenance of Rs.2,00,000 and litigation expenses at Rs.30,000, from the wife.  The primary contention of the husband was that he has become unemployed on the onset of Covid-19 and for the last two years he is not able to find a job and, therefore, no maintenance should be awarded to the wife, but in turn it should be awarded to him, from the hands of the wife.  Further, it was claimed that the parents of the wife are well off and that the wife has instituted several proceedings against the husband and his family members thus he has to meet those litigation expenses.  The bench considering the records observed “The contention that the petitioner has no job and has no means to maintain himself and, therefore, is not in a position to maintain the wife and in turn wants maintenance from the wife, is unacceptable as it is fundamentally flawed.”  Following which it held “Merely because he has lost his job on the onset of Covid19, it cannot be held that he is incapable of earning. Therefore, it can be irrefutably concluded that the husband by his own conduct has decided to lead a leisurely life by seeking maintenance from the hands of the wife.”  It added “In the considered view of this Court, such an application cannot be granted, as the husband cannot afford to incapacitate himself and sustain an application under Section 24 of the Act to claim maintenance from the hands of the husband. This would be an anathema to the spirit of Section 24 of the Act. Therefore, the husband cannot seek any maintenance unless he would demonstrate such a disability either physical or mental which incapacitates him from earning money by finding a job for himself.”  Noting that it is the duty of an able bodied husband to maintain himself, the wife and the child, if any, the bench opined “‘It is better to wear out, than rust out.”  Accordingly it dismissed the petition.

The Gujarat High Court has held that it is not necessary under Section 13(1)(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging Houses Rates Control Act, 1947 that all joint tenants must find alternative accommodation so that landlord can recover possession of rented premises.Justice AS Supehia observed,"The landlord shall be entitled to recover possession of any premises if the Court is... The Gujarat High Court has held that it is not necessary under Section 13(1)(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging Houses Rates Control Act, 1947 that all joint tenants must find alternative accommodation so that landlord can recover possession of rented premises. Justice AS Supehia observed, "The landlord shall be entitled to recover possession of any premises if the Court is satisfied that the tenant, after coming into operation of this Act, has built or acquired vacant possession of or been allotted a suitable residence and an eviction petition against one of the joint tenant is sufficient against all the joint tenants and all joint tenants are bound by the order of the Rent Controller as joint tenancy is one tenancy and is not a tenancy split into different legal heirs. If these persons become tenants in common or joint tenants, it is not the requirement of the law that all the tenants should have built accommodation for their residence." The Plaintiffs/Respondents (landlords) had sought the peaceful possession of the suit property and mesne profits from the Defendants (tenants). The trial court decreed in favour of the Plaintiffs and directed and the possession of suit property to be handed over to them. Aggrieved with the same, an appeal was filed with the Appellate bench of Small Causes Court which affirmed the decision of the trial court.  In the instant revisional application, the Defendants contested that there was no evidence they had acquired a suitable alternative accommodation. The decree of eviction could only be issued when the Plaintiffs were able to prove and establish that all tenants had alternative suitable accommodation. Further, the issue whether the other defendants were also joint tenants was not addressed.  Per contra, the Plaintiffs/Respondents submitted that this Court could not exercise its discretion u/s 29(2) of the Act due to limited scope. The suit is decreed in favour of Plaintiffs u/s 13(1)(1) of the Rent Act by the trial court on the ground that the Defendants had found a suitable residence for themselves, as well. Additionally, Defendants No. 1 and 3 were residing in the premises purchased by them while the remaining were not joint tenants. Hence, the trial court had not framed an issue in this regard.  Perusing these contentions, the High Court identified that the primary issue worth consideration was whether the Defendants/Applicants could be evicted as u/s 13(1)(1) of the Rent Act on the ground that the other tenants had acquired alternative accommodation.  Answering this question in the affirmative, the High Court observed  "Defendant no.1 is residing in the property purchased in his wife's name and defendant no.3 has purchased the property in his own name. Defendant no.5 is residing with his wife in a flat. Neither the defendants no.2 and 4 nor the other defendants have adduced any evidence that they could not have been accommodated in the alternative accommodations."  Accordingly, the High Court declined to interfere with the orders of the trial court and the Appellate Court.

"Every lawyer, who appears for his client, has a right of fair hearing, irrespective of who the complainant is," the Delhi High Court has recently observed recently. Justice Talwant Singh was dealing with a plea filed by seven accused persons seeking anticipatory bail directly in the High Court after claiming that since the complainant was an advocate, a fair hearing before the District Court was not possible because their counsels may be heckled during arguments.  However, the complainant, who was present in the court, assured the Bench that no such thing would happen. Thus, the Court was of the view: "In any case, learned Principal District & Sessions Judge, New Delhi District, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi is requested to ensure that no such incident happen as and when the applicants approach the District Court for anticipatory bail." "Every lawyer, who appears for his client, has a right of fair hearing, irrespective of who the complainant is." The Court directed that a copy of the order be sent to Principal District and Sessions Judge of the Patiala House Courts. "At the request of the learned counsel for the applicants, let they be allowed to withdraw the bail applications with liberty to approach the district court for filing fresh applications for anticipatory bail," the Court said.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that considering the testimony of witnesses if one accused is acquitted, no criminal proceeding can be sustained against co-accused on the same set of witnesses with the same allegation/case. The Bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Gupta observed thus as it quashed Section 364-A [Kidnapping for ransom] r/w Section 34 IPC charges against one Anant Mishra while taking into account the fact that on the basis of the testimony of same set of prosecution witnesses, the main accused in the matter were already acquitted by the court below. Significantly, to arrive at this conclusion, the Court relied upon Allahabad HC's ruling in the case of Diwan Singh Vs. State 1964 Lawsuit (All) 182, wherein it was held that if the allegation and witnesses are same and after examination of witnesses one accused is acquitted, then under such circumstances, the conviction of co-accused cannot be sustained. The case in brief  Opposite party no. 2 - Matadeen lodged an FIR in October 2016 against the unknown persons under Section 364-A IPC with the allegation that some unknown accused abducted his brother Sikander.  During the investigation, the name of five persons, including the present applicant came to light, thereafter, the police submitted a charge sheet against 3 of the accused. The trial against these persons took place before the Additional District Judge, Sultanpur. During the trial, three witnesses were examined by the prosecution. PW-1 Matadeen, who is the first informant and the brother of the abductee, did not support the prosecution case. PW-2 Monu alias Dilip Kumar, the niece of the abductee, clearly stated that no one had called him on his mobile phone for the ransom of Rs.25,00,000/- and he also did not support the prosecution case. PW-3 is the abductee Sikander, who also did not support the prosecution case. In view of this, all the three accused persons were exonerated of the charges leveled against them under Section 364-A IPC and they were acquitted by on September 28, 2018.  However, on December 24, 2018, in this very matter, the police submitted a charegseheet against the petitioner and he was summoned by the Chief Judicial Magistrate vide order dated. Jan 18, 2019. Challenging the charge sheet and the summoning order, the petitioner moved to the High Court. Court's observations  Taking into account the facts of the case and the ruling of the HC in the Diwan Singh (supra) case, the Court observed thus: "...considering the testimony of witnesses, if one accused is acquitted, no criminal proceeding can be sustained against co- accused on the same set of witnesses and in the present case too, there is no separate witness and on the basis of the testimony of same prosecution witnesses, main accused was acquitted by the court below, Whenever there is no prospect of the case ending in conviction, valuable time of court should not be wasted for holding trial only for the purpose of completing the procedure to pronounce the conclusion on future date. Therefore, the criminal proceeding cannot be permitted to continue against the applicant." Therefore, under such facts and circumstances of the case, the Court held that the criminal proceeding against the applicant under Section 364-A/34 IPC cannot be sustained and the same was thereby quashed.

The Supreme Court has observed in a judgment that revenue record is not a document of title. The Court added that a lessee would not be entitled to any right on the land only on the basis of an entry in the revenue record.  The bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian was hearing an appeal against the High Court's order wherein the Court had set aside the order dated July 8, 2004, passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Lucknow, wherein, the revenue entry of Khasra Nos. 1576 and 1738 was ordered to be corrected in the name of Department of Forest and the claim of rival claimants were set aside. The claimants had asserted rights over the forest land on the basis of entries in the revenue record. The Court rejected such claim observing as follows in the case Prabhagiya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag V. Arun Kumar Bhardwaj (Dead) Thr. Lrs.   *The revenue record is not a document of title. Therefore, even if the name of the lessee finds mention in the revenue record but such entry without any supporting documents of creation of lease contemplated under the Forest Act is inconsequential and does not create any right, title or interest over 12 bighas of land claimed to be in possession of the lessee as a lessee of the Gaon Sabha".  Factual Background   The Governor in the exercise of powers under Section 117 of the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 had issued a notification on October 11, 1952, under Section 4 of the Act as per which 162 acres of area in Village Kasmandi Khurd was not to vest with the Gaon Samaj.  On November 23, 1955 a notification was issued u/s 4 of the Forest Act, 1927 for inviting objections in respect of the land that formed a part of the notification and pursuant to this a proclamation was carried out on April 28, 1968 u/s 6 of the Forest Act, 1927.  The Gaon Sabha (local management committee) on May 15, 1966, and on December 26, 1966 put lessee into possession of 7 bighas and 5 bighas of land respectively from Khasra No 1576. The Forest Department challenged the grant of lease before the Sub Divisional Officer, Lucknow but remained unsuccessful vide order dated December 19, 1969. The Department however succeeded before the Additional Commissioner, Lucknow on July 22, 1970. Although the Board of Revenue dismissed the lessee's revision but on July 22, 1970, it decided to take a fresh decision after impleading the local management committee who had granted lease to the lessee on Goan Sabha's behalf.  When the six yearly Khatuni was prepared for the period 1380 fasli to 1388 fasli, the barren land which could be made cultivable including Khasra no. 1576 was recorded to be transferred name of Gaon Sabha village Kasmandi Khurd to Department of Forest. When the six yearly khatauni for the fasli year 1395 to 1400 was issued Khasra no. 1576 was transferred to the forest as a protected forest. Since the lessee's name appeared for the first time in khatauni prepared for the year 1407 fasli till 1412 fasli , for rectifying the revenue record from the lessee's name to that of the Forest Department, the Forest Department initiated proceedings under the Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1934 which were dismissed on July 22, 1993.  Pursuant to the dismissal of an appeal against the order dated July 22, 1993, the Deputy Director Consolidation in revision directed for correction of the revenue entry of Khasra Nos 1576 and 1738 in the name of Forest Department and set aside the claim of rival claimants.  The Allahabad High Court on November 30, 2005, set aside the order dated July 8, 2004, passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation.  Aggrieved, the Forest Department (Prabhagya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag) approached the Top Court.  Counsel's Submission  Relying on the notification dated October 11, 1952, counsel appearing for the Department, submitted that the notification had the effect of vesting all the rights, title and interest in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Relying on section 117 of the Abolition Act as per which the State could transfer the lands by a general or special order including forests to Gaon Sabha and other local authorities, the counsel contended that the land was not subject to any special or general orders and thus the land vested unequivocally with the State.  He further contended that the State could only issue a notification u/s 4 of the Forest Act, 1927 if it had proprietary rights over such land or if it was entitled to produce thereof.  It was also his contention that the lessees were not in possession of any part of the land at the time of issuance of such notification and they have not claimed rightly any right over the property and neither the Sabha claimed any right in the land measuring 162 acres notified in the notification.  Counsel(s) for the lessee's and Gaon Sabha submitted that the details of the land in respect of which the notification u/s 4 of the Forest Act was issued were not mentioned. It was also their contention that the notification u/s 4 was vague since it did not comply with the conditions and Khasra No 1576 was only mentioned in the proclamation published u/s 6 of the Forest Act.  Supreme Court's Observations   With regards to counsel for lessee's contention that the notification dated November 23, 1955 did not comply with the requirements u/s 4 of the Forest Act, the bench after relying on explanation 1 of Section 4 of the Forest Act observed that the notification had boundaries on all four sides mentioned.  "There is no other requirement under Section 4 of the Forest Act. It is only Section 6 of the Forest Act which needs to specify the situation and limits of the proposed forest. In terms of such clause (a) of Section 6 of the Forest Act, the details of khasra numbers which were part of 162 acres find mention in the proclamation so published," bench noted in its judgement authored by Justice Hemant Gupta while observing that the notification satisfied all the procedural requirements.  To deal with the counsel for lessee's contention with regards to publication of final notification u/s 20 of the Forest Act, 1927 the bench while referring to judgement in State of Uttarakhand and Ors v Kumaon Stone Crusher observed that,  "A reading of Section 20 of the Forest Act does not show that for a reserved forest, there is a requirement of publication of notification but no time limit is prescribed for publication of such notification under Section 20. Therefore, even if notification under Section 20 of the Forest Act has not been issued, by virtue of Section 5 of the Forest Act, there is a prohibition against acquisition of any right over the land comprised in such notification except by way of a contract executed in writing by or on behalf of the Government. Since no such written contract was executed by or on behalf of the State or on behalf of the person in whom such right was vested, therefore, the Gaon Sabha was not competent to grant lease in favour of the appellant."  The Top Court thereafter while observing that the findings of the High Court were clearly erroneous set aside the order and observed that the land vested in the Forest Department by virtue of notification published under the statute and that it was the lessee who had to assert the title on the forest land by virtue of an agreement in writing by a competent authority but no such agreement in writing was produced.

Lrs. | Civil Appeal No 7017 of 2009  Coram: Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice V Ramasubramanian  Related : Mutation Entry Does Not Confer Any Right, Title Or Interest In Favour Of Any Person: Supreme Court  Revenue Record Entries Do Not Confer Title To A Property, Reiterates SC [Read Judgment]     
The Delhi High Court has reiterated the position of law laid by the Apex Court that a Trial Court cannot qualify the imprisonment of life awarded by it to remainder of natural life.  A division bench comprising of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Mini Pushkarna observed thus while awarding life sentence (for remainder of life) to three men for gang rape and murder of a three year old minor child, observing that the same was done in a diabolic and brutal manner. The trial court had convicted the trio under sec. 376(2) and 302 of Indian Penal Code and had sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment for the remainder of their natural lives. While upholding their conviction, the Bench observed that as per Union of India v. V. Sriharan @ Murugan & Ors., power to impose a modified punishment providing for any specific term of incarceration or till the end of the convict's life as an alternate to death penalty can be exercised only by the High Court and the Supreme Court and not by any other inferior Court. Hence, the High Court was of the view that the impugned order on sentence to the extent it awards sentence for imprisonment of the remainder of the life to the appellants herein for offences punishable under Sections 376(2) and 302/34 IPC cannot be sustained. The question before the High Court was thus whether High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction can direct that the life imprisonment awarded by trial court would be for the remainder of the life or a definite term. The Court observed that though the Trial Court could not have qualified the imprisonment of life awarded by it to the remainder of the natural life of the convicts, the High Court though setting aside the said order in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, can award the same sentence on consideration of the facts of the case.  The Court reiterated the position laid down in the judgments of Supreme Court in Union of India v. V. Sriharan @ Murugan & Ors. wherein it was held that the power to impose a modified punishment providing for any specific term of incarceration or till the end of the convict's life as an alternate to death penalty can be exercised only by the High Court and the Supreme Court and not by any other inferior Court. The said position was reiterated in Gauri Shankar v. State of Punjab. Thus, it exercised its appellate jurisdiction by awarding life sentence under sec. 376(2) and 302 of Indian Penal Code. It observed that the imprisonment of life for the remainder of life would be an appropriate sentence in the facts of the case. Noting that death sentence was not awarded by the Trial Court, the Court observed that the sentence of life which would ordinarily be up to fourteen years after remissions would be highly inadequate, unjust and unfair to the victim. "In the present case, the three appellants have been convicted for the gang rape and murder of a minor aged 3 years, thereby brutally mutilating her private parts and smothering her," the Court said. Hence, it said that imprisonment of life for the remainder of life to the appellants would be an appropriate sentence in the facts of the case. Thus, upholding the conviction of the appellants, the Court ordered thus: "Consequently, upholding the conviction of the appellants for the offences punishable under Sections 376(2)(g) IPC, 302 IPC, 377 IPC and 201 IPC, and of appellant Jamahir for offence punishable under Section 363 IPC, though the order on sentence to the extent it directs the appellants to undergo imprisonment for the remainder of life as passed by the learned Trial Court is set aside for offences punishable under Sections 376(2) and 302 IPC, however, in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction and in view of diabolic and brutal manner in which rape with murder of a three year old child was committed, this Court deems it fit to award the same sentence i.e. remainder of the life for offences punishable under Sections 376(2) and 302 IPC. The sentence of simple imprisonment for 10 years for offence punishable under Section 377 IPC to all the appellants and imprisonment for 5 years to the appellant Jamahir for offence punishable under Section 363 IPC along with the fine imposed and the default sentences is upheld." The appeals were accordingly disposed of.  Case Title: JAMAHIR ALIAS JAWAHAR v. THE STATE GOVT OF NCT OF DELHI    
The Delhi High Court has observed that insistence of spousal consent for organ donation would impinge upon the right of the wife to be in control of her own body. Interpreting relevant provisions of Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules, 2014 as well as Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, Justice Yashwant Varma further added that a spouse cannot be recognised in law to have a superior or supervening right to control a personal and conscious decision of the donor. The Court was dealing with a plea filed by a married woman seeking to donate her kidney to her ailing father. The petitioner wife had alleged that although she was ready and willing to donate her organ to her ailing father, her application was not being processed since the respondent hospital was insisting on a submission of a No Objection Certificate from her husband. It was further alleged that the relationship between the petitioner and her husband were presently estranged and consequently it would not be practical or possible to obtain the same. The Court therefore observed that the insistence on spousal consent for organ donation would impinge upon the petitioner's right to be in control of her own body.  "That right which is personal and inalienable cannot be recognised as being subject to the consent of the spouse. A spouse, in any case, cannot be recognised in law to have a superior or supervening right to control a personal and conscious decision of the donor," the Court said.  However, the Court added that the aforesaid would necessarily be subject to the caveat of the competent authority duly ascertaining that the consent has been given freely and is an informed choice and decision of the donor. On a reading of Rule 18 of Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules, 2014, the Court opined that the statute did not contemplate or mandate spousal consent being obtained.  "At least such a stipulation does not stand expressly engrafted in the Rules. Rule 18 also does not envisage or mandate a No Objection Certificate being obtained from the spouse of the proposed donor. Rule 22, while prescribing that in case where a donor is a woman greater precaution ought to be exercised, also does not mandate a No Objection Certificate being obtained from the spouse. All that the said Rule requires is her independent consent being confirmed by a person other than the beneficiary," the Court said.  The Court added that all that the provision in the said Rules mandate is the facet of independent consent being verified and confirmed "by a person other than the beneficiary". The Court further noted the petitioner being a major, was clearly covered by sec. 2(f) of Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 which defines a donor to mean any person who voluntarily authorises the removal of his/her organ.  "The petitioner would also clearly fall in the ambit of Section 2(i) as a near relative by virtue of being the daughter of the beneficiary," it said.  The Court also relief on the Supreme Court decision in Common Cause v. Union of India & Anr. wherein while dealing with the issue of euthanasia, it was recognised the right of an individual over his/her own body and the same being inextricably connected to the right to life itself and the constitutional guarantee of dignified existence.  "In the considered opinion of this Court, the insistence on spousal consent being obtained is clearly ultra vires the provisions of the Act. In the absence of any statutorily ordained requirement of spousal consent being engrafted in the Act, the Court finds itself unable to countenance the objection taken by the respondent hospital," the Court said.  Accordingly, the plea was disposed of with a direction to the respondent hospital to process the application and request as made by the petitioner in accordance with law bearing in mind the statutory provisions contained in Rules 18 and 22.  "The application of the petitioner may be duly examined and placed before the competent authority of the hospital. The Court only observes that the aforesaid application shall not be denied solely on the ground that it is not accompanied with a No Objection Certificate of the spouse of the petitioner," the Court added.

The Gujarat High Court has recently dismissed a revision petition seeking reconsideration of application filed by Petitioner-Accused under Section 227 CrPC for discharge from a murder and assault case. The Bench comprising Justice Samir Dave noted that the charge and framing of charge have been deferred time and again due to several applications moved by the petitioner along with co-accused which ultimately prolonged the trial. It observed, "Present petition is nothing but a delaying tactic as the application seems to have been deferred on several occasions, whereas the co-accused seem to have been assassinating and languishing in the prison wherein the charge till date has not been framed or followed by the commencement of the trial due to several applications moved by the petitioner...The very purpose and the object of following the provisions of Sections 226 to 228 of the Cr.P.C. is to ensure the expeditious disposal of the Sessions Case so that the accused is discharged if there is not sufficient material against him or he can be tried quickly by following the due procedure laid down under Chapter-28 of the Cr.P.C."  The Court said that from the record that there is sufficient piece of evidence on the basis of which the guilt of the petitioner can be proved. It went on to observe that the standard of test and judgment which is to be finally applied before recording a finding regarding the guilt or otherwise of the accused is not exactly to be applied at the stage of deciding the matter under section 227 or section 228 of the Code. The Petitioner herein was accused of offences u/s 302, 307, 323, 324, 506(2), 504, 143, 144, 147, 148, 149, 120B and 34 of IPC and Section 135 of the Gujarat Police Act. The Prosecution claimed that a scuffle took place amongst the caste members of the Petitioner before the police in a meeting and therefore, several members had sustained injuries while two individuals passed away. The Petitioner was arrested and subsequently enlarged on bail.  The Petitioner's primary contention in the Revision Application before the Trial Court was that no procedure under Section 226 of CrPC was followed by the Prosecution. The Prosecution, per contra, averred that they had placed sufficient reliance on all documents. The Trial Court dismissed the Petitioner's application seeking discharge from the trial basis the documentary evidence.  The Petitioner challenged this order before the instant Bench on the ground that there was no material against him and he was only arraigned because of his presence at the scene. Under Sec 227 if there was no sufficient ground for proceeding against an Accused person, the person deserves a discharge. The APP, however, insisted that documentary material along with the charge-sheet showed that the Petitioner had committed the offence for which he was supposed to be tried.  Justice Dave noted that the Petitioner had frequently tried to move several applications to prolong the trial. Further, there was sufficient evidence regarding the Petitioner's statement and conduct to deserve a trial. Justice Dave referred to State of Bihar Vs. Ramesh Singh to reiterate:  "If the scales of pan as to the guilt or innocence of the accused are something like even at the conclusion of the, trial, then, on the theory of benefit of doubt the case is to end in his acquittal. But, if, on the other hand, it is so at the initial stage of making an order under section 227 or section 228, then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under section 228 (framing of charge) and not under section 227."  The High Court relied on State of Maharashtra Vs. Som Nath Thapa to emphasise the definition of 'presume' and concluded that if the Court comes to the conclusion that the commission of the offence is probable, then framing of charges is required.  Keeping in view these decisions, the High Court found that the Trial Court's decision did not suffer from illegality and was entitled to be upheld.

The Kerala High Court has accentuated on the fact that police officers must comply with the relevant statutory provisions/guidelines making it mandatory to wear the uniform while on duty except when it is permissible under law to deviate from the said mandatory requirement.Justice Mohammed Nias C.P while quashing proceedings against a man for questioning an officer in plain clothes,... The Kerala High Court has accentuated on the fact that police officers must comply with the relevant statutory provisions/guidelines making it mandatory to wear the uniform while on duty except when it is permissible under law to deviate from the said mandatory requirement. Justice Mohammed Nias C.P while quashing proceedings against a man for questioning an officer in plain clothes, reiterated that the requirement of the police officer to wear the uniform while on duty is to be enforced without exception. The Court was hearing a plea filed by an advocate seeking to quash a final report filed against him for constructing and assaulting a police officer discharging his duty.  The allegation in the report was that the petitioner shoved and abused a police officer on traffic duty who was seen pasting a sticker on his car parked near a 'No Parking' sign.  However, the petitioner argued that the Civil Police Officer was not in his uniform, so he was not aware that it was an officer. Accordingly, seeing a man in plain clothes pasting a sticker on his car, the petitioner bonfaidely questioned the authority of the person.  The Court found that since the police officer was not in his uniform while being on official duty, there was no question of the petitioner knowing that he was a police officer, and hence intention to obstruct his duties can not be established.  In that context, it was held that no offence was committed by the petitioner and noting that the petitioner had remitted the fine imposed for parking his car in a no parking zone, the Court found that no further penalty was warranted in the matter.   Accordingly, the final report lodged against the petitioner was quashed by the Court.  Nevertheless, before parting with the case, the court emphasised on the necessity of the police force to wear the uniform while on duty with reference to the relevant statutory provisions. "The uniform of a policeman is his direct identification. A policeman in uniform is visible and a citizen immediately knows that he is a policeman which will inform that the said individual is in charge of his protection and prevention of offences. It carries an undeniable symbolic value besides representing the State authority. The police uniform also symbolises pride, respect and authority over the citizens." It was added that Sections 43 and 44 of the Kerala Police Act not only deals with the distinctive, exclusive and easily identifiable nature of the uniform or the vehicles used by the police but also states why it is so required.  The Single Judge opined that it 'points to the importance of wearing uniform so as to make the police identifiable and in deference to the Kerala Police Act, Police Manual and Police Uniform Regulations.'  It was further held that since police officers takes pride in their uniform and the visibility of a police officer is very critical for the police and the society, the requirement of wearing the same while on duty except where deviations are permissible shall be scrupulously observed.  As such, the State Police Chief was directed to look into the matter and issue appropriate directions to ensure that the police officers comply with the relevant statutory provisions/guidelines making it mandatory to wear the uniform while on duty except when it is permissible under law to deviate from the said mandatory requirement.  Advocate Arun Kumar P. appeared for the petitioner and Public Prosecutor Maya M.N for the respondent.  Case Title: Avinash v. State of Kerala  
The Karnataka High Court has imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh each on two dental colleges for having wasted the court's time by filing "speculative" petitions seeking relief on behalf of few students who did not get admission to BDS courses, for the year 2021-2022.  A division bench of Justice B Veerappa and Justice K.S.Hemalekha directed Venkateshwara Dental College and Hospital and KVG Dental College & Hospital to deposit the cost amount with the Advocates' Association of Bengaluru within a period of one month.  The colleges along with few students desirous of getting admission to BDS courses had approached the court claiming that the website/portal of the Karnataka Examination Authority, which facilitates the registration to the course, was not at all open due to the reasons best known to them and therefore, petitioner-students could not register themselves in terms of the schedule announced by the Medical Counselling Committee for Mop-up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021.  Therefore, the petitioner No.1-institutions addressed a letter to KEA, requesting the authority to permit the petitioner-students to register and facilitate their admission.  However, since the Authority did not make their website/ portal available for the petitioner students to register on 2nd and 3rd of May for Mop-up round 2 counselling for BDS 2021, they could not register and get the admission to the Dental course. Therefore, the petitioner No.1- institutions and the petitioner-students approached the court.  Findings:  At the outset, the bench noted that the petitioners have not made out any statutorily enforceable right to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus and thus, they are not entitled to any relief under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.  Referring to the statement of objections filed by KEA, wherein it had specifically contended that for the Academic Year 2021-22 the website/portal was open for online registration process by the eligible NEET qualified students and was extended several times, the bench observed, "The petitioners have not denied the specific averments made at paragraph-4 of the statement of objections specifying the dates on which the online registration process was open for the eligible candidates to register with the Karnataka Examination Authority nor produced any contra documents to the effect that the Karnataka State e-Information Bulletin containing the calendar of events issued is not meant for registration to BDS course for the year 2021."  Rejecting the contention of the colleges that it approached the authority requesting to open the portal for registration the bench said, "Petitioners No.1-colleges being the Management, are not the aggrieved parties to address letter to the respondent No.3 praying to open the website/portal. It is only the students who can seek such prayer, if they are so aggrieved. Only the students who are qualified in NEET can approach the respondent No.3. The representation made by the college has no consequence."  Noting that in the cause title of the petition the address of the students is mentioned to be the address of the college, the bench expressed, "We are bowled over as to how the students come under the 'care of' the college of which they are not the students at all. This clearly indicates, only with an intention to fill up the vacant seats, the petitioner No.1-colleges have adopted the indirect method of getting an order from the Court and therefore, have not approached the Court with clean hands."  It added that if the petitioner-students were really deprived of the seats to which they were eligible, they would have approached the Court, independently, by producing the documents showing the illegality committed by the respondents. However, that was not the case. "The colleges cannot step into the shoes of students and file the writ petitions."  It held that a writ of mandamus sought by the petitioners No.1- colleges on behalf of the students who are not admitted into the college is not maintainable. "Filing and contesting these types of litigation is nothing but wasting precious public time and that of this Court and is nothing but harassing the respondent-authorities unnecessarily, by driving them to the Court and making them spend litigation expenses etc."  Trend of Speculative litigation on the rise  The bench observed that because of petitioners No.1-college, the petitioner-students approached the Court believing that they will obtain relief and they will get admission in the college. Thereby, the precious time of the petitioner-students was wasted, so also that of the Court, depriving other genuine litigants.  It then opined, "The experience of this Court is that in recent years there has emerged a trend of filing speculative litigations before various Courts of law, not just in the Court of first instance, but also in the High Court as well as before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is the duty of the Courts to ensure that such litigations shall be weeded out at the first instance rather than allowing to be festered and thereby coming in the way of genuine litigants seeking justice treating the Court as "Temple of Justice" and to protect precious public & judicial time of the court."

In a recent dispute where a Central Government entity moved Punjab and Haryana High Court against Haryana Government through a writ, the High Court expressed its worries on the matter not reflecting well on the federal arrangement and ordered for constitution of a High Powered Committee to deal with their disputes.  "In a welfare State it does not augur well on the part of one Government to be in lis with another Government, by invoking provisions of Article 226 of Constitution of India. It goes against the very grain of Westminster module of governance," said the Court.   The matter goes back to 2010, when the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), a Government of India Enterprise, had made acquisitions of lands of persons in Haryana. Monetary Compensation was paid to the oustees, however, the Haryana Government passed an order, directing NPCIL to additionally provide jobs to oustees under the Haryana State Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2010.  NPCIL approached the High Court praying for the quashing of this order, stating that their obligation was limited to paying monetary compensation against the land acquired by them.   NPCIL maintained that the provision of providing employment to the land oustees under the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2010 was not applicable to it, nor was an undertaking to that effect made by NPCIL. They argued that given the specialized nature of work which NPCIL undertakes, NPCIL had its own norms of employing human resource dependant very much on the expertise of the person.   The single bench of Justice Arun Monga noted how it was ultimately the oustees who were impacted due to the tussle between the two Governments. The Court said:  "Due to sheer callousness, if one may call it, of tossing the responsibility back and forth between Centre and State, the oustees have been left high and dry qua the reciprocal assurances given to them, while acquiring their land. No doubt, one time compensation has though been paid to them, but rest of the benefits, including that of providing job to one family member of each oustee land owner, remain unfulfilled, though the land was acquired way back 10-12 years ago."  "Livelihood is integral part of right to live and life, and is thus a fundamental right envisaged under Article 21 of Constitution of India. Compensation remains a poor substitute of loss of livelihood. As already stated, it does not reflect well on a Welfare State to indulge in such harsh and capricious practice to deprive fundamental rights of a citizen," added the High Court while noting the plight of the tussle on the oustees.   In an attempt to ensure that there is a body to resolve disputes of similar nature, Justice Monga ordered the constitution of a Committee to look into the rehabilitation policy and to also resolve subsequent disputes between NPCIL and Haryana Government that may arise. The Court said:  "Secretary, Ministry of Power and New & Renewable Energy, GOI is directed to constitute a High Powered Committee (HPC) headed and chaired by him, with Additional Chief Secretary to Haryana Government, Power Department, MD of NPCIL, MD of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited as its necessary constituents. The Secretary to GOI shall be at liberty to include a fifth member of his choice."  Explaining the functions of the Committee, the Court said:  "The HPC shall look into the inter se disputes between NPCIL vis-à-vis Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited. It shall also formulate the issues to be resolved in seriatim. After holding threadbare discussions and going through the relevant record, it shall also give a conclusive report as to which R&R policy is applicable and who is to be held responsible for implementation thereof. Committee's report/opinion, needless to say, shall be binding on both Government of India as well as State Government."  Noting that the landowners have already been waiting for 10-12 years expecting that a person from their family shall get job, the Court directed that the HPC shall decide and appropriate responsibility on who is to offer such employment within the next six months.

"'Even a protector needs protection and safety' and its time that Government must take effective measures and steps ensure good health and safety of the Police personnel's"  Former Assistant Commissioner of Police, Mr. Bhanupratap Barge has moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Central Government to make provisions for payment of 'risk and hardship' allowance to the police officers who are serving on the frontline amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Petitioner, through Advocate Pai Amit, has submitted that the concept of "Risk and Hardship Allowance" is not a novel one and should be put to use to aid the Police officers who are working over-time in hazardous conditions for enforcing the lockdown.     Petitioner has also sought that the circulars whereby several state governments have announced to deduct the salaries of the police personnel should be withdrawn forthwith.  The plea states that working at the frontline has made police officers and their families more vulnerable to contracting COVID 19. In fact, it submitted that there have been various reports of the police personnel who are contracting COVID 19 and several officers have even died in Madhya Pradesh.  "It is submitted that by the very nature of their work, not only are police G personnel but also their respective families are at risk of contracting COVID 19. The police personnel are also coming under tremendous stress and no steps are taken for their mental well being. The present petition is being filed to ensure that the morale of the police personnel is boosted with incentives, especially due to the current COVID 19 situation," the Petitioner submitted.  The Petitioner bats for incentives for police officers in the form of bonuses and additional salary, so as to boost their morale and enable them to support their families, especially in those areas that have been declared containment areas/ hotspots.  He submitted that the Government is obligated to protect the rights of the police personnel under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. "The Respondents have also a duty to, not only provide incentives to the police personnel, but also to ensure that they are incentivised for the additional duty of ensuring the proper implementation of the lockdown," he remarked.  In addition to this, the Petitioner has sought that the police personnel who are above the age of 48 years and suffer from any sort of medical conditions should be not deployed in hazardous working environment, due to their being more vulnerable to the infection.  "As per WHO guidelines older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 hence such officer above 48 years with above medical conditions be not deployed in any stressful working environment which comes in direct contact with COVID-19 patients.  It is submitted that as per the reports published in various news paper the officials who have died are above 50 years of age. The Petitioner in this regard seeks urgent interim directions to State to identify such police officials and exempt them from COVID-19 related duties and be put on any administrative work which has no or limited exertion," the Petitioner submitted.  Further, to address the serious shortage of police personnel and the fact that police personnel are also contracting COVID 19, the Petitioner has submitted that it is quintessential for the Government to recruit a few persons on ad hoc basis, to man the law and order situation.  "The present petition is being filed seeking further direction to all the State Governments to, on ad hoc basis recruit persons who are physically fit, to ensure that the police officials are not burdened," the plea states.  Inter alia, the plea has sought apposite directions to the Government to ensure adequate supply of protective gears such as masks, gloves and sanitizers for police personnel's, at priority.  Lastly, the Petitioner has sought that the circulars whereby several state governments have announced to deduct the salaries of the police personnel should be withdrawn forthwith.  "Although some State viz State of Haryana and State of Telangana have sought to encourage and appreciate the efforts of the Police personnel's by paying them double salary, at the same time other States have, infact, in a way penalised the officers by deducting E their salaries upto 25% to 35% which is detriment to the interest and moral of several officers who are on field trying to contain this deadly virus which has taken several lives across the Globe," the Petitioner submitted.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday transferred to CBI the investigation into alleged killing of an undertrial prisoner by jail officers inside the Tihar Jail, after observing that an in depth investigation into the matter is required to be conducted.Justice Mukta Gupta took note of the fact that there was no investigation made into the claim made by deceased's sister that he had made a phone call... The Delhi High Court on Tuesday transferred to CBI the investigation into alleged killing of an undertrial prisoner by jail officers inside the Tihar Jail, after observing that an in depth investigation into the matter is required to be conducted. Justice Mukta Gupta took note of the fact that there was no investigation made into the claim made by deceased's sister that he had made a phone call to her a day prior to his death expressing apprehension that he would be killed. "Considering the fact that as per status report filed by the Superintendent Jail, there was no apparent injury on the deceased, however, the case of the petitioner is that there were deep injury marks on the deceased and an indepth investigation is required to be conducted to find out the circumstances under which the deceased made a phone call to his sister expressing his apprehension of death and his subsequent death in the judicial custody, this Court finds it fit to transfer the investigation of the case FIR in question to CBI," the Court ordered. The petition was moved by mother of the deceased seeking CBI investigation and also preservation of CCTV footages of the relevant time of death. The deceased was in judicial custody since June 13, 2019 lodged in the Tihar Jail. He was declared dead on 14th May 2021 after he was taken to Safdarjung Hospital. An FIR was therefore registered under Section 302 and 34 of IPC. As per the report submitted on behalf of Jail Superintendent, it was stated that four undertrial Prisoners were beating the deceased with a cricket bat, as a result of which one of the inmates and deceased sustained injuries. The deceased was thereafter taken to the jail dispensary and was referred to Safdarjung Hospital for treatment wherein he was declared as dead. It was the case of the petitioner that by looking at the photos and videos of the deceased body, it could be seen that deep cut wounds on his thighs and hands could not have been caused by bat injuries and only could've inflicted from some sharp object. On the aspect of CCTV footages, it was submitted on behalf of Director General of Prions that old CCTVs installed inside Tihar Jail had become non-functional and thus, a mega plan of installation of the CCTVs is presently underway and that they had been installed at most of the places. It was also submitted that out of 6967 CCTVs to be installed, more than half of the CCTVs installed were functional and rest would be made functional by 15th August 2021. "It is thus evident that no CCTV footage of the incident is available. However, the prime issue which now concerns this Court besides the manner in which the death of the inmate has been caused, is, why no proper investigation could be carried out despite the fact that a PCR call was made from a phone number from the jail and the said phone number is duly recorded in the PCR Call," the Court observed. While directing transfer of investigation to CBI, the Court sought a status report to be filed before the next date of hearing. The matter will now be heard on September 29. Title: MALIKA v. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI & ORS.   
The Supreme Court observed that the failure of the accused to explain can only be held as an additional link to complete the chain of circumstance. If the other circumstances in the chain are not established, such failure to explain cannot be the sole basis to convict the accused, the bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna observed.Section 106 of the Evidence Act provides... The Supreme Court observed that the failure of the accused to explain can only be held as an additional link to complete the chain of circumstance.  If the other circumstances in the chain are not established, such failure to explain cannot be the sole basis to convict the accused, the bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna observed. Section 106 of the Evidence Act provides that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. In this case the High Court held the accused guilty of pouring kerosene around the deceased and her children and setting them on fire since he had failed to explain the reason for eruption of fire in the house. The case of the prosecution in this case was that the accused was married to the husband of the deceased (who was his first wife and had two kids). Due to incident of fire occurred in the house, the first wife and kids died. The Husband, mother in law and the accused were tried and the Trial Court convicted the accused only. This is after noticing that the accused was also sleeping along with the deceased and in that circumstance was of the opinion that if the house caught fire accidentally then the accused also should have suffered burn injuries. Since she had come out of the house without any injuries it was held that she is guilty. The High Court confirmed the Trial Court judgment. In appeal, the bench observed that the links in the chain of circumstances is necessary to be established for conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence. It said that mere suspicion would not be sufficient, unless the circumstantial evidence tendered by the prosecution leads to the conclusion that it "must be true" and not "may be true". Referring to evidence on record, the bench made the following observations:  Moral wrong for not coming to the aid of deceased cannot be a circumstance to hold a person guilty of a crime which is as serious as murder "The natural human conduct is that when there is any incident or accident the immediate reaction is to get away from the scene and save oneself. If in the middle of the night for whatever reason there was fire and if the appellant had woken up and noticed it a little earlier, the natural conduct is to run out of the house instead of going into the house which is burning to check on the other inmates. It takes a person lot of courage or be overdriven with compassion to get back into the house to save somebody else and not doing so may be considered as morally wrong for not coming to the aid of fellow human being in distress, but it cannot be a circumstance to hold a person guilty of a crime which is as serious as murder unless the other circumstances in the chain point to the accused so as to lead to an irresistible conclusion of being guilt" The court added that not being injured alone cannot be held as a circumstance to hold one guilty of having set fire to the house.  In this case, the High Court had held the second marriage; the desire for domestic dominance and the execution of document for maintenance on 17.02.2006, that is, a day before registration of the marriage as a circumstance and motive,. In this regard, the bench observed: "This is for the reason that the marriage had been registered after an arrangement for maintenance was made in favour of the first wife for only a portion of the property which is a normal thing in such circumstance and it cannot be held as a strong motive for an alleged crime of the present nature where the appellant would destroy her own house and that too without there being any other incident when they have lived together in the same house and the fire incident has occurred after more than six months from the date of marriage.. Therefore, if all these aspects are taken into consideration the doubts which arise in the mind would outweigh the reasons given by the High Court for pointing to the suspicion on the appellant and in that circumstance certainly the benefit of doubt should go in favour of the appellant. Failure to explain can only be held as an additional link to complete the chain of circumstance The High Court had held the accused  guilty of pouring kerosene around the deceased and her children and setting them on fire since the appellant had failed to explain the reason for eruption of fire in view of such obligation to explain under Section 106. In this context, it was observed thus: "As held in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra) the failure to explain can only be held as an additional link to complete the chain of circumstance. In the instant case, since the other circumstances in the chain are not established, the same cannot be held against the appellant. On the other hand, the case itself is that the fire had erupted at midnight when the appellant and others were sleeping and she come out shouting. The explanation for the cause of fire by the appellant would have arisen only if there was any other evidence to the effect that the appellant was already awake and was outside even before the fire erupted." Therefore, allowing the appeal, the bench observed that the accused is entitled to be acquitted as the benefit of doubt weighs in her favour.        
The Himachal Pradesh High Court on Wednesday observed that courts while exercising power under Section 147 (Offences To Be Compoundable) of the Negotiable Instrument Act are sufficiently empowered to proceed to compound an offence, even in cases where accused stands convicted. The observations were made by Justice Sandeep Sharma while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner/accused had prayed for compounding of the offence under S.147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act on the ground that the petitioner/accused had compromised the matter with the respondent and paid the entire due amount.  On account of the settlement arrived, the accused had approached the court under S.482 CrPC, praying therein for compounding of the offence under Section 147 of the Act.  The Non-applicant on his part fairly stated that since entire amount of compensation has been deposited by the accused, he has no objection in case prayer of the accused for compounding of the offence and thereafter his acquittal is accepted.  After anxiously examining the record the bench noted that the petitioner/accused had already been held guilty of having committed offence punishable under S.138 of the Act and convicted and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay compensation to the tune of Rs.1.20 Lakh to the complainant.  Bench also noted that the Petitioner/Accused had filed an appeal but the same was also dismissed, after which he approached the High Court court under Ss. 397 and 401 CrPC by way of Cr. Revision, but the same was also dismissed on merit.  The moot question that fell for adjudication was as to whether after upholding the judgments of conviction and order of sentence passed by courts below, High Court could proceed to compound the offence or not? Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Sharma observed that the court can proceed to compound the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act, after recording of conviction and sentence. Relying on the apex court judgment in Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H. (2010), the bench said that notwithstanding the fact that a judgment of conviction and order of sentence recorded by trial Court has been further upheld by this Court but Section 147 of the Act sufficiently empowers this Court to compound the offence after recording of conviction and hence there appears to be no impediment in accepting the prayer made in the application. Highlighting the compromise arrived by the parties in the matter, Justice Sharma observed that the respondent is no more interested in sending the petitioner/accused behind the bars in terms of judgment of conviction and order of sentence recorded by the Court below.  Accordingly the bench recalled the order passed earlier by it in Cr. Revision and ordered the matter to be compounded inter se parties. Impugned judgments of conviction and order of sentence passed by both the Courts below was quashed and set aside.  Case Title: Naresh Kumar Vs Trilok Chand.   
The Allahabad High Court recently observed that a wife doesn't lose her opportunity for grant of maintenance under Section 125 CrPC on the ground that she has sufficient means to maintain herself and her children as she got money after selling the property. With this, the Bench of Justice Brij Raj Singh set aside the judgment and order passed by the family court rejecting the plea of one Krishna Devi under Section 125 Cr.P.C. seeking direction to her husband to pay her at least Rs.10,000/- as the monthly maintenance. Krishna Devi (wife/revisionist) filed an application under Section 125 CrPC before the Family Court Lucknow stating that she got married to the opposite party no.2 (Husband) in 1967 and out of the wedlock three children were born.  She further stated that her husband provided maintenance to her till 1983, but thereafter it was stopped by him. She further stated in the application that she was dependent on her brother, who used to provide financial assistance but suddenly, he had gone missing. Therefore, she sought maintenance from her husband on the ground that she has no source of income at the relevant time. However, her application was rejected on the following ground:- The revisionist did not submit as to why she was living separatelyThe property at Farrukhabad was sold by he and she received money after selling the property which indicates that she has sufficient means. The revisionist was unable to state as to whether her children were literate or illiterate or how much they were educated, therefore, some adverse inferences were drawn by the court. All the three children were settled by her; thus she was having means to sustain. The Husband stated the fact that the revisionist had illicit relation with a person and the said fact was not denied by her The observations made by the High Court The Court noted that the Court did not take into account the fact that since her husband had performed a second marriage, and she was deserted, therefore, she was living separately. Regarding the money received after selling the property, the Court observed thus: "The finding recorded by the court below appears to be perverse because if there was some property at Farrukhabad and money out of sold property was used for maintenance of the children as well as revisionist; it could not be inferred that the revisionist has lost her opportunity for grant of maintenance under Section 125 CrPC...If some income was received by her out of the sold property, it does not mean that she would sustain throughout life." Regarding the claim made by the Husband and recorded by the Court that the revisionist had an illicit relationship, the Court stressed that the said finding was also perverse because the statement of fact was not proved. Further, referring to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Rajnesh v. Neha and another, (2021) 2 SCC 324, the Court noted that the status of the husband and wife should be looked into while granting maintenance and even if the wife is working and has got some means of income, she is entitled to maintenance as per the status of the husband. "The court below has passed the order without appreciating the facts in totality. The observation appears to be influenced by factual aspects which were not proved and without adducing them on record. The application has been rejected without application of mind. Since the income part and other relevant evidence have not been looked into, it is not appropriate to arrive at any conclusion at the moment for granting maintenance because quantum can be assessed only after recording the finding on financial assets and income of the husband," the Court noted as it set aside its judgment and order. Consequently, the Court remanded the case to the court below to take a fresh decision within a period of four weeks. Case title - Smt. Krishna Devi v. State of U.P. and Another [CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 205 of 2016]    
The Karnataka High Court has quashed a cheating case registered against a 61-year-old man who is alleged to have fraudulently obtained a false Caste Certificate, stating that he belongs to Scheduled Caste on which basis he secured a job in BEML.  A single judge bench of Justice Hemant Chandangoudar allowed the petition filed by S. Neelakantappa, saying “The Caste Certificate issued in favour of the petitioner having not been cancelled under the provision of the Rules, (Karnataka Schedule Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes (Reservation of Appointment etc.) Rules 1992, cognizance taken by the learned Magistrate on the basis of the final report is impermissible.”  Further the bench made it clear that “The learned Magistrate cannot adjudicate the validity of the Caste Certificate and its only the Caste Verification Committee under Rules 1992, can adjudicate whether the petitioner has obtained the Caste Certificate fraudulently that he belongs to Machala Community though he belongs to Weavers Community which is not a Scheduled Caste Community.”  It was alleged that though the petitioner belongs to Weavers Community by furnishing false information with the Tahsildar, Bellary Taluk, obtained Caste Certificate that he belongs to Machala Community which is classified as Scheduled Caste.  On the magistrate taking cognizance of the offence, the accused filed a discharge application which came to be rejected. In its order of rejection the magistrate said whether the petitioner belongs to Weavers Community or Machala Community is the matter which requires to be considered after full fledged trial. In appeal the sessions court also upheld the magistrate court order. Following which the petitioner approached the high court.  The petitioner argued that in the absence of any enquiry conducted by the Caste Verification Committee as specified under Rule 6A and 7(4) of the Karnataka Schedule Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes (Reservation of Appointment etc.) Rules, 1992, the Police have no jurisdiction to register FIR for the offence punishable under Section 420 of IPC alleging that the petitioner-accused obtained caste certificate by furnishing false information.  The bench noted that the Caste Certificate issued in favour of the petitioner-accused that he belongs to Machala community is still in subsistence and is not cancelled by the Competent Authority under the Rules, 1992.  Referring to Rule 7(4) of the Rules, 1992 which specifies the Caste Verification Committee after rejecting the claim of the applicant for grant of Validity Certificate, shall send a copy thereof and there upon the Directorate of Civil Rights Enforcement shall take steps to prosecute such claimant who has obtained a false Caste Certificate.  The court remarked “A reading of the aforesaid provisions clearly indicates that the petitioner can be prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section 420 only upon an order passed by the Caste Verification Committee rejecting the claim of the petitioner for grant of Validity Certificate and there upon the Directorate of the Civil Rights Enforcement shall take steps to prosecute the petitioner.”  Following which it held “The Caste Certificate issued in favour of the petitioner having not been cancelled under the provision of the Rules, 1992, cognizance taken by the learned Magistrate on the 7 basis of the final report is impermissible.”  Case Title: S Neelakantappa And State of Karnataka & ANR  Case No: CRIMINAL PETITION NO.6915/2016  Date of Order: 04-01-2023  Appearance:  Advocate Prabhugouda B Tumbigi for petitioner.

The Supreme Court observed that it can entertain new grounds raised for the first time in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence.

The Supreme Court observed that it can entertain new grounds raised for the first time in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence.  The principle in Order XLI Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure furthers the cause of justice by providing the party other than the 'aggrieved party' to raise any adverse findings against them and this Court can draw colour from it and permit objections to findings, the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed. In this case, the Trial Court dismissed a suit though it rejected the defendant's objection regarding lack of jurisdiction of the Trial Court. The High Court allowed the appeal by the plaintiff and reversed the judgment of the Trial Court. It was held that the auction conducted by Moradabad Development Authority in respect of the land in dispute is null and void. The question of jurisdiction was not considered by the High Court because he did not file a cross-objection against this finding of the Trial Court on the exercise of its jurisdiction. Saurav Jain, the defendant- auction purchaser who purchased the suit land from the MDA, approached the Apex court in appeal. He contended that the jurisdiction of the civil court is impliedly excluded under the provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976. Referring to Order XLI Rule 22 of the CPC, it was contended that a party, in whose favour the civil court has decreed a suit, can raise arguments against findings without having to file a cross- objection, in the appeal. In the appeal, the bench discussed the history and scope of Order XLI Rule 22 CPC as well as the applicability of the principle therein to proceedings before the Supreme Court Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. The Court observed that a party in whose favour a court has decreed the suit can challenge an adverse finding before the appellate court without a cross objection. Regarding the applicability of Order XLI Rule 22 CPC to an appeal under Article 136, the bench noted that in Ramanbhai Ashabhai Patel v. Dabhi Ajitkumar Fulsinji AIR 1965 SC 669. the constitution bench had held that the provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 of the CPC are not applicable to the Supreme Court. However, it was held that this deficiency must be supplemented by drawing from CPC, the bench said. The court thus observed: "27.....The principle stipulated in Order XLI Rule 22 of CPC can be applied to petitions under Article 136 of the Constitution because of this Court's wide powers to do justice under Article 142 of the Constitution. Since the principle in Order XLI Rule 22 of the CPC furthers the cause of justice by providing the party other than the 'aggrieved party' to raise any adverse findings against them, this Court can draw colour from Order XLI Rule 22 CPC and permit objections to findings.", the bench observed. The bench noted that, in this case, the ground of jurisdiction was only raised by the appellant before the Trial Court and not before the High Court.  However, referring to earlier judgments including Most Rev. P.M.A. Metropolitan v. Moran Mar Marthoma 1995 Supp (4) SCC 286, the bench said that the plea of a bar or lack of jurisdiction can be entertained at any stage, since an order or decree passed without jurisdiction is nonest in law. Thus, considering the case on merits, the bench held that ULCRA impliedly excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court on matters arising out of the ceiling proceeding. While disposing the appeal, the bench further observed: "Though the appellant did not assail the finding of the Trial Court on the issue of jurisdiction before the High Court under Order XLI Rule 22 CPC either by filing a memorandum of cross-objection or otherwise, he is not precluded from raising the argument before this Court. This Court in view of its plenary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution read with its power to do complete justice under Article 142, can entertain new grounds raised for the first time if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence, specifically one concerning jurisdiction of the court which goes to the root of the matter.", the court said while disposing the appeal.      
A document of partition which provides for effectuating a division of properties in future is not compulsorily registrable under Section 17 of the Registration Act, the Supreme Court has observed.The bench comprising of Justices L. Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna observed that a document which does not by itself create a right or interest in immovable property,... A document of partition which provides for effectuating a division of properties in future is not compulsorily registrable under Section 17 of the Registration Act, the Supreme Court has observed. The bench comprising of Justices L. Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna observed that a document which does not by itself create a right or interest in immovable property, but merely creates a right to obtain another document, does not require registration and is accordingly admissible in evidence. In this case, the Trial Court dismissed a suit filed by the ­plaintiff by holding that there was a prior partition between the parties in the year 1964 and the instant suit for partition and separate possession was not maintainable. This judgment was affirmed by the High Court. In appeal, one of the contentions raised by the plaintiff-appellant was that the so called partition of the suit schedule properties in the year 1964 was as per an award which was not registered as per section 17 (1) (e) of the Registration Act. Therefore, in the absence of registration of the arbitration award effecting the partition between members of the family, the award does not have any validity in the eye of law and hence it is not binding on the parties, it was contended. The other side (defendants) contended that registration of the arbitral award in the instant case as such is not a mandatory requirement. According to them, t so long as the parties are not allotted shares pertaining to specific assets under a partition deed such a document does not create any right, title or interest in any specific property as such To address these rival contentions,the bench perused the award. The court noted that the award is in the form of a resolution and there was no right created in any specific item or asset of the joint family properties in any person but the parties resolved to take certain actions in pursuance of a family arrangement.   "23.....The said document which has been styled as an award is, in our view, only a memorandum of understanding/family arrangement to be acted upon in future. Hence, in our considered view, the said document did not create rights in specific properties or assets of the family, in favour of specific persons. Therefore, the same did not require registration under section 17 (1) (e) of the Act. The said document was in the nature of a document envisaged under section 17 (2) (v) of the Act" "24. Having regard to the aforesaid provisions of law it can be safely concluded that the said award was a mere arrangement to divide the properties in future by metes and bounds as distinguished from an actual deed of partition under which there is not only a severance of status but also division of joint family properties by metes and bounds in specific properties. Hence it was exempted from registration under Section 17 (2) (v) of the Act. A document of partition which provides for effectuating a division of properties in future would be exempt from registration under section 17 (2) (v). The test in such a case is whether the document itself creates an interest in a specific immovable property or merely creates a right to obtain another document of title. If a document does not by itself create a right or interest in immovable property, but merely creates a right to obtain another document, which will, when executed create a right in the person claiming relief, the former document does not require registration and is accordingly admissible in evidence" In this case, there was a  finding of the first appellate court in A.S. No. 37 of 1993 that the suit properties were partitioned in the year 1964. Therefore, another issue that arose in this case was whether the said finding is  binding on the parties and whether a fresh suit filed by the Plaintiff seeking the very same relief was not maintainable? "The partition of the ancestral/joint family properties having found to have taken place in the 1964 and the same having been acted upon, a fresh suit for partition and separate possession of the suit properties was not at all maintainable. The principle of res judicata squarely applies in the present case.", the court said while dismissing the appeal.           
The Delhi High Court has said that the word 'acid' in Section 326A of the Indian Penal Code is not merely restricted to the substances which are classically or scientifically termed as acids but also includes all those substances which have an acidic, corrosive or burning nature and are capable of causing disfigurement, or temporary or permanent disability. Section 326A of the Code provides the punishment for acid attack. It states that whoever causes permanent or partial damage, disfigures or disables any part of the body of a person or causes grievous hurt by throwing acid shall be punished with imprisonment of a term not less than ten years, which may extend to imprisonment for life, and with fine.  A division of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Anish Dayal explained the provision in its decision on the appeals filed by three men convicted under Section 326A and 34 of the Code for throwing acid on a woman in 2014. The prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, said the bench while upholding the trial court decision. The counsel representing the convicts had argued that neither the alleged substance was sent for examination to ascertain the kind of acid it was nor were the clothes of the victim seized for further investigation. The prosecution was unable to prove that the alleged substance was acid, Senior Advocate Mahabir Singh argued.  However, the court termed the contention misplaced and observed that Section 326A covers a situation where partial or permanent damage to a person's body "can not only be caused by an acid but by 'any other means'." While referring to Section 326B, the court said Explanation 1 in the provision has provided meaning to the word 'acid' used in Section 326A. "'Acid', as per the said Explanation, includes any substance which has acidic or corrosive character of burning nature capable of causing bodily injury leading to scarce or disfigurement or temporary or permanent disability. Therefore by this provision, it is quite evident that the legislature has included in the meaning of "acid" two clear and categorical aspects: first, any substance with an acidic/corrosive/burning nature; and second, that it has the capability of causing bodily injury leading to scars or disfigurement or temporary or permanent disability," said the court. It added: "This is notwithstanding the fact that by including "any other means", the legislature has intended to apply Section 326A to a larger set of substances/methods which may cause such injuries to the person." The appellants before the court had challenged the December 2019 decision of the trial court. While two of them were sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1 lakh each, the third accused was awarded rigorous imprisonment of 10 years and fine of Rs. 50,000.  The trial court had ordered the victim will be paid an amount of Rs.1.25 lakhs as compensation out of the total fine.  Dismissing the appeals, the court said since the incident happened at railway lines and the appellants ran away afterwards, the question of recovering any part of the substance and to examine it did not arise.  "There would be no substantive residue lying there of the substance for the police to recover and examine. In any event, the nature of the substance is clearly of acidic/corrosive/burning nature as is evident from the medical testimonies of the doctors who examined the victim then and in subsequent years," the bench said.  The court was also of the view that the fact that victim's burnt clothes were not recovered and seized by the police was not a factor which could dilute the foundational fact that such an injury was not possible to be self-inflicted by any individual on himself or herself. It also said that it is impossible to accept that any person would go through tremendous pain and intense medical process just in order to implicate somebody falsely for an assault. However, on the aspect of the compensation, the bench directed that the full amount of fine be paid to the victim. The court also said she is entitled to a total compensation of at least Rs 5 Lakhs.   "Depending on what is finally paid as fine by the appellants and compensation received by the victim, this Court directs that the balance amount (out of total compensation of Rs. 5,00,000/-) be paid to the victim under Uttar Pradesh Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014 (as amended from time to time by the Government of Uttar Pradesh). Accordingly, a copy of this judgment be sent to the Secretary, State Legal Services Authority, Uttar Pradesh for information and necessary action," the court ordered. The Supreme Court in September 2015 had transferred the case from Mathura to Delhi after a petition was filed by the complainant.  Title: HAKIM & ANR v.

Stressing that when Medical Infrastructure which couldn't meet the medical requirements of our people in normal times then it definitely had to collapse in the face of the present pandemic, the Allahabad High Court in Monday (May 17) suggested several measures for the development of the medical infrastructure in the State. A Division Bench of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar... Stressing that when Medical Infrastructure which couldn't meet the medical requirements of our people in normal times then it definitely had to collapse in the face of the present pandemic, the Allahabad High Court in Monday (May 17) suggested several measures for the development of the medical infrastructure in the State.  A Division Bench of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar also observed,  "So far as the medical infrastructure is concerned, in these few months we have realized that in the manner it stands today, it is very delicate, fragile and debilitated"  Further, the Court suggested the following measures and asked the Government to check their viability at the highest level and file a report on the next date:  All nursing homes should have an oxygen facility on every bed. Every nursing home/ hospital which has more than 20 beds should have at least 40 percent beds as Intensive Care Units. Of the designated 40 percent; 25 percent should have ventilators, 25 percent should have High Flow Nasal Cannula and 50 percent of the 40 per cent reserved beds should have BiPAP machines. This should be made compulsorily for all the nursing homes/ hospitals in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Every nursing home/ hospital which has more than 30 beds should compulsorily have an oxygen production plant. In the State of Uttar Pradesh, we find that apart from various Institutes like Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute and the Universities like the King George's Medical University and Banaras Hindu University, we have five more medical colleges in Prayagraj, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Gorakhpur. These Colleges should have enhanced facilities as are there with the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute within a period of four months. Emergency laws should be applied for the acquisition of land for them. Funds should be provided to them forthwith so that they graduate from a medical college to an Institute of the standard of the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute. For this there should also be given a certain extent of autonomy.   Regarding the medical infrastructure in villages and small urban towns, the Court said that they should be given all kinds of pathology facilities and treatments should be made available in Community Health Centres which are at par to the treatment given by Level-2 hospitals in bigger cities.   Importantly, the Court said,  "If a patient however becomes serious in the rural areas or in small towns then ambulances with all kinds of Intensive Care Unit facilities should be provided so that the patient can be brought to a hospital which has proper medical facilities in a bigger town."   Other measures suggested by the Court  Every B Grade and C Grade town of the State of Uttar Pradesh should be provided with at least 20 ambulances and every village should be provided with at 14 least 2 ambulances having Intensive Care Unit facilities. Ambulances should be made available within a period of one month. With these ambulances' patients from smaller towns and villages can be brought to bigger hospitals in bigger towns.   Importantly, the Court asked the Government to not linger this matter and by the next date come up with a definite report as to how this upgradation of Medical Colleges shall be done in four months' time.  Lastly, the Court directed the appointment of Nodal Officers by the District Judges of districts Bijnor, Bahraich, Barabanki, Shrawasti, Jaunpur, Mainpuri, Mau, Aligarh, Etah, Etawah, Firozabad, and Deoria in terms of its order dated 27.04.2021.   The Court has asked them to submit their reports within a week's time in the light of directions contained in its order dated 27.04.2021.   The State respondents have also been directed to give the details relating to the above districts in terms of our order dated 11.05.2021.

The Kerala High Court on Friday held that the bail granted in one crime cannot be cancelled merely because the accused has been subsequently booked in another case. Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas observed that a bail that had once been granted ought not to be cancelled on the mere asking, but that there ought to be cogent and overwhelming circumstances existing to cancel the bail. "The mere registration of a subsequent crime against the accused by itself cannot result in an automatic cancellation of bail. Registration of a subsequent crime is only an indication of an allegation or a complaint of the accused having been involved in a subsequent crime. The presumption of innocence available to the accused in the second crime, the right to liberty as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India which envelopes every provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure are factors which cannot be forgotten by the Court when called upon to cancel the bail. The possibility of false accusations being alleged with oblique motives also cannot be ignored. The nature of the subsequent offence and the persons against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed, the stage of the case wherein cancellation is sought are also factors that require appreciation. Apart from the above, while arriving at the conclusion to cancel the bail, the Court must also consider whether the accused had misused the liberty granted in such a manner that it has a tendency to interfere with the due course of the administration of justice. Thus, every case presents a unique situation and close scrutiny ought to be indulged in to identify whether overwhelming circumstances are indeed present in the subsequent crime which necessitates the cancellation of bail earlier granted," the Court observed.  The petitioner accused was initially charged with offences punishable under sections 341, 323, 324, 325, 394 and 201 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code for attacking a woman and causing grievous hurt and also stealing her mobile phone. After the petitioner was taken into custody on May 23, 2022, he was granted bail on June 2, 2022. One of the conditions imposed by the Magistrate while granting bail was that the petitioner should not get involved in any other crime.   However, subsequently, the petitioner was arrayed in another crime for "displaying his nudity before a lady and brandishing a chopper" in an attempt to commit culpable homicide and shouting obscene words on a public road. The case was registered under sections 294(b), 323, 308, 354 and 354A IPC.  He was granted bail in the second crime, as well. Meanwhile, a petition was filed by the prosecution to cancel the bail granted in the first crime due to his involvement in the second crime. The Magistrate allowed the petition filed by the prosecution.   It was submitted by Advocates Rajith and Ramakrishnan M.N. on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned order cancelling bail was erroneous since the Magistrate failed to consider the absence of any overwhelming circumstance to cancel the same. It was further pointed out that the second crime was registered without any basis and was an instance of false implication.  The Public Prosecutor Sreeja V. argued that the condition imposed while granting bail that the petitioner shall not involve in any other crime while on bail, ought to be given the sanctity it deserves, and that if petitioner's involvement in the second crime is ignored, it would pave the way for the condition to become redundant.   The court observed that while Section 437 Cr.P.C. provides for grant of bail to a person accused of a non-bailable offence when produced before a court other than the High Court or Court of Sessions, it also confers power on the court to impose conditions while granting bail.  In this case, it is in pursuance of the same that the Magistrate imposed the condition that the 'petitioner shall not involve in any other crime while on bail', noted the court.  The Court went on to take note of a plethora of decisions in this regard which state that bail ought not to be cancelled on the mere asking, but that there ought to be cogent and overwhelming circumstances to do so. The bail should not be cancelled in a mechanical manner, it added. The Court observed that in P v. Madhya Pradesh & Anr. (2022), one of the conditions for canceling bail was if the person misuses his liberty by indulging in similar or other criminal activity. In Imran v. Muhammed Bhava (2022), it was held that certain supervening circumstances impeding a fair trial must develop after granting bail to an accused for its cancellation The Court also made a reference to Godson v. State of Kerala (2022), wherein it was observed that a mere violation of the bail conditions was not sufficient to cancel the bail but the satisfaction of the court that it is necessary to do so based on various factors ought to be arrived at. In the present case, the court noted that the Magistrate had, in exercise of the discretion to grant bail, released the petitioner on bail even in the second crime. Despite the same, the petitioner had remained in jail for more than two months, it added. "Though the allegation as regards the second crime is serious, taking into reckoning the contention that the petitioner has been falsely implicated and the absence of any injury on any person and the general allegation that the accused attempted to commit culpable homicide by brandishing a sword in a public road, this Court is of the view that the second crime cannot be treated as overwhelming enough to impede fair trial in the first crime for cancelling the bail already granted. Further, the final report in the crime in which bail was sought to be cancelled was filed much earlier and there is no allegation that the petitioner had misused his liberty against the defacto complainant therein," it was observed. Accordingly, the Court was of the view that despite the registration of the subsequent crime against the petitioner, having regard to the nature of allegations, the order cancelling bail had to be interfered with.  It thus set aside the order canceling bail, and directed the petitioner to be released from custody forthwith, if not required in any other case. Case Title: Renjith v. State of Kerala   
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) recently informed the Kerala High Court that the 'Formal Prior Recognition Letter' issued by the State Government to schools under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules ('RTE Rules'), Kerala, is not confined to any particular period, and that no further such recognition letter would be necessary for extending the affiliation to the Board every five years.   It was further informed by the Standing Counsel of CBSE S. Nirmal that as per the latest Handbook issued by the CBSE, Schools also had the option to produce a 'System Generated Self Certification/System Generated DEO Certificate' with respect to the aspects mentioned in Appendix-III of the Affiliation Bye-Laws and that the CBSE would act upon the same while processing the application for continuation of affiliation.  The Single Judge Bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran, thus observed in this regard that the said stand of the CBSE,  "renders the position ineluctably clear that, the schools now have the option of approaching them for continuing their self affiliation based on their own certification or a System Generated Certification; and it is only if the same is found to be insufficient and they being so informed by the CBSE, would they then require to apply for and obtain the certificate as per Appendix - III of the “Affiliation Bye-Laws”, from the Educational Authority".  The case arose after the judgment delivered by the same Court in The Manager Life Valley International School v. State of Kerala [WP(C)No.22812/2020], seeking directions to the competent Deputy Director of Education (DDE) of the State to issue them a 'formal prior recognition letter', in Form No. II, appended to the RTE Rules, so as to enable them to seek application with the CBSE. The Court had in the said case, directed that any such application made by a School seeking an 'Order of Prior Recognition' under Rule 14 of the RTE Rules, would be issued by the concerned Deputy Directors of Education only in Form No. II of the Rules after following the due procedure, and making the necessary inspections.   It is the case of the petitioner that following the said judgment, although no further 'Formal Prior Recognition Letter' was required to be obtained by them for continuation of affiliation from the CBSE, the Government had thereafter issued an Order dated November 9, 2022, which the petitioner claimed 'virtually mandated' the issuance of the same, and that the competent Authority would charge Rs.10,000/- as expenses, with incremental increase every year.  It was contended by the counsels for the petitioner that the order issued by the Government was unnecessary and untenable, since as per the RTE Rules, no Formal Prior Recognition Letter was necessary for seeking continuation of affiliation from the CBSE. It was pointed out that the Formal Prior Recognition Letter was not confined to any period, but effective from the date on which it is issued. It was thus submitted that when the Schools are to apply for continuation of affiliation, as per the Affiliation Bye-Laws, 2018, all that was required was to submit a self attested certificate, in the format available in Appendix III, without having to get it certified by the Educational Authority of the State. It was submitted that the State Educational Authorities had misinterpreted the provision, and insisted on each school to apply for a new Formal Prior Recognition Letter.  On the other hand, it was argued by the counsels on behalf of the respondents that even if no Formal Prior Recognition Letter was required to be obtained by the Schools for seeking continuation of their affiliation with the CBSE every five years, it was mandatory to obtain a certificate from the District Educational Officer, or such other competent Educational Authority, with respect to their infrastructural and other facilities.  It is at this juncture that Standing Counsel for CBSE had affirmed that the Formal Prior Recognition Letter was not confined to a particular period, but takes effect from the date of issuance, and that there was no insistence on a further letter for continuation of affiliation. He however, pointed out that the Schools would have to submit a certificate as per the format in Appendix - III of the Affiliation Bye-Laws, wherein they would have to vouch for their infrastructural facilities, and essential safety requirements. He further added that in the event of the CBSE finding any discrepancy in the System Generated Certificate that had been provided for in the Handbook, and feel that physical inspection by the Educational Officer of the State would be necessary, they would inform the School about the same pursuant to which the latter would have to obtain the necessary certification as per Appendix-III of the Affiliation Bye-Laws.  The Court thus found that the impugned order issued by the Government would be of relevance only if any school is required to approach the competent Educational Authority of the State, for the certification, on being so asked to do by the CBSE.  "Apodictically, therefore, the petitioners need not now harbour any grievance against this order, since it would apply to them only if they are constrained by the CBSE to seek certification from the Educational Authority, and not otherwise," it observed.  The Court also did not find the imposition of charge on the schools for inspection of the infrastructural and safety imperatives, as stipulated by the CBSE Affiliation Bye-laws to be illegal or unfair.  The Court further clarified that the impugned orders issued by the Government would be read down to the effect as stated in the order.  "Consequently, should the Schools approach the jurisdictional Educational Authority, they will only be competent to issue the afore certification and not a 'Formal Recognition Letter', for continuing the affiliation," it was added.  The petitioners were represented by Advocates M.R. Venugopal, Dhanya P. Ashokan, and S. Muhammad Alikhan. Senior Government Pleader Nisha Bose appeared on behalf of the respondents. Standing Counsel of CBSE S. Nirmal also appeared in the present case.  Case Title: The Village International School & Anr v. State of Kerala & Ors.   
The Gujarat High Court has held that where substantial evidence to connect an accused with the crime is lacking, other corroborative evidence loses its significance.In light of the aforesaid, a Bench comprising Justices SH Vora and Rajendra Sareen upheld an order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Court in a criminal case under Sections 143, 147, 148 and 302 of the Indian Penal... The Gujarat High Court has held that where substantial evidence to connect an accused with the crime is lacking, other corroborative evidence loses its significance. In light of the aforesaid, a Bench comprising Justices SH Vora and Rajendra Sareen upheld an order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Court in a criminal case under Sections 143, 147, 148 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code and Sec 135(1) of the Bombay Police Act.  The High Court cited the lack of direct evidence, oral or documentary, warranting any interference with acquittal.  The Bench observed that the deceased-victim had a sister who was eve teased five years prior to the murder of the victim which had led to a heated exchange of words and eventually led to the death of victim. Per the Prosecution, all the five accused persons had formed an unlawful assembly with a common intention to murder the deceased. They were also armed with lathis and pipes and delivered blows on the victim. Consequently, he sustained severe injuries. The victim was admitted to the hospital where he was declared dead.   The Prosecution presented 14 witnesses to bring home the charges before the trial court. Accused No. 4 also expired during the pendency of the criminal appeal. The Bench observed that a large number of Prosecution witnesses had turned hostile. A child witness had earlier given the names of assailants and informed about the assailants to the Complainant. However, during the deposition, she deposed that she had not given any names and had not seen the offence. The child also admitted that when the first pipe blow was inflicted on the head of his father, the deceased, he ran away crying. The trial court had, therefore, refused to believe the child witness as eyewitness. There was also absence of other independent corroborative evidence which could prove the Respondents' guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The incident of eve teasing cited by the Prosecution as motive for committing the offence was found illogical by the Trial Judge which was affirmed by the High Court.  Consequently, the Bench opined:  "When substantial evidence is lacking to connect the respondents accused with the crime or not brought on record sufficient evidence to establish the guilt, other corroborative evidence loses its significance or needs any consideration to upset the findings and therefore, there is no need to overburden the judgment anymore or needs any discussion of such evidence."  The High Court also emphasised the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that in an acquittal appeal if the other view is possible, then the Appellate Court cannot substitute its own view by reversing the acquittal into conviction unless the findings of the trial court are perverse, contrary to the material on record or palpably wrong.   Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.  Case Title: STATE OF GUJARAT Versus KISHORBHAI DEVJIBHAI PARMAR & 4 other(s)         
The Karnataka High Court has held that state government cannot interfere and control the fee structure of private unaided educational institutions. It thus declared as ultra vires Section 48 of the Karnataka Education Act 1983 which prohibits private unaided schools from collecting fee in any manner except as prescribed by the State government A single judge bench of Justice E S Indiresh referred to TMA Pai Foundation case and agreed that the decision on the fee structure must be left to the private unaided educational institutions, as those educational institutions do not seek or are not dependent upon any funds from the Government. It also agreed that their financial affairs are affected by giving admissions to students through RTE. The bench thus observed that interference by the respondent-State insofar as fixing of fee by the private unaided educational institutions violates Article 14 of the Constitution. The bench also declared Sections 2(11-A) and 124-A of the Act to be contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution Section 124-A is regarding the penalty for contravention of Section 48. Section 2(11-A) pertains to the constitution of the District Education Regulatory Authority to monitor these institutions. The court also declared Sections 5-A (pertaining to Safety and security of students) and 112-A (Penalty for contravention of Section 5-A) of the Act to be contrary to Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Further it declared that any notifications issued by the state government under the said sections and rules are held unconstitutional and they are not applicable to private unaided educational institutions. The Court however cautioned the institutions to not cross the 'Lakshman Rekha'. “The cardinal rule would be to act just, fair and reasonable while formulating the fee structure, so that, no child would be deprived of elementary education in this welfare State, to fulfil the dreams of founding fathers of the Constitution of India. Dreams of children shall run in reality of their blood and heart.” Petitioners Arguments: The petitioners, private unaided educational institutions, primarily argued that they are different from the aided educational institutions insofar as financial aspects and therefore, the fee structure of these private unaided educational institutions should be distinct and cannot be controlled by the Fee structure imposed by the respondent-State. Further, relying upon the judgment in the case of TMA Pai, it was urged that these private educational institutions have a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, particularly in respect of admissions to the Institutions, and therefore, these institutions have an autonomy and independence to have their own fee structure. Moreover, these institutions are not aided or funded by the State-Government and the fee structure of the StateGovernment is lesser than what has been prescribed by the institutions coming under the purview of RTE Act and therefore, Rule 10 of the Rules 1995, which provides for collection of fees, cannot be made applicable to the unaided private educational institutions and accordingly, sought for invalidating Rule 10 of Rules 1995 and Rule 4 of Rules 1999, as ultra vires the Constitution of India, so also, contrary to the law declared in T.M.A. PAI FOUNDATION case. State opposed the pleas The State government sought to justify the Notification dated 18th May, 2018, by which it sought to regulate fees in private unaided institutes. It submitted that the notification was issued taking into account the interest of Children and to control the educational institutions from charging capitation fee and becoming profit motive.” Findings: The bench relied heavily on Karnataka Unaided Schools V/S State Of Karnataka, whereby a Division bench of the High Court last year quashed Sections 5, 7(5)(b), 7(1)(e) and 38(1)(a) of the Act and Rule 18(2 & 3), Rule 19(3) of the Rules 1995, and Rule 4 of Rules 1999 as ultra vires the Constitution of India and contrary to the decision of TMA Pai. The bench said “The same is binding on the petitioners, for in some of these writ petitions those provisions are impugned.” Further the court said “Section 48 of the Act provides for Fees and Donations and Section 51 of the Act provides for Monies Received from sources other than grant shall be accounted. These two provisions run contrary to each other. Therefore, the right to levy, collect and charge fees, donations and other payments as provided under Section 48 of the Act, is to be held unconstitutional, as there is direct interference of the Government authorities with the administration of the private unaided educational institutions.” It also said “When enabling provisions itself are unconstitutional and ultra vires, the penal provision flowing therefrom for violation of provisions, cannot be sustained. In that view of the matter, amending provision, i.e. Section 1(2)(iiia) of the Act, extending the Act to the schools affiliated to CBSE/ICSE, is beyond the competence of the Act.” Noting that though Section 124-A provides for penalty for contravention of Section 48 of the Act. However, there are no relevant rules nor the Act provides for conducting investigation, extending opportunity to the erring private unaided educational institutions, before taking action under Section 48 following Section 124-A of the Act. The bench held “On this count alone, these two provisions, i.e. Sections 48 and 124-A of the Act, violate principles of natural justice enunciated under Article 14 of the Constitution of India and therefore, the same are held to be invalidated.” The bench also pointed that the state government, has not produced any document to satisfy the court that the impugned Notification/Amendment/Rules made to the Education Act, was Assented by the President and the said Notification/Amendment/Rules was assented by the Governor. Following which it said, “I am of the opinion that any such amendment made to the Act without obtaining the Assent of the President in a field occupied by both the levels of the Government (concurrent list), amounts to procedural illegality and therefore, such amendment made to the Act requires to be held as unconstitutional on the question of competency. The impugned Notification/Amendment/Rules were gazetted without the Assent of the President, and same are unconstitutional.” Rules for Safety of Children should be for all: While striking down Section 5A the bench observed “No material has been produced by the respondent-Government showing that it has framed frame rules under Sections 5-A and 112-A of the Act, nor implemented the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of AVINASH MEHROTRA v. UNION OF INDIA reported in (2009)6 SCC 398 in respect of safety standards in schools and related requirements. Following which it urged the government to “Frame an independent rule governing the safety standards to be maintained, not only in private schools, but also, in a strict sense implement the same in Government Schools.” Thus it held “I am of the view that Section 5-A of the Act suffers from infirmity under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In view of the fact that Section 5-A is contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution of India, hence the corresponding penal provision provided under Section 112-A of the Act, is also unconstitutional and is liable to be set aside.” Case Title: Rashmi Education Trust Vidyaniketan School & Others v.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that there is no penal provision under any statute to bring the political parties within the clutches of enforcement authorities, in case, they fail to fulfill their promises as made in the election manifesto.The Bench of Justice Dinesh Pathak further clarified that a political party as a whole can't be made liable under the Representation of Peoples... The Allahabad High Court has observed that there is no penal provision under any statute to bring the political parties within the clutches of enforcement authorities, in case, they fail to fulfill their promises as made in the election manifesto. The Bench of Justice Dinesh Pathak further clarified that a political party as a whole can't be made liable under the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 for adopting corrupt practices of the election. The case in brief Essentially, one Khurshidurehman S. Rehman moved an application under Section 156 (3) CrPC with an allegation that Bhartiya Janta Party headed by the then Party President Amit Shah had wooed the voters with several promises but it had failed to fulfill the promises as made in the Election Manifesto-2014. It was further alleged that Shah had committed crimes of fraud, cheating, criminal breach of trust, dishonesty, defamation, deceiving, and allurement. However, the aforesaid application was rejected by the trial court (Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aligarh) in October 2020. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the trial court, the applicant (petitioner herein) preferred a revision plea, which was was dismissed affirming the order passed by the trial court. Challenging the same, the petitioner moved to the HC submitting that the courts below had illegally rejected an application under Section 156 (3) CrPC and that nonfulfillment of promises as made in the Election Manifesto 2014 makes out a clear cut criminal case against Shah, who is liable to be summoned and tried under different sections of IPC. On the other hand, senior counsel Manish Goyal (Additional Advocate General) assisted by Advocate A. K. Sand contended that on the face of an application, no cognizable offence is made out against Shah to be tried by the court below.  It was further contended that non-fulfilling the conditions as averred in the election manifesto does not come within the ambit of any law, and therefore, it cannot be enforced under any legislation.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that the question in hand was - as to whether non-fulfillment of any promise as made in the Election Manifesto-2014 amounts to commission of the cognizable offence in the eye of law so as to make it indispensable for a magistrate to forward the complaint to the police for investigation under Section 156 (3) CrPC. In an attempt to answer the query posed by the Court itself, the Court observed that in view of Apex Court's ruling in the case of Subramaniam Balaji Vs. The Government of Tamil Nadu and others, (2013) 9 SCC 659, wherein it was held that promises made in the manifesto cannot be treated to be corrupt practice as is denoted under Section 123 in The Representation of the People Act, 1951.  "No penal provision has been provided considering the non-fulfillment of the promises as made in the election manifesto as a crime. Though under The Representation of the People Act, 1951, there is a provision for registering the political parties but there is no specific provision for the cancellation of their registration on any ground including the alleged false promise as made in the election manifesto," the Court further added. In view of this observation, the Court opined that the election manifesto promulgated by any political party is a statement of their policy, view, promises, and vow during the election, which is not the binding force and the same cannot be implemented through the courts of law. In view of this, the Court concluded that the petitioner had failed to substantiate his submissions in assailing the orders impugned, as to how cognizable offence is made out in the present matter for the purposes of issuing a direction for investigation as enunciated under Section 156 (3) CrPC.  "Non-occurrence of any cognizable offence is also one of the paramount condition which averted the courts below from issuing a direction for investigation in exercise of powers under Sections 156 (3) CrPC," observed the Court as it as it found no justifiable ground to exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of Indian to interfere in the impugned orders. The present writ petition, being devoid of merits and misconceived, was dismissed with no order as to the costs.     
The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices MR Shah and CT Ravi Kumar have held that academic qualifications are a valid criteria to differentiate pay scale for different employees even when the nature of the work undertaken by them is more or less the same.  Issue posed before the Top Court The issue before the top court was, "Whether in a case where the educational qualifications for the post of Nursing Assistant and Staff Nurse are different, still the Nursing Assistants shall be entitled to the Nursing Allowance at par with the Staff Nurses?" Facts of the Civil Appeal with its Judicial History in Brief The present Civil Appeal was filed by the Union of India feeling aggrieved with the judgment passed by the High Court of Gauhati which held that the original writ petitioners are entitled to Nursing Allowance. The respondents, in the appeal, were Nursing Assistants in various hospitals under the establishment of Border Security Force. All of them were being paid the ‘Hospital Patient Care Allowance’. According to the original writ petitioners, they were entitled to the Nursing Allowance like it was being given to the Staff Nurse. Therefore, a writ petition was filed before the High Court. The claim of the original writ petitioners claiming Nursing Allowance at par with the Nursing Staff was opposed by the appellants contending that they were being paid the special allowance known as ‘Hospital Patient Care Allowance’ and were therefore not entitled to the Nursing Allowance at par with Staff Nurses as they are not qualified as a Staff Nurse. Decision of the Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court  The Single Judge, negating the objection of the appellants, observed that the duties performed by the writ petitioners are the similar duties performed by the Staff Nurses. Single Judge further also observed that educational qualification cannot be a ground for denial of Nursing Allowance. Subsequently, the Division Bench, too, dismissed the Appeal. Therefore the Appellants had moved the Supreme Court.  Appellant’s Arguments before the SC Ms. Madhavi Divan, ASG, who was appearing for the Appellant submitted that, “It is submitted that so far as the qualification of the Staff Nurses is concerned, it is four years course and so far as the Nursing Assistants are concerned, they have completed only one year course which is the requirement for the post of Nursing Assistants. Therefore, they shall not be entitled to claim the Nursing Allowance at par with the Staff Nurses.” It was further submitted by Ms. Divan that, “as observed and held by this Court in a catena of decisions classification of the different pay scales is permissible based upon educational qualifications, experience and nature of duties.” Respondent’s Reply The Respondents argued that, "Nursing Assistants are being integral part of the nursing service and when both the Nursing Assistants as well as the Staff Nurses are integral part of the nursing service and would be performing the similar duties, the High court has not committed any error in directing to pay Nursing Allowance to the Nursing Assistants at par with the Staff Nurse." Analysis  'High Court has committed a serious error' The court held, "The view taken by the High Court is contrary to the decisions of this Court in the case of Punjab State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited and Another versus Balbir Kumar Walia and others, (2021) 8 SCC 784; Director of Elementary Education, Odisha and Others versus Pramod Kumar Sahoo, (2019) 10 SCC 674 and Secretary Department of Personnel Public Grievances & Pension & Anr. versus T.V.L.N. Mallikarjuna Rao, (2015) 3 SCC 653." It is important to point out that in the above mentioned cases, the Supreme Court has upheld the different pay scales/pay structure based on different educational qualifications and has reiterated that different educational qualification and experience prescribed for appointment can be a ground to have different pay scales/pay structures. Educational Qualification is a valid criteria  The court therefore held, "Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand the view taken by the High Court that the educational qualification cannot be a ground for denial of Nursing Allowance to the Nursing Assistants is unsustainable. The Nursing Assistants in the BSF neither have relevant experience for appointment as Staff Nurse nor they possess any educational qualification for appointment as Staff Nurse. Therefore, the case of Nursing Assistants cannot be compared with that of the Staff Nurses as both carry different educational qualification."  "In view of the above and for the reason stated above present appeal succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court holding and directing that the original writ petitioners – Nursing Assistants shall be entitled to Nursing Allowance at par with the Staff Nurse is hereby quashed and set aside," the court added.

The Supreme Court has reiterated that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by another ad hoc employee and can be replaced by only a regularly appointed candidate."It is a settled principle of law that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by another ad hoc employee and he can be replaced only by another candidate who is regularly appointed by following a regular procedure prescribed", the... The Supreme Court has reiterated that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by another ad hoc employee and can be replaced by only a regularly appointed candidate. "It is a settled principle of law that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by another ad hoc employee and he can be replaced only by another candidate who is regularly appointed by following a regular procedure prescribed", the Court observed. Reliance in this respect was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Rattan Lal and others vs. State of Haryana(1985) 4 SCC 43 and others and on the order in the case of Hargurpratap Singh vs. State of Punjab and others (2007) 13 SCC 292. A Bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai made this observation while considering appeals related to appointment of teachers in colleges in Madhya Pradesh. The appellants were appointed as guest teachers on contractual basis under the "Jan Bhagidari Scheme" in Madhya Pradesh. After the end of the academic year, their services were terminated and a fresh notification was issued. Aggrieved with that, the appellants approached the High Court. A Single Bench granted them relief by directing that they should be allowed to continue to work on their respective posts till regular selections were made. The Single Bench direction was set aside by a Division Bench on State's appeal. This led the appellants to approach the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court observed that even though it was strenuously urged by the State that the appointments of the appellants were as guest lecturers and not as ad hoc employees, from the nature of the advertisements, it could clearly be seen that the appellants were appointed on ad hoc basis. Therefore, the court did not fine any error in single judge's direction directing the writ petitioners to continue to work on their respective posts till regular selections are made. The Bench however held that the direction issued by the single judge of the High Court that the writ petitioners would be entitled to get the salary in accordance with the UGC circular is not sustainable, as the advertisements clearly provided that the selected candidates would be paid the honorarium to be determined by the Jan Bhaghidari Committee. The Court has held that the­ appellants would be entitled to continue on their respective posts till they are replaced by regularly selected candidate. Further, they would be entitled to honorarium at the rate of Rs.1,000/­ per hour as is being paid to them presently.

Questioning the Ministry of Home Affairs's decision to confine House Rent Allowance (HRA) benefit only to Personnel Below Officer Rank (PBORs), the Delhi High Court has said that every personnel in the paramilitary forces shall be entitled to the benefit irrespective of the rank, as per their entitlement.  A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Saurabh Banerjee has directed the Centre and other authorities to take necessary steps within six weeks, in consultation with Ministry of Home Affairs as well as Ministry of Finance, to grant HRA benefit to such personnel.  "We are unable to find any reason as to why officers belonging to the rank of Officers / Coy Commanders or PBROs, should not be granted similar benefit more so as the factum of their serving at far off locations has been recognized and it cannot be differentiated on cadre basis. We fail to understand why such policy decisions discriminating within the force should be permitted to continue, especially to the officers of the force who spend their lives serving the nation," the court said.  The bench was hearing pleas moved by nine individuals, group officers in Grade-A in the Border Security Force (BSF), holding posts in the rank of Assistant Commandant, Deputy Commandant and Second-in-Command. It was their case that despite construction of the family accommodations, they along with other similarly situated officers were neither provided with the Government accommodation nor were they being paid HRA for keeping their families at different locations.  As per the official memorandum issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on July 31, 2017, the competent authority under the Seventh Pay Commission recommended that the personnel of the uniformed services can keep their families at any location and would be paid HRA. However, the said recommendations were confined to the PBORs and denied to the Group-A officers.  A representation was preferred by the petitioners against the OM which was forwarded to MHA for consideration. However, the same was rejected vide a Signal dated March 15, 2018. Both the OM and Singal were challenged by the petitioners to the extent that the benefit was confined to PBORs, thereby seeking inclusion of similarly situated personnel for HRA. The bench appreciated the recommendations of Seventh Pay Commission acknowledging services of uniformed services regarding HRA and agreed with the view that such officers are required to stay in the fields, far off from the necessary amenities while leaving their families behind.  However, the court said it fails to understand as to why the Commission "only thought of giving parity to the PBORs of CAPF at par with PBORs of Defence Forces" while leaving behind the proposal of extending the same benefit to Coy Commanders (officers of the level of Assistant Commandants/ Deputy Commandants). "We, while holding the Chair as the Judges of this Court as well as normal civilians, respect their will power to stay away from their families," the court said, adding that "a strange anomaly" was being sought to be corrected in the matter.  The court noted that the respondents, neither in the counter affidavit nor during the arguments, made submission that the proposal of extending the same benefit to Coy Commanders/ Officers of Group A was under consideration. "To the contrary, the stand of respondents is that the impugned Signal has been passed in compliance of the recommendations W.P.(C) 11083/2019 & W.P.(C) of the Seventh Pay Commission," the court noted. Observing that the respondent authorities cannot be permitted to take a discriminatory view for personnel of different forces deployed in common areas for grant of HRA, the court set aside the impugned Signal and letter rejecting petitioners' request for HRA.  The court also partly set aside MHA's OM, directing the authorities to extend the benefit to all the personnel of the Forces irrespective of their rank, as per their entitlement.

While considering the issue of long pendency of criminal appeals in the Allahabad High Court, the Supreme Court has observed that the High Court must explore granting bail to convicts who have undergone eight years of the sentence. The Court observed that the bail is the rule where the convict has already undergone eight years of actual sentence. Broad parameter of 50 per cent of sentence undergone is applicable in cases other than life sentences for grant of bail to convicts in appeals. "The High Court must explore whether in all cases where convicts have undergone a sentence of actual eight years, the convicts can be considered for grant of bail", a bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundersh observed.   "The fact of the matter is that if an appeal is pending at the High Court stage and the convict has already undergone eight years of actual sentence, exceptions apart, in most cases bail would be the rule. Despite this, the cases are not coming up for consideration. We are not clear as to how much time does it take for a bail application to be listed in such a case. There may be convicts who may not be able to have the requisite access to legal advice for moving the bail application," the bench observed while granting four weeks time to the High Court to place before the Top Court a policy strategy in this behalf.  Taking note of the fact that there might be even convicts in custody in cases other than a life sentence, the bench said that in these cases the High Court could consider granting bail by considering the broad parameter of 50 per cent of the actual sentence undergone. "We may note that there may be even convicts in custody in cases other than life sentence cases and in those cases again the broad parameter of 50 per cent of the actual sentence undergone can be the basis for grant of bail", the Supreme Court stated. The bench acknowledged that there might be a  scenario where an appeal comes up for hearing and the appellant may be seeking adjournment rather than arguing the appeal. The might not be a case for grant of bail as the High Court is willing to bestow consideration on the merits of the appeal.  "We are also in agreement that the convict must approach the High Court first as otherwise, this Court is being unnecessarily burdened but then there must be a mechanism to see that if he approaches the High Court, those bail applications are listed promptly," Court said.  "In the conspectus of our broad observations, it is incumbent on the High Court to place before us as to how they propose to see that the cases mentioned aforesaid are taken up for consideration for grant of bail," Court noted in its order.  The Top Court while hearing the same matter had also registered suo moto case on the issue of long pendency of appeals in the Allahabad High Court.

The Allahabad High Court last week directed its Registrar General to lodge a First Information Report (FIR) in the matter, after it found that 3 petitions were filed before the Court in the name of an advocate who has already died.  The Bench of Justice Samit Gopal was presiding over a bail plea, filed in the name of the deceased lawyer, when it noted that 3 other pleas have also been filed in the name of the same advocate who has reportedly passed away in the year 2014.  "The common feature in all the three above petitions is that Sri Aditya Narayan Singh, Advocate (who is reported to have died on 16.05.2014) has been the sole counsel in two matters and one of the counsels in the writ petition," the Court remarked.  Background of the matter  The Court was hearing the bail plea of on behalf of two murder accused Kamlesh Yadav and Rajesh Chauhan (again, filed in the name of the deceased advocate), however, even when no one appeared on behalf of them, the Court took up the matter in the revised list, and noted thus:  "The present bail application is an example of a mischievous filing of a case before a Court of law by fictitious person(s)."  Earlier, on July 26, appearing before the Court, an Advocate named Abhishek Kumar had informed the Court that though the bail application was shown to be filed by advocate Aditya Narayan Singh and Advocate Rajesh Chandra Tiwari, however, alleged that it was mischief by someone.  He further informed the Court that Advocate Aditya Narayan Singh had expired around two years back and the Advocate Roll No. A/R1202/12 is of some one else, and not of Sri Rajesh Chandra Tiwari.  He also apprised the Court of three other pleas, in which the said deceased advocate had been named as an advocate.  Under these circumstances, the Court observed thus:  "…it is apparent that the present bail application has been filed in a clandestine manner for the reasons best known to the person(s) who have played mischief by filing the same and then not appearing before the Court to press the same."   Further, noting that the bail application is a bogus bail application and that the Court cannot shut its eye to the said issue, the Court prima facie opined that the bail application had been filed in clandestine manner.   Lastly, the Registrar General was directed to register an FIR in the matter and also directed that the investigation in the matter be done seriously so as to cull out the truth and appropriate action be taken against person(s) involved in the bogus and clandestine filing of the bail application.  "The needful be done within one month from today. 16. The Senior Superintendent of Police, Prayagraj is directed to ensure that the investigation is done by a responsible and a competent police officer efficiently," the Court further added.

While hearing a public interest litigation seeking to institutionalise effective machinery and mechanism for rescue and post rescue rehabilitation of all child labourers in the State of Rajasthan, a division bench of the High Court has observed that a firm and concrete action plan is required from the state to curb child labour activities in the state. The present public interest litigation is filed by Advocate Gopal Singh Bareth. Notably, in compliance with the court's previous order on 17.06.2020, the state has formed a high level committee comprising the Secretary, Department of Labour and the Labour Commissioner as Chairman and Secretary of that committee respectively. Further, detailed directions were also issued in the present matter on 28.09.2020 by the court.  Acting Chief Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Justice Sameer Jain, opined, "Since, the committee had already been constituted by the State on 17.06.2020, we direct the respondent-State to place before the Court, the action so far taken by the said committee to prevent child exploitation and labour. Moreover, a firm and concrete action plan is also necessary to curb these activities. The high level committee constituted vide order dated 17.06.2020 is required to address these issues with the help of experts from various fields and if necessary NGOs who are already involved in protection of children." On perusal of the state's report, the court observed that a number of child labourers were found in police action and were later rescued. Large number of criminal cases have also been registered against those involved in child trafficking and exploitation of children in various small/large scale industrial and commercial activities. The court found that action has also been initiated where a child labour were found dead The division bench, while examining the reply filed by the state, said, "Further, it is also revealed that the child labours are being trafficked from other States of the country which are mostly those areas where because of poor economic condition and abject poverty, they become easily available for such exploitative practices. Obviously, this all is being done through organized activities where children from other States or within the State of Rajasthan are being trafficked and brought to certain areas to work as child labour in exploitative condition until they are rescued and rehabilitated." The court also compared the number of cases in other areas and observed that a high number of cases of offences against children in certain identified areas are being carried out by unscrupulous elements by deploying child labourers. In this regard, the court observed that the high level committee should focus on this issue and prepare appropriate action plan with the help of experts/NGOs to ensure that such exploitative child labour practices are put to halt. The court noted that allowing such activities to first happen and then taking action by registering offence is not enough. Appropriate action plan is required to be prepared and implemented to prevent such activities so that the children are not put to such exploitative practices as child labourers, added the court.. During the course of hearing, the respondent's counsel informed the court that she had filed two affidavits which highlighted that after rescue of children, the rehabilitation mechanism is required to take further steps which includes payment of compensation and rehabilitation of children and other rehabilitatory practices. As the court and the Advocate General were unable to find the said affidavits on record, the court asked the respondent's counsel to ensure that copies of the said affidavits are supplied in the office of Advocate General within a period of seven days. The court also directed the Registry to verify whether or not such affidavits have been filed and attach the same with the records of the present case. The court also granted three weeks time to Advocate General to respond to the averments made in the said two affidavits, if filed before the Registry. Moreover, the court also sought the action so far taken by the high-level committee along with a concrete action plan, as observed hereinabove, from the State on the next date of hearing. Mr. Gopal Singh Bareth-petitioner appeared in person. AG M.S. Singhvi with Adv. Siddhant Jain and Adv. Priyanka Mali appeared on behalf of the respondents. Case Title: Gopal Singh Bareth v. State Of Rajasthan     
The Rajasthan High Court has observed that any interference in rejection of grant of fresh application / renewal of license for firearms is not warranted except when extraordinary circumstances are pointed out by the party. In this regard, the court pursued Section 17 of the Arms Act, 1959 which talks about variation, suspension and revocation of licences. The present petitioner had raised grievance regarding the arms license. The court directed the petitioner to file a fresh representation within a period of 15 days and asked the respective District Magistrate to consider the representation afresh by passing speaking orders, while keeping in mind the existing policy of the State. Justice Vijay Bishnoi, observed, "This Court is of the opinion that any interference in rejection of grant of fresh application/ refusal/ renewal of license for firearms is not warranted except when extraordinary circumstances are pointed out. Looking into the submission made by learned counsel for the parties that it would be suffice if their rights are redetermined by the respondents, while keeping into consideration the judgment rendered in Khem Singh (supra), the same is accepted." In Khem Singh v. State of Rajasthan, the High Court had said that mere fact that some reports have been lodged against the license holder is not sufficient for cancelling the license. The court had added that a license can be revoked u/s.17 (3) of the Arms Act, if the licensing authority deem it necessary for the security of public peace or public safety. The court had also noted that in absence of any finding that cancellation was necessary for public peace or public safety, such an order is liable to be quashed. The petitioner was aggrieved by inaction and unjustified delay in issuance of arms license/ no opportunity of hearing given. It was submitted that though a case was pending against him, the same pertained to gambling and thereby did not impact public safety. Further, the petitioner's counsel submitted that there is a statutory provision for persons to apply and acquire a firearm license, and thus, the respondents ought to maintain maximum transparency, while passing the orders, whereas the impugned orders have been passed without making any individual consideration of the relevant criteria. The counsel for the respondents submits that there is no absolute right of any person to acquire an arms license and the respondents have every right to objectively decide each case, while taking into consideration the past record of the person seeking such license as well as the pendency of proceedings, if any. Adv. Lakshya Singh Udawat appeared for the petitioner while Dy. G.C. Ramdayal Choudhary and Adv. Ramdayal Choudhary appeared for the respondents. Case Title: Bhan Singh v. State Of Rajasthan & Ors.   (Raj) 195   
The Delhi High Court has observed that mere default in payment of rent as directed by the Court under Order XVA(1) of Code of Civil Procedure cannot, ipso facto, justify passing of an order striking off the defence of the defaulting tenant. Justice C Hari Shankar was dealing with a plea challenging an order dated 07th December, 2019, passed in a civil suit by the Trial Court in which the petitioner was the defendant and the respondent was the plaintiff. The impugned order adjudicated three applications preferred by the petitioner as the defendant under Order VII Rule 11 and sec. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under sec. 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Additionally, the impugned order struck off the defence of the petitioner, purportedly in exercise of jurisdiction under the proviso to Order XV-A(1) of the CPC. The petitioner was before the High Court assailing all four decisions as contained in the impugned order. The suit was filed by the respondent against the petitioner, seeking eviction of the petitioner from the premises of the respondent. The respondent's case in the suit was that the petitioner was the respondent's tenant vide lease deed dated 22nd February, 2017, followed by a rent agreement for a further period executed on 04th January, 2018. On the petitioner failing to vacate the premises despite the expiry of tenancy as so extended, the respondent filed civil suit against the petitioner seeking possession, permanent injunction and damages. In the application under Order VII Rule 11, CPC proceedings, the petitioner filed an application under Order VII, Rule 11, submitting that the respondent had concealed a lease deed dated 18th November, 2018, and that, if the lease deed were taken into account, the plaint would be liable to be dismissed. The Trial Court had held that an application under Order VII Rule 11, could be decided only on the basis of the averments contained in the plaint, and averments contained in the written statement or documents that the defendant sought to place on record could not be taken into account while adjudicating an application under Order VII, Rule 11. The High Court reiterated its findings in a recent decision in the case titled Madho Singh Chauhan v. Smriti wherein it was observed that an order for striking off of the petitioners' defence under Order XVA (1) is statutorily subject to Order XVA(2).  "Read in conjunction, mere default in payment of rent as directed by the Court under Order XVA(1) cannot, ipso facto, justify passing of an order striking off the defence of the defaulting tenant," the Court observed.  It further said that the Court is statutorily bound, under Order XVA (2) to, prior to passing of an order striking off the defence, serve a notice on the defaulting tenant, to show cause as to why the defence should not be struck off and, to consider the cause, if any, shown by the tenant in that regard.  "This is an exercise which, having been statutorily incorporated in public interest and in the interests of compliance with the principles of natural justice and fair play, has to be treated as mandatory and non-negotiable," the Court said.  The Court added that for non-compliance with the provisions of Order XVA(2), the impugned order which struck off the petitioners' defence could not be sustained having been taken without following the discipline envisaged in Order XVA (2). Accordingly, the impugned order was quashed by the Court.  In view of the above, the application of the respondent filed under Order XVA for striking of the petitioners' defence, was remanded to the Trial Court to further proceed with it in accordance with law.  "The petition stands accordingly partly allowed in the aforesaid terms with no orders as to costs," it said.  Case Title: RASHI MISRA v. B KALYANA RAMAN    
The Supreme Court has set aside a judgment delivered by the Bombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench) which had quashed a notification issued by the Maharashtra Government to reserve the post of Mayor in Dhule Municipal Corporation to candidate belonging to Other Backward Class (OBC) category.The High Court, in its judgment delivered on May 7 this year, had observed that the OBC reservation... The Supreme Court has set aside a judgment delivered by the Bombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench) which had quashed a notification issued by the Maharashtra Government to reserve the post of Mayor in Dhule Municipal Corporation to candidate belonging to Other Backward Class (OBC) category. The High Court, in its judgment delivered on May 7 this year, had observed that the OBC reservation was repeated for the second term without providing reservation for Scheduled Caste and hence it violation the policy of rotation. Disagreeing with the High Court's opinion, the Supreme Court observed that given the number of municipal corporations in the State of Mahrashstra, it was possible that there will be repeat of OBC reservation in Mayor post even before the turn for SC reservation occurs, and this by itself cannot be termed as violation of rotation policy as per the Maharashtra law. The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai referred to Article 243T of the Constitution (which stipulations reservation of seats in municipalities), Section 19 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations  Act, 1949 and Rule 3 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (Reservation of Offices of Mayors) Rules, 2006. The Supreme Court noted that there are 27 posts of mayors in municipal corporations in the State of Maharashtra. 1 is reserved for Scheduled Tribes, 3 are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 7 are reserved for Backward Class. From 2003 to 2017, the Office of  Mayor of the Dhule Corporation was reserved for Backward Class category for two terms (2006 and 2014), out of the total 7 terms. When the draw of lots for the SC reservation was done after 2019 elections, Dhule Municipality was considered. However, in the said draw of lots, 3 other Corporations got selected for SC reservation. As far as OBC reservation is concerned, the draw of lots was done from the pool of 16 Corporations after excluding the 7 Corporations which were reserved for Backward Class of Citizens in the immediately preceding term and the 4 Corporations which were reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Supreme Court said that the High Court's view that until reservation is provided to each category by rotation  same reservation cannot be applied twice was untenable. "... taking into consideration the fact that the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes are 3 whereas for Backward Class of Citizens, they are 7 i.e. more than twice, it is quite probable that the post of Mayor could be reserved for two earlier terms for Backward Class of Citizens and whereas no reservation is provided for Scheduled Castes", the Court observed. It said that to interpret the Rule in a manner that until reservation is provided for each category by rotation, the said office cannot be reserved for a category for which it was already reserved, will be to defeat the legislative intent. "We find that such a situation is bound to occur in view of the difference in number of seats, reserved for Scheduled Castes and Backward Class of Citizens. If the interpretation as placed is to be accepted then unless the post of Mayor is reserved for Scheduled Tribes in all the Corporations to complete the rotation, it will not be possible to provide reservation for the categories which were already reserved earlier", the judgment authored by Justice Gavai stated. Court has to prefer an interpretation which makes the statute workable The Supreme Court observed in its judgment that the Court must prefer an interpretation which makes a statute workable.  "The interpretation which gives effect to the intention of the legislature, will have to be preferred. The interpretation which brings about the effect of result, will have to be preferred than the one which defeats the purpose of the enactment", Justice Gavai wrote in the judgment. "At the cost of repetition and particularly taking into consideration the difference in number of seats for Scheduled Castes and Backward Class of Citizens, we find that the interpretation as placed by the High Court, would not make the said Rules workable and give effect to the legislative intent. It would have been a different matter that even after completion of the cycle, requisite reservation as per the Rules is not provided to the Scheduled Castes and excessive reservation is provided for Backward Class of Citizens. Such is not the case", the judgment added. In this connection, the Court noted that the Dhule Municipality was in the zone of consideration for SC reservation but it failed in the draw of lots. Only after that, it was included in the OBC reservation poll. It had to be included in the OBC pool, given the number of municipalities available. Reliance on Karnataka High Court judgment wrong The High Court had relied on a judgment passed by the Karnataka High Court in the case M. Abdul Azeez v. State of Karnataka and Others, which held that repeated reservation to particular category before other categories are given allotment was a violation of rotation policy. In this regard, the Supreme Court noted that the Karanata Rules were different from the Maharashtra Rules as they provided that the reservation can be repeated only after a cycle was complete.

The Karnataka High Court has said that a tender inviting authority is empowered only to cancel the tender prior to notification of award and execution of the contract. Once the award is notified, it is statutorily impermissible to withdraw or cancel the tender except for violation of the tender conditions, said the court.  Justice M Nagaprasanna allowed the petition filed by M/s Allengers Medical Systems Limited and directed Karnataka State Medical Supplies Corporation Limited to issue purchase order for portable X-ray machines in favour of the company pursuant to the Tender Notification dated 27-10-2021 and award of tender in its favour, within 2 weeks.  The bench said, “Once the award is notified and contract is executed it becomes a concluded process of tender. The tender then can be cancelled only on violation of conditions of agreement or award by the tenderer. Any unilateral cancellation of tender in the midstream or after execution of the contract cannot be countenanced, more particularly, when the contracting authority is a State under Article 12 of the Constitution of India.”  In 2021, the Corporation issued a notice inviting tenders for procurement of 100mA Portable X-ray machines. The petitioner submitted the tender along with other bidders.   After scrutiny by the Tender Scrutiny Committee, the petitioner was declared to be technically qualified and later emerged as the successful bidder. Later, a notification was issued by the Corporation notifying the award of contract in favour of the petitioner on 02-03-2022.  Pursuant to the notification of award, an agreement was signed between the parties and thereafter, a demand draft for supply of 165 Portable X-ray machines of 100mA was submitted by the petitioner for issuance of purchase order and a separate agreement for such purchase was also entered into between the parties. In spite of all these, no purchase order was issued as was required, in terms of the tender notification and the agreement entered into between the parties.  The petitioner approached the court and on issuance of notice. the corporation issued a communication dated November 3, 2022, informing about cancellation of tender order. It argued that that in the hope of getting a purchase order, it has procured all the machines and kept ready for them distribution and has spent several lakhs in the process.  The government defended its action by saying that if there is fraud involved in a tender, the tender can be cancelled at any time. It claimed there are certain charges of corruption in the declaration of the petitioner to be the successful bidder, which came to light later and owing to the complaint, a decision was taken to cancel the tender.  However, it was admitted that the petitioner was declared to be the successful bidder and a contract was also entered into for the purpose of distribution of portable x-ray machines with the petitioner.  The bench said if there are corruption charges against officers of the Tender Scrutiny Committee, it is for the appropriate authority to take action. It cannot result in cancellation of a valid tender, it added  “A notice inviting tender can be withdrawn or cancelled only upto a particular stage. Once it crosses the said stage, any unilateral cancellation would be an arbitrary muexercise of power," said the court.  Observing that Article 14 of the Constitution of India mandates that every action of the State should pass through the golden thread of non-arbitrariness, the court said the Corporation is a State under Article 12 of the Constitution of India.  “Being a State it would not behove of the 2nd respondent to act arbitrarily," said the court.   The court said the cancelling of the tender — after the tender process was concluded, award was notified and contract was signed with the petitioner — "would amount to arbitrary exercise of power and violative of tenets of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.”  Case Title: M/s Allengers Medical Systems Ltd And State of Karnataka  Case No: WRIT PETITION No.17634 OF 2022   Date of Order: 25--01-2023  Appearance: Advocate K Satish for petitioner.

The Supreme Court observed that repeated filing of cases and complaints against a spouse can amount to 'cruelty' for the purpose of granting divorce under Hindu Marriage Act. The bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy, in a case, referred to such conducts, even if they were subsequent to filing of the divorce petition, to grant divorce to a 'husband' on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage and the ground of cruelty. In this case, the 'wife' left the company of the 'husband' on the first day of marriage itself.  As she refused his plea to live with him, the husband issued notice seeking divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.  Later, the Trial Court, allowed his divorce petition, on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. The appellate court set aside the decree of divorce while allowing the petition filed by wife for restitution of conjugal rights. The High Court restored the decree of divorce, allowing the appeal filed by husband. The wife filed review petition inter alia on the ground that it was not within the jurisdiction of the High Court or the trial court to grant a decree of divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. The same was allowed. The court noticed that, after filing of divorce petition, the wife had (1) resorted to filing multiple cases in courts (2) approached the High Court to initiate disciplinary action against the husband, who was working as an Asst. Professor  (3) made representations to the college authorities seeking initiation of disciplinary proceedings against him (4) sought information about her husband's remarriage or whether he was living with somebody else, well known to her, and the proceedings were found to be an abuse of the process of the RTI Act (5) lodged a criminal complaint against him under Section 494 IPC (6) complained to the his employer threatening to file a criminal complaint against him, etc. "These continuing acts of the respondent would amount to cruelty even if the same had not arisen as a cause prior to the institution of the petition, as was found by the Trial Court. This conduct shows disintegration of marital unity and thus disintegration of the marriage. In fact, there was no initial integration itself which would allow disintegration afterwards. The fact that there have been continued allegations and litigative proceedings and that can amount to cruelty is an aspect taken note of by this court", the court observed. The following observations have been made in the judgment: Irretrievable breakdown of marriage  "In appropriate cases, this court has granted decrees of divorce exercising its unique jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, to do complete justice between the parties. Such a course is being followed in varied kinds of cases, for instance where there are inter se allegations between the parties, in order to put a quietus to the matter, the parties withdraw these allegations and by mutual consent, this court itself grants divorce. There are also cases where the parties accept that there is an irretrievable breakdown of marriage and themselves request for a decree of divorce. One of the more difficult situations is where, in the opinion of the court, there is irretrievable breakdown of marriage but only one of the parties is willing to acknowledge the same and accept divorce on that account, while the other side seeks to oppose it even if it means carrying on with the marriage". legislature's reluctance to introduce irretrievable breakdown as a ground for divorce 6. The ground which is often taken to oppose such a decree of divorce, apart from the absence of legislative mandate, is that the very institution of marriage is distinctly understood in different countries. Under the Hindu Law, it is sacramental in character and is supposed to be an eternal union of  two people - society at large does not accept divorce, given the heightened importance of marriage as a social institution in India. Or at least, it is far more difficult for women to retain social acceptance after a decree of divorce. This, coupled with the law's failure to guarantee economic and financial security to women in the event of a breakdown of marriage; is stated to be the reason for the legislature's reluctance to introduce irretrievable breakdown as a ground for divorce – even though there may have been a change in social norms over a period of time. Not all persons come from the same social background, and having a uniform legislative enactment is thus, stated to be difficult. It is in these circumstances that this court has been exercising its jurisdiction, despite such reservations, under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Families are arranged on the idea of a mutual expectation of support and amity 7. A marriage is more than a seemingly simple union between two individuals. As a social institution, all marriages have legal, economic, cultural, and religious ramifications. The norms of a marriage and the varying degrees of legitimacy it may acquire are dictated by factors such as marriage and divorce laws, prevailing social norms, and religious dictates. Functionally, marriages are seen as a site for the propagation of social and cultural capital as they help in identifying kinship ties, regulating sexual behaviour, and consolidating property and social prestige. Families are arranged on the idea of a mutual expectation of support and amity which is meant to be experienced and acknowledged amongst its members. Once this amity breaks apart, the results can be highly devastating and stigmatizing. The primary efects of such breakdown are felt especially by women, who may find it hard to guarantee the same degree of social adjustment and support that they enjoyed while they were married Pendency of the reference The court noticed that a constitution bench is yet to examine the reference in Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan in which issues raised are: (a) what could be the broad parameters for exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to dissolve the marriage between consenting parties without referring the parties to the family court to wait for the period prescribed under Section 13-B of the Act, and (b) whether the exercise of such jurisdiction under Article 142 should be made at all or whether it should be left to be determined on the facts of each case. We are conscious that the Constitution Bench is examining the larger issue but that reference has been pending for the last five years. Living together is not a compulsory exercise. But marriage is a tie between two parties. If this tie is not working under any circumstances, we see no purpose in postponing the inevitability of the situation merely because of the pendency of the reference The court noticed, in spite of this reference, that there have been various instances where the court has exercised its powers to grant divorce in such circumstances. The case at hand, the court said, is not covered by the questions referred to constitution bench.   
The Karnataka High Court has held that it cannot interfere with criminal proceedings initiated by the Directorate of Enforcement in Mumbai merely on the ground that the accused is staying and operating a bank account in Karnataka. A single judge bench of Justice K Natarajan dismissed the petition filed by Vihaan Direct Selling India Private Limited which had approached the Court seeking to quash the case registered in 2013 by the Enforcement Directorate and to declare that the search conducted under Section 17 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act as illegal and unconstitutional.  The bench said “This Court cannot interfere and pass any order with the action taken by the respondent-ED in the case registered at Mumbai.”  The ED had registered the case based upon the FIR registered by the Oshiwara Police Station, Mumbai in 2013 for various IPC offences including Sections 120B and 420 of IPC which are the scheduled offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.  The ED then conducted a search and froze the bank account of the company and sent the seized amount and other materials to the Adjudicating Authority. The bank accounts were in Bengaluru and Chennai. Petitioner's argument The company argued that the predicate offence registered by the Mumbai Police in Crime No.316/2013 has been stayed by the Supreme Court on 27.03.2017. When the predicate offence is already stayed by the Supreme Court, the ED has no authority to proceed with its investigation and seize any documents in the PMLA case.  Further, the company is suffering heavy loss and is in need to access to bank accounts to pay salaries and meet other running expenses and tax dues. However, the special counsel for ED, Madhukar Deshpande contended that the petitioner is not maintainable before Karnataka HC since the predicate offence and the ED case are registered at Mumbai. The court placed reliance on Madras High Court judgment in the case of S. Ilanahai vs. The State of Maharashtra in Criminal.O.P.No.22498/2014 and M.P.No.1/2014 reported in 2015 (1) MWN (Cr.) 618 and Delhi High Court judgment in the case of Sayed Mohd. Masood vs.Union of India and Another reported in 2013 SCC OnLine Del 4510. It then said “The judgment of the Madras High Court and the Delhi High Court categorically held that when the FIR is registered in some other State, merely the petitioner-accused staying in Karnataka State and bank account is operating at Karnataka, this Court cannot take the cognizance and quash or stay the criminal proceedings in favour of the petitioner.”  Thus it held “I am in respectful agreement with the decision rendered by the Madras High Court as well as the Delhi High Court that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition and pass any order against the respondent-ED when the case was registered at Mumbai and properties were seized and forwarded to the Adjudicating Authority at Delhi.”  It added “The only option available to the petitioner is to approach the Mumbai Court having territorial jurisdiction and also an alternative and efficacy remedy available before the Adjudicating Authority at Delhi.” Case Title: Vihaan Direct Selling India Private Limited And The Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement  Case No: WRIT PETITION NO.2576 OF 2023  Date of Order: 28-02-2023 Appearance: Senior Advocate Kiran S Javali for Advocate Shreehari for petitioner.

The Supreme Court has observed that while issuing an interlocutory direction at an interim stage while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the High Court must furnish reasons. "Even at the interim stage, the High Court must demonstrate an application of mind and furnish reasons for issuing any interlocutory direction, which is capable of being tested before this Court in an appropriate case", a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna observed. The Supreme Court was considering the case Jitul Jentilal Kotecha vs State of Gujarat which was an appeal against a judgment of the Gujarat High Court which quashed criminal proceedings exercising powers under Section 482 CrPC. In its interim order dated 2 May 2016, the High Court allowed the investigation to continue against the accused but directed that the final report cannot be submitted to the Magistrate without its permission. The Supreme Court took a critical view of the fact that the High Court's interim direction was not supported by any reason. "The direction was not supported by any reasoning whatsoever", the Supreme Court noted. "The interim direction amounted to an unnecessary interference in the investigative process envisaged under the CrPC. The High Court transgressed the scope of the powers conferred upon it by restricting the police from submitting the charge-sheet before the Magistrate and by further perusing the contents of the "draft charge-sheet" in the proceedings before it", the Supreme Court noted.  In this case, an FIR was registered against the accused under Sections 465, 467, 468 and 120B of the IPC by the Gandhigram Police Station, Rajkot on a complaint. In a petition filed under Section 482 CrPC filed by some of the accused, the High Court directed that the investigation may continue but the charge-sheet be filed only with its permission. A draft charge-sheet was placed before the High Court for offences punishable under Sections 385, 389, 418, 477, 506 (2), 120B and 34 of the IPC. Taking note of the contents of draft charge sheet, the High Court quashed the FIR against some of the accused.The Supreme Court further held that the High Court could not have quashed the proceedings on the basis of a "draft charge sheet". "...the High Court cannot place reliance on a "draft charge-sheet" which is yet to be placed before the Magistrate to quash the criminal proceedings under Section 482", the Court said.

The Supreme Court observed that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal cannot recall orders passed by it invoking power under Section 254(2) of the Income Tax Act. Section 254(2) power is only to correct and/or rectify the mistake apparent from the record and not beyond that, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said. In this case, the ITAT allowed the Revenue's appeal and held that payments made for purchase of software are in the nature of royalty. The Assessee filed miscellaneous application for rectification under Section 254(2) of the Act. This miscellaneous application was allowed by ITAT by recalling its original order. This recall order was unsuccessfully challenged before the Bombay High Court The bench noted that while allowing the application under Section 254(2) of the Act and recalling its earlier order, the ITAT has re-heard the entire appeal on merits as if the ITAT was deciding the appeal against the order passed by the C.I.T. I "In exercise of powers under Section 254(2) of the Act, the Appellate Tribunal may amend any order passed by it under sub-section (1) of Section 254 of the Act with a view to rectifying any mistake apparent from the record only. Therefore, the powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are akin to Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC. While considering the application under Section 254(2) of the Act, the Appellate Tribunal is not required to re-visit its earlier order and to go into detail on merits. The powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are only to rectify/correct any mistake apparent from the record.", the court said. The court observed that if the Assessee was of the opinion that the order passed by the ITAT was erroneous, either on facts or in law, in that case, the only remedy available to the Assessee was to prefer the appeal before the High Court. Setting aside the High Court judgment, the bench observed: Merely because the Revenue might have in detail gone into the merits of the case before the ITAT and merely because the parties might have filed detailed submissions, it does not confer jurisdiction upon the ITAT to pass the order de hors Section 254(2) of the Act. As observed hereinabove, the powers under Section 254(2) of the Act are only to correct and/or rectify the mistake apparent from the record and not beyond that. Even the observations that the merits might have been decided erroneously and the ITAT had jurisdiction and within its powers it may pass an order recalling its earlier order which is an erroneous order, cannot be accepted. As observed hereinabove, if the order passed by the ITAT was erroneous on merits, in that case, the remedy available to the Assessee was to prefer an appeal before the High Court, which in fact was filed by the Assessee before the High Court, but later on the Assessee withdrew the same in the instant case  Case name: Commissioner of Income Tax (IT-4), Mumbai vs Reliance Telecom Limited Coram: Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna Case no. and Date: CA 7110 OF 2021 | 3 December 2021 Counsel: ASG Balbir Singh for appellant, Adv Anuj Berry for Resolution professional

The Calcutta High Court has recently come to the aid of a victim of human trafficking by observing that impairing chances of a successful trial cannot be a ground to stall the repatriation of the victim to her own country from protective custody.  Justice Jay Sengupta was adjudicating upon an appeal preferred against the decision of a Single judge bench order vid which the victim's application for being repatriated to her native country had been rejected on the ground that it would damage the chances of the trial in the case. In the instant case, the victim is a Bangladeshi national who was trafficked to India for the purpose of exploitation in the flesh trade. After her recovery on December 9, 2017, she had been kept in the protective custody at a Home. A case had been registered by the police authorities against accused persons under Sections 370, 371, 120B, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3, 4, 5, 7 of the Immoral Traffic Act. Thereafter, a charge-sheet was also filed by the investigating agency, though it was not successful in apprehending  the accused.  Opining that success in a trial cannot be a ground to stall the repatriation of the victim, the Court underscored,  "Success in the trial cannot be a ground to stall repatriation of the victim lady to her own country. Afterall, she is a victim in this case and while the accused are at large, the victim is languishing in protective custody." Accordingly, the Court set aside the impugned order and further directed that there should be no impediment in having victim repatriated to her own country. The concerned authorities were ordered to take necessary steps in this regard. Liberty was also granted to the petitioner to return to India upon carrying necessary travel documents and depose in the trial in question. Case Title: Shukla Mondal @ Sumi v.

The Patna High Court on Monday observed that in absence of any connection between the act alleged and the property recovered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, it cannot be assumed that those properties were acquired by the terrorist act.

The Patna High Court on Monday observed that in absence of any connection between the act alleged and the property recovered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, it cannot be assumed that those properties were acquired by the terrorist act.  The observation came by a single judge bench comprising of Justice Birendra Kumar while dealing with a petition filed by the family members of an accused person challenging the order of Designated Authority allowing ex post approval under sec. 25 of UAPA with regards to seizure of certain properties which were not connected with the acts so alleged against the accused.  About the Case  The timeline of the case dates back to the year 2012 wherein a case was registered under sec. 414 of Indian Penal Code, sec. 10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and sec. (1-AA)/(1-AAA), 26 (2) and 35 of the Arms Act.  It was the case of the prosecution that the accused Kundan Mundal along with other persons were reported to supply arms and explosives to Naxals. The police then noticed a vehicle entering into the lane wherein three persons from the vehicle managed to flee after seeing them.  However, nothing was recovered from the physical possession of the arrested persons but a pistol along with other accessories was recovered for which the accused could not show any paper. The police also seized some Naxal literature from the vehicle which the arrested persons later disclosed that they used to supply arms to the naxals.  When the police searched the house of Mandal the very next day i.e. 26th July 2012, certain items including laptop, cash, ATM cards, Pan cards etc were seized. Subsequently a third seizure was made in the case on 26th August 2012.  Letters were written dated 21st August 2012 by IO and Superintendent of Police seeking ex post approval of the seizure from a designated authority under sec. 25 of UAPA which requires a prior approval of DGP by IO making seizure.  The order dated 17th October 2012 by the Designated Authority cum Principal Secretary, Government of Bihar vide which the seizure was confirmed was challenged before the Sessions Judge wherein the Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal against the order of designated authority. Therefore, being aggrieved, the petitioners challenged the order before the High Court.  Observations of the Court The Court observed that while it was evident that the IO could exercise the power of seizure only if the offence under Chapter IV of the UAPA Act appears to have been committed, the Court held that no such offence was alleged against the accused person in the matter. Therefore, the exercise entered into by the IO in making seizure of property was wholly illegal and without jurisdiction.  "Section 25 of the UAP Act requires that the Investigating Officer must have "reason to believe" that any property in relation to which an investigation is being conducted represents "proceeds of terrorism". "The reason to believe" must be on the basis of specific, reliable and relevant information."  The Court observed at the outset.  In view of this, the Court observed that the police report submitted did not show any specific reliable or relevant information to form a believe that the property so seized were "proceeds of terrorism".  "In absence of any connection between the act alleged and the property recovered, it cannot be assumed that those properties were acquired by the terrorist act." The Court held.  The Court observed thus:  "To attract the mischief of penalty for being member of an unlawful association under Section 10 of the UAP Act, it must be established that the association was declared unlawful by a notification issued under Section 3 of the UAP Act. In the case on hand, there is no evidence that to which of the unlawful association the accused were supplying the arms. Hence, it cannot be ascertained whether that association was declared unlawful association or not. Likewise, Section 13 of the UAP Act which provides punishment for unlawful activities is, prima facie, not attracted in absence of identity of the unlawful association."  Therefore, the Court set aside the seizure exercise, order of its confirmation and order of the lower appellate court and ordered the release of the seized property in favor of the petitioners within 10 days failing to which Rs. 10,000 compensation would have to be paid to the petitioners for each delay.    
The Orissa High Court on Monday issued a slew of instructions/guidelines to the Director General of Police, Odisha (DGP) for compulsory registration of First Information Reports (FIRs), requiring him to forward the same to all the police stations of the State. Expressing disappointment over frequent cases of non-registration of FIRs by police officers, the Single Judge Bench of Dr. Justice Sanjeeb Kumar Panigrahi observed,  "It is essential that the police officer need to be sensitized for registering the FIR throughout the State when a complainant approaches the Police Station. It is further directed that strong action should be prescribed against the erring police officer including the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against them for whimsically not registering F.I.R." Factual Background  The petitioner had approached the Inspector-in-Charge (IIC), Astaranga police station in Puri district on 04.05.2022 for registration of FIR against the accused persons and seeking appropriate investigation thereon. However, the IIC trivially refused to register the FIR. Aggrieved by such non-registration of FIR, the petitioner approached the Superintendent of Police, Puri, by way of a representation dated 29.05.2022. However, the said representation is still pending with him. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that though he has handed over the said complaint copy to the said IIC, which has been duly received by him, but there is no endorsement or acknowledgement receipt or any stamp acknowledging the receipt to that effect by the police for which the petitioner is unable to show as to whether the copy the FIR has been received by the police station or not. Court's Order  After perusing the materials on record and hearing the counsel, the Court observed that some amount of 'institutional lethargy' has crept in to so many police stations of the State. It also expressed resentment that many police officers are refusing to register F.I.R. whimsically or due to some extraneous circumstances. Therefore, in order to sensitise the police officers, the Court directed the DGP to issue the following instructions to all the police stations of the State:  "a) Whenever a person comes to the Police Station with a complaint, the Officer posted at the Police Station shall compulsorily receive the complaint and endorse the complaint by way of a receipt or by way of stamp acknowledging the said receipt at that Police Station with time and date. The Police Officer shall further insist a photo copy of the said complaint to be given back to the complainant. b) While a prescribed format is not necessary, it is essential that the In-charge of the Police Station shall indicate the minimum information required to substantiate a complaint and shall suggest what supporting documents are relevant and can add weight to the complaint. c) The concerned official must be courteous to the complainant who approaches to the Police station and furnish a pen and a paper to the complainant, on request. d) The complainant may also be given a comfortable space to sit and write the complaint. e) If the person is illiterate, the complaint must be dictated by the complainant to the officer-in-charge who shall reduce the same in writing and dictate it to the complainant before it is signed and stamped by the officer. f) A copy (photo-copy) of the FIR filed must be returned to the complainant by the concerned officer free of cost." The Court directed that the contents of the order be circulated to all the police stations of the State by way of instructions from the office of Director General of Police, Odisha within a period of fifteen days. While concluding, Justice Panigrahi said that all the police officers, constabulary etc. need to be sensitized to be courteous to the public when they approach the police station and at least they should be offered a chair at the police station.
