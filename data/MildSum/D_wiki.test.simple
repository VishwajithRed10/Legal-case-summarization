While answering a reference, the Madras High Court Bench of Justice SS Sundar, Justice GR Swaminathan and Justice R Vijayakumar observed that the Registrar does not have the power to accept the deed of cancellation to nullify a deed of conveyance made earlier, when the deed of conveyance has already been acted upon. The court was answering a reference made by Justice S Vaidyanathan with respect to the maintainability of a writ petition against the Registration of a unilateral cancellation deed.  A division bench of the High Court in P.Rukumani and others vs Amudhavalli and others had observed that such a challenge by way of writ petition was misconceived. This decision, however, was contrary to the full bench decision of the High Court in Latif Estate Line India Ltd v. Hadeeja Ammal wherein the court allowed a petition seeking to quash the registration of cancellation of sale deeds. Thus, in view of the conflicting judgments, the matter was referred to a larger bench to decide whether the Registrar has the power to accept the deed of cancellation to nullify the deed of conveyance made earlier, when the deed of conveyance has already been acted upon by the transferee.  The court followed the dictum laid down in the case of Thota Ganga Laxmi and ors v. Government of Andhra Pradesh and the decision of the full bench of Madras High Court in Latif Estate Line India ltd v. Hadeeja Ammal and which has been followed in the recent decisions of the Supreme Court.  The bench thus held that a Sale Deed or a deed of conveyance (other than testamentary dispositions) that has been executed and registered could not be unilaterally canceled. Such unilateral cancellations are non-est in law and cannot operate to execute, assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest in the property, it held. The court also held that such unilateral cancellations could not be accepted for registration. Unless the agreement is mutual, expressed in the recitals, the Registering Authority cannot accept the document for registration. However, the factual allegations with regard to the acceptance of gift or the issue where the gift was acted upon or not do not come under the purview of the Registering Officer. Hence, the Registering Officer is not excepted to accept the document unilaterally cancelling the gift deed, merely on the basis of the statement of the donor or the recitals in the document for cancellation.  With respect to the maintainability of challenge, the court observed that the transferee or any person claiming under him/her was well within the right to challenge or nullify the registration before the high court and need not approach the civil court. At the same time, the court also held that an absolute deed of sale or deed of conveyance that was duly executed by the transferor may be canceled by the Civil court at the instance of the transferor under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act.   With respect to gift or settlement deed, the court observed that cancellation was permissible if the same was under Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act. The court also emphasized that while registering revocation of such deeds, the registering authority should be satisfied that there is an agreement between the donor and the donee that the deed shall be suspended or revoked upon the happening of a specified event, that does not depend upon the will of the donor. Such an agreement should be mutual and expressive and seen from the document. Thus, the authority should not rely on self-serving statements or recitals in the cancellation deed.

The Madras High Court in a recent judgment spoke about the need to show tolerance towards other religious practices.  The Court was dealing with a writ petition filed by a Hindu man challenging the permission granted by the Kanyakumari District Collector granted to construct a church, against which the petitioner complained of nuisance due to the use of loudspeakers throughout day and night. The Court started its judgment by noting that in the Preamble to the Constitution of India, 'we the people' had resolved to constitute India as a Secular Republic. Reference was made to Article 15(1), which says that the State should not discriminate against anyone on the basis of factors like religion and Article 51A(e) as per which it is the Fundamental Duty of every citizen to promote harmony and brotherhood. The Fundamental Rights and Duties were sacrosanct and binding on courts, which adjudicate issues relating to religion. Noting that the petitioner was a Hindu, Justice CV Karthikeyan observed : "One of the basic tenets to be followed by every Hindu is tolerance. Tolerance must be his own community or religion and in particular, to also to every other religious practice". The Court noted that a temple was also located in the same residential area. Considering this, the Court spoke about the need to maintain tolerance and the importance of the ideal "unity in diversity". "The petitioner should learn to live with everybody else around him. This country takes the pride in unity in diversity. There cannot be diversity in unity. The petitioner should accept the group of people living across, and around with him and he should also accept that people of various faith and various caste, creed and religion and given rights under the constitution. The country is a secular country recognising practice of religion.The petitioner cannot make compliant against the same". The petitioner said he was not heard prior to the permission being granted for the building. However, the Court observed that the Collector had examined all aspects and granted permission to put up the church or rather convert an existing house into a church.  The Court also observed that the District Collector may, by himself or through his subordinates, impress upon the person who has built the church that it is prudent to show restraint and that the use of loudspeakers may not be required for the God to hear the prayers. "Let the prayers be conducted in a gentle manner", the Court advised. The Court said that if the authorities succeed in impressing upon the person who built the church to practice tolerance and respect, "then sense and sensibility would prevail over pride and prejudice".

The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently held that criminal law set into motion vide Section 156(3) of Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.) without application of mind and for the unexplained delay in lodging the complaint was liable to be quashed under Section 482 CrPC.  Brief Facts of the Case  The Criminal Petition was filed to quash the Complaint against the petitioners as the allegations made in the complaint were improbable and impossible.  The 2nd respondent who was the defacto complainant filed a complaint under Section 190 and 200 Cr.P.C. whereby the Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance of an offence. Thereafter, FIR was registered and after completion of the investigation, the police filed the charge sheet.  The allegations against the petitioners were under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Section 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), Section 448 (punishment for house-trespass), Section 192 (fabricating false evidence), Section 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) read with Section 34 (common intention).  Previously, the 2nd petitioner had also filed a private complaint against the defacto complainant/ 2nd Respondent and her husband for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act (punishment for the dishonor of cheques).  The case of the petitioners was that the defacto complainant/ 2nd Respondent's husband was working as Chief Manager of Indian Bank, Tirupati. The petitioners had joint savings accounts and fixed deposits with Indian Bank, Tirupati, and several transactions were done with huge amounts.  Subsequently, the 2nd Respondent and her husband approached the 2nd petitioner and borrowed Rs. 50 lakhs on the execution of a demand promissory note dated 13.06.2010. On 20.07.2011, the 2nd Respondent and her husband jointly issued a post-dated cheque dated 08.09.2011 for an amount of Rs. 25 lakhs. The cheque was deposited for realization on 15.02.2012 which was returned for insufficient funds.  During the pendency of the said complaint against 2nd respondent and her husband, she filed the present complaint against the petitioners which was forwarded by Magistrate under Section 156(3) of CrPC to the police concerned for investigation.  As per the averments of the said charge sheet, the defacto complainant/2nd respondent was a housewife and her husband working as A.G.M. in Indian Bank; she had invested her savings and also the salaries of her husband in the properties at various places; accordingly, in the month of March 2010 she had planned to invest money in properties, hence, approached the accused No.1 to lend an amount of Rs.18 lakhs.  But the accused allegedly obtained forcibly the cheque of Rs. 25 lakhs. Subsequently, the accused had allegedly trespassed into the house of the 2nd Respondent and abused her in filthy language, and forced her to repay the loan amount.  The present petition was filed by petitioners to quash the said proceedings invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of CrPC, mainly on the ground that the allegations made in the complaint were improbable and impossible as the petitioner had departed from India to US 25.04.2012 and returned only on 06.01.2013 but the alleged crime was said to be committed on 17.06.2012.  Another incident written in the complaint was false since in the complaint, 2nd Respondent had alleged that the accused had forcibly obtained blank cheques and a covering letter of her signature in the absence of her husband, but in the covering letter, two signatures were affixed, both husband of the defacto complainant as well as her signatures.   Furthermore, in Section 161 CrPC statement to the police, the husband of the defacto complainant had admitted that they had themselves handed over the cheques to petitioners. It was submitted that the complaint was filed only to frustrate the criminal proceedings initiated by the petitioners invoking Section 138 of NI Act. The delay in lodging of the FIR or complaint should also be satisfactorily explained.   The petitioner relied on the case State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, in which it was held by the Apex Court that if the allegations made in the FIR and complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused and if the criminal proceedings is manifestly attended with malafide and/or where the proceedings are maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive, said proceedings could be quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.  The counsel for the respondent/defacto complainant contended that since the allegations made were very serious in nature, unless full trial took place, the truth would not come out. Furthermore, this was a second quash petition which was not ordinarily maintainable unless in exceptional circumstances.   Having considered the submissions, the court observed that the undisputed fact was that the 2nd petitioner had issued the statutory notice under Section 138 of NI Act to the defacto complainant and her husband. The defacto complainant had not mentioned anything about the disputes between the parties and she had not explained the delay in filing the complaint. Clearly, from the documents, it is disclosed that the defacto complainant only with a malafide intention to frustrate the proceedings pending between the parties, filed the present complaint.  "The Magistrate has also not applied his mind while referring the matter to the police on the same day, under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C., without considering the fact that the complaint is made nearly after 08 months of the offence occurred, which is contrary to the observations made by the Apex Court in judgments cited supra. Taking the material facts into consideration, the facts of the present case squarely fit within the purview guidelines passed by the Apex Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal's case and also the law laid down by the Apex court. Hence, the proceedings against the petitioners liable to be quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., by invoking the inherent power of the High Court."  With the above observations, the Criminal petition was allowed and the proceedings against the petitioners were quashed.

In an important observation, the Punjab and Haryana High Court last week held that the Forensic report forms the foundation of a case under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act and in case, the same is not there, the entire case of prosecution would fall to the ground.

In an important observation, the Punjab and Haryana High Court last week held that the Forensic report forms the foundation of a case under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act and in case, the same is not there, the entire case of prosecution would fall to the ground.  The Bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill observed thus while granting bail to one Vinay Kumar from whose possession, 7000 tablets of 'Clovidol-10 SR' (Tramadol Hydrochloride) were allegedly recovered.  Importantly, the final report/challan submitted in the instant case did not contain the FSL report and in view of that, the High Court came to a conclusion that without the filing of the FSL report, a case under the NDPS act could not stand.  The matter before the Court  After the alleged recovery from the accused/bail applicant, the police investigated the matter and thereafter filed a report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. before the trial Court on March 4, 2021, however, the final report of the police was not accompanied by the report of FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory).  Importantly, the prosecution in the instant matter failed to file the FSL report, even within the period of 180 days, which is mandated for filing of challan as per provisions of NDPS Act read with Section 167 Cr.P.C.   Therefore, when the said period expired on June 20, 2021, the petitioner moved an application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. for his release on bail on June 22, 2021 arguing that in the absence of the report of FSL, the challan filed by the police could not be said to be complete.  The said application was considered by the trial Court, however, it went on to dismiss the same vide order dated July 5, 2021, and therefore, the petitioner moved the High Court with the instant bail application, assailing the order of the trial court denying him the bail.  Importantly, the Punjab & Haryana High Court has referred this question - as to whether a challan filed without report of FSL would be an incomplete challan (in an NDPS Case)- to a larger Bench vide order dated September 9, 2020, passed in Julfkar Vs. State of Haryana [2020 (4) Law Herald3188] and the same is pending before the High Court. In the said case, the Court was deliberating on the following issue "Whether in a case under the NDPS Act 1985, a challan presented under Section 173 (2) of the Code of criminal Procedure, is an in- complete challan if presented without the report of the chemical Examiner/Forensic Science Laboratory"  Court's observations   At the outset, the Court observed that a case under the NDPS Act can only survive in case the prosecution is able to establish that the article recovered is indeed contraband and the same could only be established on the basis of its chemical examination, which is normally got done through FSL established by the Government.   "In other words, the report of the FSL forms the foundation of the case of the prosecution and in case the same is not there the entire case of prosecution falls to the ground," the High Court added.  However, the Court did take into account the fact that there are in fact some conflicting judgments of the Punjab and High Court, and the matter - as to whether a challan filed without report of FSL would be an incomplete challan - stands referred to a Division Bench and is still sub-judice.  Against this backdrop, the Court extended the concession of bail in terms of Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. to the petitioner, while also keeping in view the fact that the petitioner has been behind bars since the last more than 9 months and is not stated to be involved in any other case.  However, the Court did clarify that the prosecution would be at liberty to move for cancellation of bail/recall of the instant order, in case the reference made to larger Bench in Julfkar's case (Supra) is answered in favor of the prosecution.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside a Delhi High Court judgment which had directed the Delhi Police to consider certain candidates for police constable selection despite their criminal cases. A bench comprising Justices KM Joseph and S Ravindra Bhat took a critical view of the High Court's approach in adopting a light approach towards the criminal behaviour of the candidates on the basis of their young age and rural setting. "The High Court's approach, evident from its observations about the youth and age of the candidates, appears to hint at the general acceptability of behaviour which involves petty crime or misdemeanour. The impugned order indicates a broad view, that such misdemeanour should not be taken seriously, given the age of the youth and the rural setting. This court is of opinion that such generalizations, leading to condonation of the offender's conduct, should not enter the judicial verdict and should be avoided", the judgment authored by Justice Bhat stated. "Certain types of offences, like molestation of women, or trespass and beating up, assault, causing hurt or grievous hurt, (with or without use of weapons), of victims, in rural settings, can also be indicative of caste or hierarchy-based behaviour", the judgment added. The Court stressed that since the selection was to police force which is tasked with maintaining law and order and to tackle lawlessness, there should be maximum scrutiny by the selection authorities to inspire public confidence.  The bench observed that Courts exercising judicial review cannot second guess the suitability of a candidate for any public office or post and that the state employer has an element of latitude or choice on who should enter its service. The selection authority had declined appointment of some candidates on the ground that they faced criminal proceedings and in most of them, even charges were framed after which the cases against them ended in a compromise. They approached Central Administrative Tribunal challenging these orders rejecting their candidature. CAT allowed their applications and these orders were assailed before the High Court by the Police Department. While dismissing the writ petitions, the High Court took note of youth and age of the candidates and observed that their misdemeanour should not be taken seriously  Disagreeing with the High Court's approahc, the Supreme Court observed that the autonomy or choice of the public employer has to be given due weight as long as the process of decision making is neither illegal, unfair, or lacking in bona fides. It said: 26. Courts exercising judicial review cannot second guess the suitability of a candidate for any public office or post. Absent evidence of malice or mindlessness (to the materials), or illegality by the public employer, an intense scrutiny on why a candidate is excluded as unsuitable renders the courts' decision suspect to the charge of trespass into executive power of determining suitability of an individual for appointment.29. Public service - like any other, pre-supposes that the state employer has an element of latitude or choice on who should enter its service. Norms, based on principles, govern essential aspects such as qualification, experience, age, number of attempts permitted to a candidate, etc. These, broadly constitute eligibility conditions required of each candidate or applicant aspiring to enter public service. Judicial review, under the Constitution, is permissible to ensure that those norms are fair and reasonable, and applied fairly, in a non-discriminatory manner. However, suitability is entirely different; the autonomy or choice of the public employer, is greatest, as long as the process of decision making is neither illegal, unfair, or lacking in bona fides. The court also considered the issue whether in the event of exoneration or acquittal of an applicant/candidate arrayed as accused of various offences is a decisive factor for consideration of his or her suitability. The bench, in this regard, noted the observations made in Avtar Singh v. UOI. "Several judgments in the past had appeared to draw a distinction between "clean" acquittal of accused individuals on the one hand and those acquitted or exonerated on account of benefit of doubt. Similarly, where candidates were charged with grave offences involving moral turpitude as well as larger outcomes were examined",  the Court observed.    
The Delhi High Court has dismissed a plea moved by an ex-serviceman of Indian Army seeking appointment in a subsidiary company of Indian Railways, on the basis of the graduation certificate issued by the Army, as a Junior Assistant (Finance) under ex-Servicemen quota. The ex-serviceman Raj Kumar's argument was that since he was having the experience of "working in Administration / Accounts / Finance / Budget / Logistics in the Army", he has the essential qualification for the post of Junior Assistant (Finance). The qualification sought for by RITES for the post was B.COM/BBA (Finance)/BMS (Finance). The division bench of Justice V Kameswar Rao and Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta said the plea of the petitioner is not appealing for the reason that even if he has some working knowledge of Accounts and Finance, that would not really commensurate with the qualification and knowledge required for the post in question, which one achieves after three years of study "If the plea of the petitioner is accepted, then it shall mean that, for example, if the eligibility for a given post is B.Sc. (Chemistry), a candidate similarly placed like the petitioner would be able to seek equivalence of the Graduation Certificate issued by the Army with a Decree in B.Sc (Chemistry). That cannot be the intent of providing a Graduation Certificate." The court said the certificate issued by Army certifies that the petitioner has the qualification of Graduation without any specialisation. It added that the certificate itself states that "an ex-serviceman who has put in 15 years of service in the Armed Forces and having minimum qualification of Matriculation may be considered for appointment to the posts for which the essential qualification prescribed is Graduation." Kumar had joined Indian Army on April 27 in 1996 and retired on August 31, 2017 after putting in a service of 21 years and 4 months. Kumar had applied in RITES Limited on September 28, 2019 for the post of Junior Assistant (Finance) under ex-servicemen quota. RITES on November 18, 2020 issued a letter to Kumar stating that the request for consideration of his candidature to the post in question could not be considered. The letter was challenged by Kumar before Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). The Tribunal observed that "when the essential qualifications of a particular post were clearly mentioned in the advertisement, non acceptance of deemed graduation held by Kumar as being equivalent to such qualification, cannot be faulted with." Aggrieved by the same, Kumar had approached the High Court against dismissal of his plea by the Tribunal. Upholding the order passed by the Tribunal, the court rejected the plea as being devoid of merit. Title: RAJ KUMAR v. UNION OF INDIA & ANR.    
The Allahabad High Court has observed that once an application under S. 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 [Maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings] has been allowed and uninterrupted litigation expenses are being paid to a party to a matrimonial dispute, he/she cannot move transfer application on the ground of distance and financial stress.The Bench of Justice Neeraj... The Allahabad High Court has observed that once an application under S. 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 [Maintenance pendente lite and expenses of proceedings] has been allowed and uninterrupted litigation expenses are being paid to a party to a matrimonial dispute, he/she cannot move transfer application on the ground of distance and financial stress. The Bench of Justice Neeraj Tiwari observed thus as it took into account the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Abhilasha Gupta vs. Harimohan Gupta 2021 9 SCC 730, wherein the Apex Court had taken the view that once the application under Section 24 of Act, 1955 is allowed and the particular matrimonial dispute is at the verge of the final decision, the transfer application can't be allowed. The case in brief In the instant case, one Shalinee Dubey had moved to the High Court with her transfer application seeking transfer of divorce proceedings from the Family Court, Auraiya to a Court in Etawah, where she is presently residing.  It was her primary submission that she has already moved applications under Section 125 CrPC and under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act in Etawah, however, only to harass her, the opposite party/her husband had filed a Divorce Petition before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Auraiya.  Under such facts and circumstances, she sought direction for the transfer of the divorce case from Auraiya to Etawah.  On the other hand, the counsel for the opposite party opposed her application by submitting that during the pendency of the divorce petition, she had filed an application under Section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 seeking pendente lite maintenance and litigation expenses. It was further submitted that when the said application has been allowed and the opposite party is already paying the litigation expenses to her, there was no need to transfer the case on the ground of distance and financial stress. High Court's order At the outset, the Court perused the judgment of the Apex Court in Abhilasha Gupta (supra) and observed thus: "Once the applicant has moved application under Section 24 of Act, 1955, which was allowed and uninterrupted litigation expenses is paid to her, she cannot move transfer application on the ground of distance and financial stress. Similarly, in case the proceedings are on the verge of final hearing, any interference in transfer application would only delay the proceedings. Therefore, under such circumstances, no interference is warranted and transfer application is liable to be dismissed." Accordingly, the transfer application was DISMISSED. However, in case of threat perception, liberty was given to the applicant to move an application before the S.S.P., Etawah alongwith order of this Court for security for the date of appearance.  "In case, any such application is moved before the S.S.P., Etawah, he shall provide ample security to applicant or other witnesses on the date of their appearances before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Auraiya," the court further ordered.   
The Calcutta High Court on Monday observed that the benefit of family pension cannot be extended to a widowed daughter of a pensioner who was married at the time of the death of her father/mother.

The Calcutta High Court on Monday observed that the benefit of family pension cannot be extended to a widowed daughter of a pensioner who was married at the time of the death of her father/mother. The Court held that a daughter who became widowed after the demise after her father/mother does not possess any fundamental or statutory right to claim family pension. The issue in consideration before a Bench comprising Justices Harish Tandon and Rabindranath Samanta was whether a daughter of a pensioner who was married, but became widowed after the death of the pensioner is entitled to family pension. Answering in the negative, the Court observed,  "As the legislative intent is demonstrated, the scheme of family pension never included a daughter of a pensioner who was married at the time of the death of the pensioner..A daughter who became widowed after the demise after her father/mother does not possess any fundamental or statutory right to claim family pension. In the absence of any legislation in this regard, the benefit of family pension cannot be extended to a daughter of a family pensioner who was married at the time of the death of her father/mother. It will be unwise on the part of this Court to exercise its extraordinary or discretionary power to come to any inference contrary to the policy decision of the Government." Background  In the instant case, the Union of India had challenged an order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Kolkata dated June 16, 2016 vide which the Office Memorandum dated September 18, 2014 issued by the Ministry of Personnel, P.G. & Pensions, Department Of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, Government of India had been quashed on the ground that it is unconstitutional and opposed to public policy.  The concerned Tribunal had accordingly directed the authorities to continue disbursing family pension to one Ratna Sarkar by treating her as a dependent daughter of the deceased pensioner with arrears to be released within two months from the date of communication of the order. The pensioner, one Nitya Gopal Das was a driver of the Eastern Railway and he retired from service on superannuation on September 10, 1980. He was a railway pensioner and died on May 19, 1985. After the death of the pensioner, his wife Namita Das was a recipient of family pension from the Eastern railway. She died on May 5, 1991.  The widowed daughter was was married to one Hrishikesh Sarkar, but, he died untimely on August 3, 1993 i.e 2 years after the death of her pensioner mother Namita Das. Observations  The Court placed reliance on Rule 54 (6) of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 which envisages that a daughter shall become ineligible for family pension under this sub Rule from the date she gets married. Furthermore, the Rule also stipulates that family pension payable to a son or daughter shall be stopped if he or she starts earning his/her livelihood. "A conjoint reading of all the relevant office Memorandums of the Railways in the light of Rule 54(6) of CCS (Pension), Rules shows that it was the intention of the legislature that the benefit of family pension would be extended to an unmarried daughter till she attained the age of 25 years or until she got married whichever is earlier. Such benefit, subsequently was extended to a widowed/divorcee daughter of a pensioner beyond the age of 25 years", the Court observed.  The Court further noted that the legislature has extended the benefit of family pension to a child/children of a family pensioner on his/her demise under different circumstances as enumerated in the relevant rule. For instance it was note that a mentally retarded child is bestowed with the legislative blessings to have family pension throughout his life after the demise of his/her parent. But, such benefit is not extended to a married daughter. Extending family pension to a child in distress of the deceased family pensioner is a policy decision of the government, the Court stated further. However, the Court underscored that a daughter who became widowed after the demise after her father/mother does not possess any fundamental or statutory right to claim family pension. It was held further that the clarificatory Office Memorandum dated September 18, 2014 cannot be termed as discriminatory and unconstitutional. By the concerned office Memorandum it was clarified that the family pension should discontinue in those cases where it has been sanctioned in pursuance of those office Memorandums, but without taking into consideration that the widowed/divorcee daughter was leading a married life at the time of death of her father/mother, whoever died later and was therefore ineligible for family pension. I The Office Memorandum further clarified that it would be appropriate that in order to maintain equality before law family pension payable to such daughter should be discontinued. However, recovery of the already paid amount of the family pension would be extremely harsh on them and should not be resorted to. "The clarificatory office Memorandum dated 18.09.2014 which manifests the very object of family pension enshrined in Rule 54(6) cannot be termed as discriminatory and ultra vires the constitution", the Court held further.  Accordingly, the Court directed,  "The order dated 16.06.2016 passed by the Learned Tribunal in O.A. no. 350/01194/2015 is hereby set aside. Consequently, the Tribunal application is dismissed." Case Title: Union Of India and Others v. Ratna Sarkar    
The Kerala High Court on Wednesday suspended the conviction and sentence of Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal and three others in a case of attempt to murder. Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal had moved an appeal challenging the decision of the Court of Session, Kavaratti to convict and sentence him and three others to 10 years in jail in a case of attempt to murder. Faizal and the three other accused persons on Wednesday were convicted for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 448, 427, 324, 342, 307, 506 r/w 149 of IPC and sentenced by the Sessions Court to undergo 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs one lakh each on the convicts for attempting to kill Mohammed Salih, son-in-law of former Union Minister P M Sayeed, during the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. Subsequently, he has also been disqualified by the Lok Sabha Secretariat from the Lower House of Parliament. Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas observed that  It is necessary that purity in politics and, consequently, in democracy is required to be infused. The decriminalisation of politics is an essential requirement of every democracy. As a constitutional court, it is the bounden duty to advance the constitutional objectives, including purity in politics. However, those lofty principles cannot be the reason for denying the application of the principles of rule of law. The societal interest in averting an expensive election that too, when the elected candidate can continue for a limited period alone if the fresh election is conducted, cannot be brushed aside by this court. The societal interest and the need to have purity in politics and elections will have to be balanced. Therefore considering the various legal and other circumstances and the special features arising in this case, especially those relating to the second petitioner, this Court is of the view that the case of the second petitioner falls within the category of rare and exceptional circumstances. The ramifications of not suspending the conviction are enormous.  Hence this Court is of the view that the conviction and sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the second accused in SC 1/2017 on the files of the Sessions Court, Kavarthi, Union Territory of Lakshadweep should be suspended until disposal of the appeal. The prosecution case was that the accused along with 33 accused formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and caused hurt to Salih with weapons. When the matter was taken up hearing the previous day, the Counsel appearing for the appellant argued that the trial court judgment and sentence is against the law, facts and evidence. Faizal and others have averred that the evidence is "partisan/ interested" without any corroboration as the evidence consisted of the depositions of Salih and two other workers of the Congress party and the accused belong to NCP.  Submitting the weapons were not recovered, the appellants have said that the doctors had said that the injuries suffered were not life-threatening and cannot be caused by sharp weapons described by the witnesses. The injured and the other two witnesses do not have a consistent case and their evidence does not inspire confidence as they contradict each other on material points, according to the appeal. The Counsel further submitted that an application was filed on the previous day with respect to the production of Final Report which is pending consideration before the Magistrate Court. "The time, place of occurrence and the parties involved in this case are the same as that of the persons who are involved in the case subject to appeal. Therefore, this is a case in counter," the Counsel said while pointing out that when there is a case in counter, the case in counter has to be disposed of by the same judge concession. In an objection filed by the Special Prosecutor for the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, it was submitted that the Sessions Judge had analysed the evidence of the case from a proper perspective and found that the appellants are guilty of the offences and had imposed a proportionate sentence. It was submitted that the impugned judgement is perfectly valid in the eye of the law and does not call for interference. Further, it is averred that the assault on the defacto complainant was in continuation of an instance in which the appellants threatened a family of supporters of the Indian National Congress from voting in the election and that the turn of events would reveal that the appellants were trying to exert undue influence in the electoral process and intended to physically harm the political opponents. It was further contended that the incident which led to the registration of crime happened in connection with the general elections to the Parliament held in April 2009. The accused are leaders and prominent members of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the injured is a prominent worker of the Indian National Congress (INC)and son-in-law of a former MP and Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha. The Counsel also pointed out that the 2nd petitioner (appellant) is involved in several criminal cases and is facing trial in the case registered by the CBI. "The offence committed by the petitioners/appellants was a shock to the Lakshadweep society which is well known for leading peaceful life with a smaller number of crimes reported. If the petitioners /appellants who are prominent leaders of a political party, found to be guilty of attempt to murder by the Court of Sessions are released at this stage, the same will result in shaking the faith of people in the judicial process," the Special Prosecutor submitted.  It was submitted that the prayer seeking suspension of the accused persons' conviction is improper since it is well settled that the power available to the appellate court under Section 389(1) CrPC to suspend the finding of conviction shall be exercised only under exceptional circumstances.  Special Prosecutor further submitted that the 2nd appellant, who has become disqualified on account of the conviction and whose criminal bent of mind is well evident from the involvement in many cases may secure re–entry to the Parliament in case his conviction is suspended as prayed for. "Not suspending the conviction of the 2nd accused is drastic not only for the 2nd petitioner but also for the nation. A cumbersome process of election will have to be started and its exorbitant cost will have to be borne by the nation and indirectly by the people of this country" the Court said while passing the order.  Justice Kurian also noted that no dangerous weapons were found to have been used by the accused in the case and that the wound certificates did not indicate any serious injuries. The Court pointed out that as far as the 1st, 3rd and 4th Petitioners are concerned no specific reasons have been stated to suspend their conviction. The Court observed that the first petitioner has been terminated from his service as a teacher consequent to his conviction and the termination is personal to him, and as held by this Court in Ajith Kumar v. Central Bureau of Investigation, a conviction cannot be suspended merely because the accused will lose his employment. Further, no reasons have also been stated in the application for suspending the conviction of those accused. Therefore I find no reason to suspend the conviction of petitioners 1, 3 and 4. However, since they are sentenced to a limited period, their sentence is liable to be suspended pending disposal of the appeal, the Court observed.  Therefore the Court allowed the application in parts, as follows: (i) The conviction and sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the second petitioner as second accused in S.C. No.1/2017 on the files of the Sessions Court, Kavarthi, Union Territory of Lakshadweep, shall stand suspended until disposal of the appeal on condition that the said petitioner deposits the amount of fine imposed upon him within two weeks from today. (ii) The sentence of imprisonment of accused 1, 3 and 4, in S.C. No.1/2017 on the files of the Sessions Court, Kavarthi, Union Territory of Lakshadweep shall stand suspended until disposal of the appeal on condition that those accused deposit the amount of fine imposed upon them within two weeks from today. (iii) The petitioners shall execute a bond for Rs.50,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the Sessions Court, Kavarthi.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday acquitted a man of rape charges while noting that it would be incorrect to punish someone for the offence of rape if the promise to marry did not fructify due to the subsequent events, namely, opposition from family elders which is not attributable to the accused. The Bench of Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Bivas Pattanayak noted that the man/appellant was a young person and the marriage proposal didn't come to fruition due to the opposition from elders and therefore, it wasn't a case of sex on the false promise of marriage amounting to rape. The matter in brief Essentially, the Court was dealing with a criminal appeal filed by one Saddam Hussain directed against the 2015 judgment and order of the lower court [Additional District & Sessions Judge, Fast Track First Court, Islampur, Uttar Dinajpur] convicting him under Section 376 IPC and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for 10 years. The prosecution case as alleged against the appellant was to the effect that he cohabited with the victim girl, who was a minor, on the false promise of marriage and as a result, the girl became pregnant. However, when she asked him to marry her, he evaded the issue and refused to marry.  During the trial, the prosecution examined eight witnesses to prove its case. The defence of the appellant was one of innocence and false implication. In conclusion of the trial, the Court convicted and sentenced the appellant, as aforesaid. Thereafter, moving the High Court with his appeal, he argued that the victim was a consenting party and the Marriage between the couple could not fructify due to the resistance of the parents of the appellant. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that the evidence of record clearly established that the appellant had cohabited with her on the promise of marriage, however, the Court added, the initial cohabitation wasn't forceful as such allegation was significantly absent in the FIR. Further, taking into account the argument that the appellant had agreed to marry her but the marriage could not fructify due to the resistance of his parents, the Court observed thus "Hence, it cannot be said that the appellant did not intend to marry her at the time when they cohabited...Mere failure to keep a promise without anything more cannot lead to the irresistible conclusion that the promise had been dishonestly made from the inception." Against this backdrop, the Court concluded that it cannot be said that the appellant did not have the intention to marry the victim at the time when they cohabited but such marriage was not possible due to obstruction from elders in the family. Regarding the argument of the prosecution that the girl was a minor at the time of the incident, the Court found that she was above 16 years at the time of occurrence and therefore, the Court held, the victim had crossed the age of consent. In light of the aforesaid discussion, the Court set aside the conviction and sentence and acquitted the appellant of the charges leveled against him. Case title - Saddam Hussain v.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that merely because the parties are engaged and are meeting each other, it doesn't give any right or liberty to the proposed bridegroom to sexually exploit the fiancée without her consent.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has observed that merely because the parties are engaged and are meeting each other, it doesn't give any right or liberty to the proposed bridegroom to sexually exploit the fiancée without her consent.  "The petitioner cannot get any leverage to physically exploit the fiancée against the consent during the period intervening the engagement and the marriage," the Bench of Justice Vivek Puri observed as it denied anticipatory bail to a man who has been implicated in a rape case by his fiancée. The case in brief The Roka Ceremony of Petitioner (Prospective Bridegroom) and his fiancée (Victim) was held on January 30, 2022, and the date of marriage was fixed for December 6, 2022, with the consent of the family. On June 18, 2022, the prosecutrix was taken to a room in a hotel wherein despite her reluctance, the petitioner entered into a physical relationship with the prosecutrix and also made her videos. Subsequently, on July 17, 2022, the mother of the petitioner (Prospective Bridegroom) informed the mother-in-law of the sister of the prosecutrix that the petitioner is quarreling for the last two months at home as he does not want to solemnize marriage with the prosecutrix. It was the case of the petitioner that when his family came to know that the prosecutrix was having love affairs with other male friends, they decided to call off the marriage on July 2, 2022. However, her fiancée (Victim) lodged a case under Section 376 IPC against the petitioner alleging that he raped her on June 18, 2022. The petitioner's counsel argued that subsequent to the engagement, the petitioner and the prosecutrix had voluntarily visited the hotel and their names have been reflected as guests in the records of the hotel.  It was further contended that the physical relations were developed with the consent of the prosecutrix. Even subsequent to the occurrence, the WhatsApp messages were exchanged which indicate that it was a consensual relationship and therefore, no case under 376 IPC is made out. Court' observations  At the outset, the Court observed that the WhatsApp messages sought to be relied upon by the petitioner were subsequent to the occurrence and that there was a lack of material to indicate that as on June 18, 2022 (the date of alleged occurrence), the prosecutrix had consented to any such relationship. "The WhatsApp chat at a subsequent stage may have been exchanged on the score that the matrimonial alliance was existing at that point of time. However, it does not indicate that the act was committed by the petitioner with the consent of the prosecutrix. It is not borne out that at any point of time, the prosecutrix has voluntarily consented for the sexual intercourse and it is a case of a consensual relationship," the Court further remarked. Against this backdrop, the Court also took into account the fact that as per information derived from the mother of the petitioner, there was reluctance on the part of the petitioner to solemnize marriage even at the point of time when a physical relationship was developed.  "There is a lack of material to indicate that there was genuine intention on the part of the petitioner to solemnize marriage and the prosecutrix was the consenting party at the relevant time. In the peculiar circumstances of the case, it is not made out that it was a case of a consensual relationship...there is a categoric statement of the prosecutrix that the petitioner entered into physical relationship with her, despite her reluctance, refusal, and denial. The passive submission on the part of the prosecutrix to the act, cannot be construed as a circumstance to hold that it was a case of consensual relationship" the Court remarked as it dismissed the anticipatory bail plea.

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that an offence under Section 506 IPC (Punishment for criminal intimidation), if committed in the State of Uttar Pradesh is a cognizable offence.To conclude thus, the Bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi referred to a notification published in the U.P.

The Allahabad High Court recently observed that an offence under Section 506 IPC (Punishment for criminal intimidation), if committed in the State of Uttar Pradesh is a cognizable offence. To conclude thus, the Bench of Justice Subhash Vidyarthi referred to a notification published in the U.P. Gazette dated 31st July 1989, notifying the declaration made by the then Hon'ble Governor of UP that any offence punishable under Section 506 of the IPC when committed in Uttar Pradesh, shall be cognizable and non-bailable. The Court also noted that the said notification had been upheld by a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Meta Sewak Upadhyay versus State of U.P., 1995 CJ (All) 1158 and this decision was also approved by the Supreme Court in Aires Rodrigues versus Vishwajeet P. Rane (2017) 11 SCC 62. The case in brief Essentially, the informant/victim in the instant case moved an application under Section 156 (3) CrPC alleging that the applicant, one Rakesh Kumar Shukla had fired at him with the intention to kill him and when several persons from the locality gathered there, he went away threatening to kill the informant/victim. Pursuant to the directions of the CJM, Banda, an FIR was lodged and the probe was conducted by the Police and a charge sheet was filed by the police in 2007 against the applicant, u/S 504 and 506 IPC, which is currently pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda. Challenging this charge sheet, the Applicant (Rakesh Kumar Shukla) moved the Court with a 482 CrPC Application.  It was primarily contended by the counsel for the applicant that originally the FIR was lodged under Sections 307, 504, 506 IPC but during investigation, the allegation of commission of offence under Section 307 IPC was found to be false and only a case under Sections 504 and 506 IPC was found to be made out against the applicant, both of which are non-cognizable offences and, therefore, it was argued by him that the case against the applicant can only proceed as a complaint case. It may be noted that this argument was made by the applicant in consonance with Section 2 (d) of Cr.P.C, which states that a report made by a police officer in a case which discloses, after investigation, the commission of a non-cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a complaint. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that although in the first schedule appended to the CrPC, Section 506 is mentioned to be a non-cognizable offence, the Uttar Pradesh Government, vide a Notification dated July 31, 1989, published in U.P. Gazette, made Section 506 IPC as cognizable and non-bailable. Against this backdrop, the Court referred to Section 155 (4) of CrPC which states that where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable, the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that the other offences are non-cognizable. Applying the mandate of Section 155 (4) of CrPC to the instant set of facts, the Court concluded that since the applicant has been charged with the offences under Sections 504 and 506 IPC, one of which, i.e., the offence under Section 506 is a cognizable offence (as applicable in UP), the Case has to be treated as a cognizable one and has to be tried for both the offences in the manner prescribed for trial of cognizable offences. With this, the application was rejected.   
The Delhi High Court has rejected the petition filed by a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militant Abdul Majeed Baba, who is serving life imprisonment in a UAPA case, for transfer from Tihar jail to his native state jail in Srinagar. Justice Poonam Bamba however directed the Superintendent of Tihar Jail to ensure that requisite treatment and medical care be continued to be provided to Baba, who is 66 years old. Seeking transfer to Srinagar Central Jail, Baba had submitted that his health is deteriorating every day and his family members are unable to visit him from Kashmir. Baba, a resident of Jammu & Kashmir, is lodged in a high risk ward in Central Jail, Tihar. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the offences under sections 120B, 121A, 122 and 123 of IPC and sections 17, 18, 20, 21 and 23 of UAPA. His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court in February 2020. Submitting that being close to his family would help him recover better, the counsel representing Baba argued that rules 664 and 672 of the Delhi Prison Rules provide for transfer of prisoners on humanitarian as well as medical grounds. Abdul's application for transfer had earlier been rejected by Delhi's Lieutenant Governor on September 24, 2021. Baba's plea was opposed by the prosecution on the ground that he was a hard core militant of a banned terrorist organization JeM and had absconded during pendency of his appeal before High Court when he was released on bail.  The court was informed that Abdul remained absconding for a long time and repeated non bailable warrants could not be executed for a period of six years from 2013 to 2019. The prosecution submitted that a reward of Rs. two lakhs was declared for his arrest after which he was arrested from Srinagar on May 11, 2019.  There is every likelihood of Baba managing to flee from any other jail, considering his past conduct, the public prosecutor submitted.  "The petitioner being a hard core militant of banned terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) his transfer may have law and order repercussions in both, the transferring and thereceiving state. The petitioner's request for transfer to Srinagar Jail was rightly declined after duly considering the above facts and circumstances as well as the past conduct of the convict," the State argued.  Baba's counsel in response submitted that he could not surrender to the police as he was under constant treatment at a hospital in Srinagar. The prosecution referred to a security advisory issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs of September 2015 for shifting of high risk prisoners from the jail of one state or union territory to another jail of a different state or union territory.  Perusing the said advisory, the court noted that the government "has to be cautious" in transfer of high risk prisoners convicted in terror related cases taking into account the "security implications of such transfers in both, the transferring and the receiving state/UT." "No doubt, Rules 664 and 672, Delhi Prison Rules, 2018 provide that the prisoner may be transferred from one prison to another on medical and humanitarian grounds with prior approval of the State Government. However, in view of the above facts and circumstances and taking into account the apprehension of law and order repercussions expressed by the State pursuant to evaluation of the security risk in transfer of the petitioner from Central Jail Tihar, Delhi to Srinagar Central Jail, this court is not inclined to grant the prayer of the petitioner," the court said.  On Baba's concern regarding his ill health, the court noted that according to the report of the Medical Officer in Charge of Tihar jail dated September 6, he is being provided medical care and treatment. "The Superintendent Jail is further directed to ensure that requisite treatment/medical care be continued to be provided to the petitioner. Petition is disposed of accordingly," the court said.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has held that a person, who raises a plea of mistake in order to controvert any material produced before the Court, bears the burden to establish such mistake.  A Single Bench of Justice R. Subramanian therefore dismissed the plea of a woman, claiming that she is a Hindu and that she was mistakenly shown as a Christian in her school certificates.  The Bench also allowed the prayer made by the woman's husband, to declare their marriage a nullity, as it was based on a misrepresentation that the former is a Hindu.  The Court observed,  "the courts below were not right in placing burden of proving misrepresentation on the appellant and concluding that the appellant has not discharged the burden. Once the plea of mistake is raised, it is for the party pleading mistake to prove the same. The documentary evidence that is made available would clearly point out the fact that there was a misrepresentation with reference to the material fact namely, the religion of the respondent at the time of marriage."  Background  The Appellant in this case had sought a declaration that the marriage between him and the Respondent wife is null and void for violation of conditions under Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act.  He alleged that after their marriage in 2003, he found that the Respondent is a Christian and on making certain enquiries, he also discovered her school certificates and a Community certificate, indicating that she and her family follow the Christian faith. He therefore argued that the Respondent misrepresented their religion and obtained his consent by practising fraud.  The Respondent on the other hand submitted that she and her family were always Hindus. As regards the entries in the school records, it was her contention that they were made by mistake as her father did not accompany her for admitting her in school. She also produced a community certificate dated June 2005, showing that she is a Hindu Nadar.  Findings  At the outset, the Single Judge noted that there was plethora of documentary evidence available to support the claim of the Appellant that the Respondent was a Christian by birth and she was practising Christianity throughout her life. "This is evidenced by indisputable documents in the form of educational records," it observed.  The Bench noted that there is evidence available to show that the Respondent had applied for Community Certificate as Christian at the Office of the Tahsildar.  Further, the documents produced by the Respondent to show that she is a Hindu, being a Community Certificate stating her to be a Hindu Nadar, was obtained after initiation of the legal proceedings by the Appellant.  At this juncture, the Single Bench observed,  "It is admitted by the respondent that she has been described as a Christian in all her educational records. She would claim that it is a mistake. Once the fact that there has been such wrong description is admitted, it is for the person, who claims that the wrong description is a result of mistake, to prove the same."  In this backdrop, it held that the Respondent has not established the plea of mistake raised by her and various documents produced by the Appellant demonstrate that she has described herself as a Christian.  Before parting, the Bench also criticized the lower courts for ignoring the 'unimpeachable evidence' produced by the Appellant. It observed,  "The courts below had not appreciated the evidence, which are available on record. They had chosen to ignore very crucial documentary evidence which had resulted in their findings being against the documentary evidence that is available on record. I am constrained to point out that the lower appellate court had not adverted to the fact that the various documents particularly the official documents which are maintained by people, who are statutorily obliged to maintain such documents disclose that the respondent is a Christian. It had chosen to rely upon documents that emanated after the filing of the original petition. The claim of mistake has been left unsubstantiated."  Case Title: P. Sivakumar v. S.

Observing that the medieval notion of the wife being the 'property of the husband to do as he wishes, still persists,' the Bombay High Court refused to show any leniency to a man convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.  Justice Revati Mohite Dere held the husband's contention that his wife, by refusing to make tea, offered a grave and sudden provocation to be "ludicrous," "clearly untenable and unsustainable."  The wife, struck by her husband with a hammer for suspecting her character and refusing to make tea had eventually succumbed to her injuries.  "Such cases, reflect the imbalance of gender – skewed patriarchy, the socio-cultural milieu one has grown up in, which often seeps into a marital relationship. There is imbalance of gender roles, where wife as a homemaker is expected to do all the household chores."  Justice Dere further observed that the emotional labour in a marriage is expected to be done by the wife.   "Coupled with these imbalances in the equation, is the imbalance of expectation and subjugation, Social conditions of women also make them handover themselves to their spouses. Thus, men, in such cases, consider themselves as primary partners and their wives, `chattel'."  "This medieval notion of the wife being the property of the husband to do as he wishes, unfortunately, still persists in the majority mindset. Nothing but notions of patriarchy."  Justice Dere quoted from, 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For Chattel' by Margo Wilson and Martin  Daly: "By `proprietary', we mean first that men lay claim to particular women as songbirds lay claim to territories, as lions lay claim to a kill, or as people of both sexes lay claim to valuables. Having located an individually recognizable and potentially defensible resource packet, the proprietary creature proceeds to advertise and exercise the intention of defending it from rivals. Proprietariness has the further implication, possibly peculiar to the human case, of a sense of right or entitlement".  The court relied heavily on the testimonies of the couple's six-year-old daughter, an extra judicial confession to the wife's uncle and recovery of a blood stained hammer. The child had witnessed the incident, while the husband had told the uncle that he struck his wife with a hammer.   The trial court's judge had discarded the child's testimony as it was recorded 10-12 days after the incident.  Justice Dere noted that the child's statement may have been recorded five days after her mother's demise and her statement under section 164 of the CrPC nearly 15 days thereafter, but she hasn't buckled under cross examination. The trauma of a child losing a loved one in such a brutal way, will have to be borne in mind, the court said.  The child had witnessed her parents quarrelling, her father striking her mother on the head, cleaning the blood off her mother and taking her to the hospital thereafter.  "It will have to be borne in mind, first the trauma of a young child, aged 6 years on seeing her mother being assaulted by her father; the trauma of seeing not only the assault but of seeing her mother lying there for an hour, during which, her father (appellant) gave her mother a bath, to clean the blood and also cleaned the spot."  Jusitce Dere said that the man could have saved his wife's life had he not wasted an hour cleaning up the blood.   "If the appellant had rushed Manisha to the hospital, soon after the incident, possibly her life could have been saved and Rohini would not have lost her mother ."  Background   It was the case of the prosecution that 35-year-old Santosh Mahadev Atkar, a resident of Vitthal Hospital Servant Quarter, in Solapur district of Maharashtra would have frequent quarrels with his wife as he suspected she was cheating on him.   On December 19, 2013 at about 6:00 a.m the victim Manisha was leaving her house, without preparing tea, due to which the couple had a fight and Atkar assaulted his wife on her head with a hammer from the back.   The accused then gave his wife a bath and wiped the blood-stains from the spot, He took her to the hospital only thereafter. Manisha's condition was critical and she was unable to speak. She finally succumbed to her injurie on December 25, 2013.   On July 1, 2016 Additional Sessions Judge, Pandharpur convicted Atkar under sections 304 (II) of the IPC and sentenced him to 10 years in prison along with a fine of Rs 5000.   The court was hearing his appeal against conviction.   "Considering the overwhelming evidence on record pointing to the complicity, no infirmity can be found in the impugned judgment and order convicting and sentencing the appellant for the offences mentioned in para 2 hereinabove. The facts on record also do not warrant any reduction in the sentence awarded to the appellant. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed."  [Read Judment]

An order of termination referring to the FIR and case filed against the employee without conducting full departmental inquiry is bound to be stigmatic, the Gujarat High Court has observed today. The Bench comprising Justice Biren Vaishnav made this observation in a petition under Article 226 challenging the communication which terminated the services of the Petitioner. Accordingly, the Bench quashed and set aside the aforesaid communication.  Background  The Petitioner, an employee at the Gujarat Livelihood Promotion Company Ltd as a Taluka Manager was appointed on a contractual basis. In 2018 an FIR was filed against the Petitioner and other employees for certain allegations. Subsequently, the impugned communication was issued against the Petitioner, terminating her services. Notably, the Petitioner's appointment contract stipulated that employees could be terminated on grounds of misconduct, moral turpitude or cheating.  The Petitioner submitted that even though the employment was contractual, the communication was stigmatic and could not be passed without appropriate inquiry. To bolster this contention, the Petitioner relied on Union of India vs Madhusudan Prasad [(2004) 3 SCC 43] and in State of Gujarat vs Rahul Aydanbhai Vank [Letters Patent Appeal No. 841 of 2019] and other cases.   Per contra, the Respondent contended that the appointment contract stipulated that in case of misconduct or fraud, disobedience and so on, the services of the Petitioner could be terminated. The Respondent referred to the FIR lodged by the Taluka Development Officer for financial irregularities committed by the Petitioner basis which her services were terminated. To buttress this argument, the Respondent relied on Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation vs. Paramjeet Singh (2019) 6 SCC 250 wherein it was held that an employee who was engaged on a temporary basis, could be terminated without notice following the principles of natural justice.   Judgement   The Court identified the primary question as whether the impugned communication could be termed as stigmatic. To address this, the Bench relied on Niteshkumar Pradeepbhai Makwana vs. District Program Coordinator and Director [Special Civil Application No. 48 of 2019.] where the Gujarat HC had held:  "The authority has readily concluded that the petitioners were directly involved in the irregularities and that the petitioners committed financial defalcation and that they indulged into corrupt practice. This was a finding arrived at without holding any inquiry. A straightway finding was reached and the termination orders passed only on the ground that F.I.R. was registered. The order is founded on the allegation of misconduct and therefore, it is manifestly stigmatic. Such orders could not have been passed even though petitioners' service was under a contract in MNREGA Scheme."  This judgement was affirmed by the Division Bench of the Gujarat HC in LPA No. 1596 of 2019, as well. Further, in Dipti Prakash Banerjee vs. Satvendra Nath Bose National Centre For Basic sc., Calcutta [AIR 1999 SC 983], to address if an order is passed on a motive or foundation and whether it can be termed as stigmatic, the Supreme Court had opined:  "…we hold that the words amounting to 'stigma' need not be contained in the order of termination but may also be contained in an order or proceeding referred to in the order of termination or in an annexure thereto and would vitiate the order of termination."  Justice Vaishnav concluded that even though the order of termination did not refer to anything except the terms of the contract which could grant the Respondent the benefit to terminate the Petitioner, it was evident from the Dipti Banerjee judgement, that the material which amounts to stigma need not be contained in the order of termination but may contain in the documents referred to in the termination order or its annexures. Thus, by referring to the FIR and the case filed against the Petitioner, the order of termination became stigmatic. Accordingly, the Bench quashed the impugned communicated and directed that the Petitioner be reinstated.

"...no accused person is incapable of being reformed and therefore, all measures should be applied to give them an opportunity of reformation in order to bring them in the social stream," the Allahabad High Court recently observed as it modified the sentence of an accused convicted under Section 304 Part 1 IPC. The bench of Justice Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi further stressed that undue harshness should be avoided while sentencing keeping in view the reformative approach underlying our criminal justice system. The case in brief The bench was hearing an appeal moved one Babu, who was convicted under Section 304(i) read with Section 34 IPC and under Section 4/25 Arms by the Court of Additional Session Judge, Badaun in Mya 2013. The convict/appellant, along with co-accused Munna, was found guilty of killing Rani (deceased). As per the case of the prosecution, on April 20, 2010, the complainant (Kamlesh) was returning home with her mother Rani (deceased) after purchasing the vegetables. Both the accused came from behind and Babu put his hand on the shoulder of her mother, her mother gave a jerk and moved ahead, which annoyed Babu and he drove out a knife from his clothes and stabbed her mother in the abdomen. Both the accused ran away. Rani died later on. Before the Court after some arguments, the counsel for the appellant submitted that he was not pressing this appeal on its merit, but he prayed only for a reduction of the sentence.  He submitted that the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to the appellant by the trial court was very harsh. He also submitted that the appellant is in jail for the past more than 9 years. Court's observations At the outset, the Court noted that nothing had come out, which could give any benefit to the appellant. The Court noted that the knife, used in the commission of the crime, was recovered by the investigating officer on the pointing out of the accused-appellant Babu.  The Court further noted that the Medical evidence also shows that injury No.2 in ante mortem injuries, mentioned in post mortem report, is the injury that could be inflicted by a weapon like a knife. Hence, the Court observed that the ocular version of eye-witness PW2 was corroborated by medical evidence also. Consequently, while coming to the conclusion that the accused is the perpetrator of the offence, the Court considered the question as to whether the sentence of life imprisonment and fine was adequate or the sentence was required to be modified. The Court took into account the rulings of the Apex Court to state that while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment, the impact of crime on society as a whole and rule of law needs to be balanced.  Further stressing that the judicial trend in the country has been towards striking a balance between reform and punishment, the Court remarked thus: "The protection of society and stamping out criminal proclivity must be the object of law which can be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence on criminals and wrongdoers. Law, as a tool to maintain order and peace, should effectively meet challenges confronting the society, as society could not long endure and develop under serious threats of crime and disharmony. It is therefore, necessary to avoid undue leniency in imposition of sentence. Thus, the criminal justice jurisprudence adopted in the country is not retributive but reformative and corrective. At the same time, undue harshness should also be avoided keeping in view the reformative approach underlying in our criminal justice system." Further, the Court also noted that in the instant case, the sentence awarded by the learned trial court for a life term was very harsh keeping in view the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case and the gravity of offence. Hence, the sentence awarded to the appellant Babu by the trial court was modified as a sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment under Section 304 Part I read with Section 34 IPC and a fine of Rs.10,000/-.

The Supreme Court held that while rejecting a plaint under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of Code of Civil Procedure, the Court cannot grant liberty to the plaintiff to amend the plaint.The proviso to Rule 11 covers the cases falling within the ambit of clauses (b) and (c) and has no application to a rejection of a plaint under Order 7 Rule 11(d), the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR... The Supreme Court held that while rejecting a plaint under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of Code of Civil Procedure, the Court cannot grant liberty to the plaintiff to amend the plaint. The proviso to Rule 11 covers the cases falling within the ambit of clauses (b) and (c) and has no application to a rejection of a plaint under Order 7 Rule 11(d), the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed. In this case, the Trial Court permitted the plaintiff to carry out an amendment for seeking appropriate reliefs. Allowing the Revision petition, the High Court held that since the plaint was rejected under Order 7 Rule 11(d) there was no occasion to direct that an amendment be made to the plaint. Where the rejection of the plaint takes place under Order 7 Rule 11(d), there would be no question of granting time to the plaintiff to rectify the defects in the plaint, the High Court had observed. In appeal, the Apex Court bench noted the proviso in Order 7 Rule 11 and said that it  deals with a situation where time has been fixed by the Court for the correction of the valuation or for supplying of the requisite stamp paper.  13.....Under the proviso, the time so fixed shall not be extended unless the court, for reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that the plaintiff was prevented by a cause of an exceptional nature from complying within the time fixed by the court and that a refusal to extend time would cause grave injustice to the plaintiff. The proviso evidently covers the cases falling within the ambit of clauses (b) and (c) and has no application to a rejection of a plaint under Order 7 Rule 11(d). In the circumstances,  the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the further direction that was issued by the Trial Judge was not in consonance with law. In this case, the High Court had dismissed the writ petition filed by the plaintiff against the order rejecting the plaint.  "The definition of "decree" in Section 2(2) "shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint". Hence, the order of the Trial Court rejecting the plaint is subject to a first appeal under Section 96 of the CPC. The writ petition filed by the appellant was liable to be rejected on that ground.", the bench said while affirming the judgment of the High Court rejecting the writ petition.      
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that under the Motor Vehicles Act, mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of driver to drive at the relevant time are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either insured or third parties.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that under the Motor Vehicles Act, mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of driver to drive at the relevant time are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either insured or third parties. To avoid liability towards insured, the insurer has to prove that insured was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care.  A bench comprising Justice Vinod Chaterjee Koul was hearing a review of judgement passed by a coordinate bench of the Court in an Appeal. Perusal of the record revealed that Claimant who had faced injuries as a result of an accident had sought compensation to the amount of Rs.40 Lakhs before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Anantnag. The Insurance Co had resisted the claim petition before the Tribunal on the ground that the driver of offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence and without PSV endorsement thereon.  By virtue of an award, the Tribunal found claimant entitled to compensation in the amount Rs.4,13,000/- along with 6% interest per annum from the date of institution of claim till realization. Aggrieved of the said award, the Insurance Company filed an appeal which came to be allowed by a coordinate bench of the High Court , granting a right of recovery to Insurance Company. It was this order of which review was being sought.  The counsel for review petitioners argued that the High Court while passing the impugned judgement had not looked into the fact that the tribunal had lucidly dealt with all aspects of the matter, including one the driving licence inasmuch as the Tribunal had referred to law laid down in National Insurance Co. Ltd v. Swaran Singh and others (2004).   Counsel for the review-petitioners further asserted that since the judgement/order does not effectively deal with and determine the important points as were popping up in view of law laid down in certain supreme court judgements relied upon by review petitioner and referred to by the Tribunal, the omission appears on the face of the judgement/order, which would well be reviewed.  Contesting the petition counsel for appellant-Insurance Company stated that the High Court has rightly given the right to Insurance Company to recover the award amount from owner of offending vehicle. He also submitted that driver of the offending vehicle was not having effective driving licence to drive mini passenger bus at the time of accident as there was no PSV endorsement on his driving licence  Adjudicating upon the matter the bench observed that law is trite on the matter that a holder of driving licence with respect to light motor vehicle is competent to drive any light motor vehicle used or adapted to be used for carriage of passengers, i.e., a public service vehicle. Motor Vehicles Act does not prescribe bearing the endorsement of PSV (Passenger Service Vehicle) on a licence for driving light motor vehicle, the bench underscored.  Examining the matter in detail the bench placed reliance on the supreme court judgement in National Insurance Company Ltd v. Swaran Singh and others (2004) wherein SC held that insurance of vehicles against third party risks, as provided under Chapter XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, is a social welfare legislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents caused by use of motor vehicles and that provisions of compulsory insurance coverage of all vehicles are with this paramount object and the provisions of the Act have to be so interpreted as to effectuate the said object.  With a view to avoid their liability, the insurance companies must not only establish the available defence(s) raised in the proceedings but must also establish breach on the part of owner of the vehicle and that the burden of proof wherefore would be on them. Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of insured as regards policy condition concerning holding of a valid licence by driver or his qualification to drive during relevant period, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards insured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving licence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause of accident, the bench underscored.  Dealing with the contention that driver of the offending vehicle was not having effective driving licence to drive mini passenger bus at the time of accident the bench while placing reliance on Mukund Dewangan v. Oriental Insurance Company Limited reported in AIR 2017 observed that a person holding driving licence to drive light motor vehicle can ply the transport vehicle as well of such class and no separate endorsement to that effect is required.  Instant review petition was thus allowed and and the right given to Insurance Company to recover the compensation from the owner was deleted from the judgement.

The Delhi High Court on Friday held that the report of Public Prosecutor is not required to be provided to the accused at the stage of grant of extension of remand for continued investigation under section 43D(2) of UAPA.  A division bench of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Anish Dayal however said that when the accused is produced to inform him about the extension of period of investigation based on Public Prosecutor’s report, “the accused cannot be a silent spectator” and the Special Court would be required to take into consideration, submissions on behalf of the accused, while examining the report regarding progress of investigation and the reasons for seeking further detention.  “The Special Court would also be required to satisfy itself, from the investigation carried out that there is sufficient material to form a reasonable belief that prima facie an offence under UAPA is made out, though no reasons in this regard will be required to be reflected in the order as the same would entail disclosure of the investigation carried out,” it said.  As per Section 43D(2), in cases where it is not possible to complete the investigation within a period of 90 days, the Court may extend the period of detention of the accused upto 180 days. The court may do so on being satisfied with the report of the Public Prosecutor indicating the progress of the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the period of 90 days, as per the provision. The bench said that the Designated Courts should always carefully consider the material available on record and apply their mind to ascertain whether on the material collected by the investigating agency, provisions of UAPA are even prima facie attracted or not.  “This is all the more essential for the reason that in case the provision of UAPA itself is prima facie not attracted, the Designated Court has no jurisdiction to either grant the remand or extend the remand as contemplated under Section 43D(2)(b) of UAPA,” it said.  The bench also enumerated three essential ingredients to form part of the Public Prosecutor’s report, based on which the Special Court would arrive at the satisfaction to extend the period of remand. The elements are: - Reasons evidencing the personal satisfaction of the Public Prosecutor as regards the progress of investigation made based on the investigation carried out.  - Reasons indicating why the investigation could not be completed within the period of 90 days; and, - Further investigation required to be carried out for which, extended period of time is necessary. Whether report of the Public Prosecutor is required to be furnished to accused? Observing that a Public Prosecutor is required to carry out the said function fairly, impartially, objectively and within the framework of the provisions of the law, the court said that the Public Prosecutor has, at all times, to ensure that the accused is tried fairly.  “He should consider the legitimate interest and possible concern of the witnesses and victims. He is supposed to refuse evidence reasonably believed to have been obtained through recourse to unlawful methods,” it said.  It added that if the Public Prosecutor finds that the investigation has not progressed in the proper manner or that there has been unnecessary, deliberate or avoidable delay in completing the investigation, he may refuse to submit any report to the court to seek extension of time. “Issue No.I is thus answered in the negative and it is held that the report of the Public Prosecutor cannot be furnished to the accused at the time of extension of remand for a further period of 90 days under proviso to sub- Section 2(b) of Section 43D of UAPA,” it said.  Necessary requirements to extend the period of remand The court observed that before an order is passed by the Special Court while exercising the power under proviso to section 43D(2)(b) of UAPA, it has to satisfy itself that all the above four ingredients are complied with. It added that the Public Prosecutor’s report must indicate the progress of investigation carried out, that there was no unnecessary, deliberate or avoidable delay and what further investigation is required to be carried out by the State to file a proper charge sheet. Whether the period of remand should be extended in one go? The court said that a bare reading of the provision of section 167 Cr.P.C. and section 43D(2)(b) of UAPA uses the word “in whole”, thus, even if there is no bar to grant an extension for a further period of 90 days in one go, while granting the extension of time, it is incumbent on the Special Court to see as to how much further time is reasonably required to complete the investigation. “If on the facts of a given case, further investigation can be completed within a period of 30 days or 45 days, the Special Court will not grant an extension of 90 days, but for the said 30 or 45 days, subject to the right of the prosecution to seek further extension if so necessary as per the provision,” the court said.  The bench said that whenever extension is granted by the Special Court upto the total of further period of 90 days, the same has to be based on the fresh report of the Public Prosecutor.  “Such an approach will strike an equitable balance between the right of accused from not suffering meaningless continued detention without investigation and the right of the investigating agency to conclude the investigation fairly, covering all facets,” it said.  About the Appeals One of the pleas moved by Zeeshan Qamar argued that the proviso to Section 43D (2)(b) of UAPA establishes the threshold of impossibility to complete investigation within a period of ninety days. The plea challenged the trial court's order of granting an extension under Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAPA in his case. Qamar was arrested from his residence in Uttar Pradesh in September last year in an FIR related to existence of an alleged terror module. Another plea was moved by Mohd. Manan Dar, a Kashmir based freelance photojournalist, against a trial court order which granted an extension of 90 days under Section 43D(2) of the UAPA for completion of investigation. It also sought consequential directions for Dar's release on default bail under Section 167(1) of CrPC for the reason that the investigating agency failed to file a charge sheet within 90 days of his arrest. The court dismissed the appeals. However, the bench granted default bail to appellants Mushab Anwar and Rahees Rasheed under section 167(2) Cr.P.C.  “We place on record our appreciation for the assistance rendered by Mr.S.V. Raju, Mr.Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASGs, Mr.Gautam Narayan, Mr.Akshai Malik, Special Public Prosecutors, Ms.Shahrukh Alam, Mr.Jawahar Raja, Mr.Ashok Aggarwal, Md.Irshad Hanif and Ms.Tara Narula, Advocates,” the court said.  The appellants were represented by Advocates Shahrukh Alam and Ahmad Ibrahim, Tara Narula, Tamanna Pankaj, Priya Vats, Jawahar Raja, Varsha Sharma and Archit Krishna. Title: MOHD. MANAN DAR v. NATIONAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY and other connected matters    
After ordering Amazon to remove the listings of Pakistan-manufactured Rooh Afza from its platform in India, the Delhi High Court has passed a permanent injunction in favour of Hamdard National Foundation (India) restraining various sellers from offering the infringing products. Hamdard National Foundation and Hamdard Laboratories India (Hamdard Dawakhana) had earlier filed a suit against Amazon and some sellers which were offering the products of its Pakistani counterpart on the e-commerce site in India. Justice Prathiba M. Singh on September 5 had directed Amazon to remove the listings of infringing products from its Indian website within 48 hours and provide details of the sellers to Hamdard.  On November 11, the counsel representing the Plaintiffs submitted that since all the details of the sellers have been received and all the infringing listings have been taken down, the reliefs sought in the plaint stand satisfied.  "Considering the submissions made and the facts recorded above, the suit shall stand decreed in terms of paragraph 38(a) of the Plaint against Defendant No.2 as also the sellers mentioned above," said the court while ordering a permanent injunction against six sellers. The court further directed Amazon that in case any other listings infringing Hamdard's mark 'Rooh Afza' are found, the same be taken down in accordance with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which were amended this year. Introduced by well-known Unani practitioner Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majeed in Delhi more than a century back, Rooh Afza also became a victim of the India-Pakistan partition when his younger son decided to migrate to Pakistan and his elder son stayed in India. They started separate Hamdard companies - Hamdard National Foundation owns rights over the drink in India, Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) manufactures it in Pakistan. In September, the plaintiffs had told the court that three purchases made by through Amazon revealed that the products being sold under the 'Roof Afza' mark originated from Karachi, Pakistan. Justice Singh in the interim order on September 5 observed that Rooh Afza is a product which has been consumed by the Indian public for over a century now. "The same being a drink for human consumption, the quality standards have to comply with the applicable regulations prescribed by the FSSAI and LMA. It is surprising that an imported product is being sold on www.amazon.in platform without the complete details of the manufacturer being disclosed," the court had observed, adding that any consumer would confuse the Pakistani product as being connected or originating from the plaintiffs.

The Delhi High Court has observed that courts cannot substitute their view for the qualification requirements prescribed by an organization while advertising vacancies to a post. A division bench of Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela observed: "It is open to an organization while advertising its vacancies to prescribe qualifications as may be suitable, in the view of the Organization for appointment to the said post. Courts cannot substitute its view for the requirements prescribed by the organization." The bench thus dismissed a plea filed by one Priyanka Agarwal, who had applied for a post of Medical Physicist in city's Safdarjung Hospital under the unreserved Category, challenging an order passed by Central Administrative Tribunal dismissing her original application.  The essential educational qualification, as per the advertisement for the vacancies, was that the candidate must have a Post Graduate degree in Physics along with Post M.Sc. Diploma in Radiological or Medical Physics. There was also an additional requirement in the Ad that a candidate must have done an internship of minimum 12 months in a recognised well equipped Radiation Therapy Department.  The petitioner however had not undergone the requisite internship of minimum 12 months.  It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that for completion of a Diploma, prior to 2012, there was no requirement of a one year internship. It was also argued that the said requirement was introduced only after 2012. The petitioner's counsel thus argued that the one year internship was not required. Rejecting the contention, the bench said: "We are unable to accept this contention for the reason that the advertisement, in addition to prescribing an educational qualification of a Post Graduate degree and a Post M.Sc. Diploma also requires an internship of a minimum 12 months in a recognized well equipped Radiation Therapy Department, which admittedly the petitioner does not possess." The plea was dismissed, observing that Agarwal did not satisfy the requisite essential qualification and as such was not qualified for the post. "As noticed hereinabove, since the petitioner does not satisfy the prescribed educational qualification, we find no infirmity in the order of the Tribunal rejecting the Original Application of the petitioner. The petition is accordingly without merit and is dismissed," the court ordered.  Title: MS PRIYANKA AGARWAL v. UNION PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND ANR.    
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has dismissed a petition filed by social activist Prof. SK Bhalla seeking transfer of a defamation complaint, filed against him by a journalist in Doda, to Jammu. The bench of Justice M A Chowdhary said that an accused cannot be allowed to have a place of his choice to be prosecuted by taking refuge of unfounded personal security apprehensions. Bhalla claimed that the respondent was irked by his social media post about "Two Fake RTI Activists of Doda" which allegedly uncovered respondent's "evil misdemeanors". This led to the criminal defamation complaint and summons were issued to him. In order to make out a case for transfer, Bhalla submitted that his security and safety are a concern as he apprehends danger to his life because of litigation voiced against the land and liquor mafias, land encroachers, politicians as well as other corrupt bureaucrats who are involved in those cases/PILs.  Contesting the plea the respondent submitted that Bhalla had appeared before the trial Court on 15.04.2022 and had executed an undertaking to appear on each and every date of hearing. It also submitted that it will be inconvenient to the respondent to prosecute his case at Jammu since all his witnesses hail from Doda. The High Court noted Section 407(1)(c)(ii) of CrPC which provides that any particular case or appeal can be transferred from a Criminal Court subordinate to its authority to any other such Criminal Court of equal or superior jurisdiction when it is expedient for the ends of justice and general convenience of the parties or witnesses. However, no occasion was made out to exercise this power as the alleged threat perception was not evaluated by any security agency. It was a mere apprehension and Bhalla had not even complained to any authority to seek security, the Court noted. The Court further pointed to the convenience of parties, stating that Bhalla would only travel from Jammu to Doda as an individual, whereas the complainant and his witnesses who are all based in Doda will have to face more difficulty, physically as well as financially, to prosecute the complaint at Jammu.  "The petitioner/accused, in the considered opinion of this court, cannot be allowed to have a place of his choice to be prosecuted in a case of defamation, taking refuge of unfounded personal security", the bench added.  Accordingly the bench found the petition without any merit and dismissed the same.

Emphasizing that judicial strictures need to be passed with utmost circumspection, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday observed that such orders are bound to have an "everlasting affect" on the reputation of the person against whom such remarks are made.  Observing that every word forming part of a judicial order forms a permanent record, Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma said that judicial restraint as warranted by law and judicial proceedings is one of the qualities of a judicial officer. "Use of denigrating remarks against anyone, especially against police officials impeaching their credibility and questioning their sense of dedication towards duty, is not the best course adopted by a judicial officer, that too when the same is not required for the adjudication of the case before the Court. Such criticism may have a devastating effect on the professional career of an officer," said the court.  Justice Sharma however said that the court in no way "undermines the majesty of the court and its power to pass orders pointing out any disobedience on part of police officers or fault in any investigation." The court made the observations while dealing with a plea filed by a SHO posted at Greater Kailash-I police station seeking deletion of remarks made against him by the trial court in criminal appeals arising out of a case registered under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  The SHO had also sought quashing of the directions issued by the trial court to the Commissioner of Police for an inquiry against him. The trial court on September 06 said "Whether or not an officer like SHO PS GK-I is fit for performing duties as SHO is left on wisdom of CP, Delhi to take a call..." While expunging the remarks, Justice Sharma observed that undesirable judicial strictures that penalise a person without enquiry stigmatise the officer and must be avoided. "Social memories that stigmatize a person in society or in one‟s department or social circles are often as permanent as the judgments and orders," the court said.  The court further said that though the police officers are duty bound to discharge their responsibilities with utmost conviction, the practical difficulties which are faced by them cannot be overlooked and disregarded by courts.  "The judicial power comes with utmost responsibility to exercise adjudicatory liberty to express oneself. Judicial strictures against a police officer to the extent as expressed in the present case are problematic though every disapproval expressed by exercise of adjudicatory liberty of expression may not fall in the realm of lack of judicial restraint," the court said.  Observing that the strictures made by the trial court against the SHO are beyond the mandate of law, judicial precedents and discipline of judicial restraint, the court said the same amounted to "over-stepping adjudicatory liberty of expression exercised by a judge." "Such observations have the effect of stigmatizing without conviction, sentencing without inquiry and affect career in future of an officer which had to be left to the internal administrative vigilance and disciplinary proceedings to be conducted by the parent department of the officer in question," the court said.  The bench said the trial court could have forwarded the proceedings, the issue faced by it and the act of disobedience to the concerned Commissioner of Police for action as per their departmental Standing Orders and the rules applicable to them. "In the relevant cases, recourse could have been taken to the Delhi Police Act and the relevant Sections under law under which the Court can issue notice and initiate appropriate action if so warranted in a particular case. However, to direct the authority concerned to initiate action as mentioned in the impugned order and thereafter, ask for compliance to be filed and pass remarks as in the impugned order was unwarranted in the facts and circumstances of the case," the court said.  Allowing the plea, the court directed that the order be circulated for the benefit of all judicial officers and Director (Academics) of Delhi Judicial Academy for taking note of the same.  Title: AJIT KUMAR v. STATE (NCT OF DELHI)    
The Karnataka High Court has made it clear that an adopted child can seek compassionate appointment following the death of his/her adoptive parent who took care of the family. A division bench of Justices Suraj Govindaraj and G Basavaraja observed,  "A son is a son or a daughter is a daughter, adopted or otherwise, if such a distinction is accepted then there would be no purpose served by adoption."  The Court was hearing a writ appeal preferred by an adopted son whose application for compassionate employment, following the demise of his adoptive father who was working as Class-IV employee in the office of Assistant Public Prosecutor, was rejected. The Appellant was adopted in 2011 after Vinayak Muttatti's natural son died in a road accident. Muttatti himself passed away in 2018. The application for compassionate appointment was dismissed on the ground that the appellant was "adopted". A writ petition challenging this order was dismissed by a single bench of the High Court on the ground that the Karnataka Civil Service (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) Rules, 1996 (as applicable on date of Appellant's application) do not provide for an adopted son to be considered for compassionate appointment.  While deciding the appeal, the division bench noted that Muttatti left behind his wife, the adopted son and his natural daughter who is mentally retarded and physically handicapped. It observed, "The appointing authority would have to consider the application of compassionate appointment if indeed there is financial stringency or difficulty requiring compassionate appointment...In the present case, the daughter being a natural daughter, would have been entitled to a compassionate appointment if not for her being mentally retarded as also physically handicapped. In such a situation, it is the adopted son who was so adopted by the deceased to take care of the family on account of the death of a natural-born son who has applied for a compassionate appointment."  It rejected Respondent's contention that the 1996 Rules do not provide for consideration of adopted son for compassionate appointment. Rather, it noted that the Rules were amended in 2021 to the effect that adopted son would have to be treated equally to that of a natural son while considering an application for compassionate appointment. The High Court ruled though the amendment was introduced subsequent to Appellant's application, its benefit could not be denied to him. It held, "The distinction made between the adopted son and a natural son by respondent Nos.2 and 4 either on the basis of the existing Rules in our considered opinion would not have any impact or role to play in the matter... taking into account that the same would violate Article 14 of the constitution, the said Rules have been amended so as to do away the artificial distinction."  It therefore directed the authorities to consider Appellant application within 12 weeks, as if he is a natural born son of the deceased.  Case Title: GIRISH S/O VINAYAK KMUTTATTI v.

The Tripura High Court recently observed that employees of statutory organizations cannot claim, as a matter of right, the pensionary benefits, as provided to few of the corporations who have been able to generate their own funds with one-time support from the state government. The observation was given by Justice Arindam Lodh while dealing with a batch of writ petitions filed against several State government undertakings, including Tripura Road Transport Corporation, Tripura Tea Development Corporation, Tripura Rehabilitation and Plantation Corporation, Tripura Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation, Tripura Schedule Tribe Co-operative Development Corporation, Tripura Small Industries Corporation, Tripura Jute Mills, Tripura Industrial Development Corporation, Tripura State Co-operative Marketing Federation and Tripura Khadi and Village Industries Board.  The employees working in these organizations sought similar Pension benefit as granted to autonomous bodies like Tripura Board of Secondary Education. The High Court noted that these autonomous bodies had created separate scheme and had been able to generate own funds from their own contribution and opened subscriber accounts with specified schemes of the organization like LICI, banks etc. On the other hand, the Respondent Corporations, though were supposed to be profit making, were utilizing the funds provided by the State government even to the extent of 100%, and were yet running in loss. "In this situation, in my opinion, the employees of these statutory organizations cannot claim, as a matter of right, the pensionary benefits, as provided to few of the corporations who have been able to generate their own funds with one-time support from the state government. Furthermore, the employees of the present batch of writ petitions cannot be treated equally to the employees of those organizations whose pension schemes have been introduced under different schemes with the assistance of some other organizations like LICI, bank, etc., while the pension of the members of the petitioner's organization is determined on the basis of the pension scheme subscribed by each of them during his/her service tenure in the respective organization and are primarily controlled and regulated by EPFO. As such, the petitioners cannot complain of discrimination having regard to the equity clause enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, " the Court held.  Court further remarked that pension is not a one-time benefit but is a continuous liability and whether or not it is to be granted or to whom it is to be granted depends on the government, the court cannot interfere into it. "The writ court while exercising the power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India will not as a court of appeal sit over the well-reasoned report of the expert body following the well-neigh principle of self-restraint in the matter of policy decisions of the government. As a logical corollary, both the questions set out here-in-above for decision have been answered in negative." In view of the above, the court dismissed the petition.

The Karnataka High Court has ruled that in the absence of an application filed under Section 33 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) for correction of typographical errors in the arbitral award, the Court cannot pass an order modifying and correcting the arbitral award on the basis of a Memo filed before it by a party.  The Single Bench of Justice E.S. Indiresh held that after the lapse of 30 days from the passing of the arbitral award, no application for rectification of typographical mistakes under Section 33 of the A&C Act can be entertained.  The petitioner Abhiram Infra Projects Private Limited entered into an agreement with the Karnataka Slum Development Board for some construction work. After some disputes arose between the parties under the agreement, the petitioner invoked the Arbitration Clause. The Sole Arbitrator passed an award in favour of the petitioner and rejected the counter claims made by the respondent Commissioner of Karnataka Slum Development Board.  The petitioner filed an Execution Petition before the trial Court for execution of the arbitral award. The respondent/judgment debtor filed a Memo before the trial Court. The trial Court allowed the said Memo and modified the arbitral award. Against this order of the trail Court, the petitioner filed a writ petition before the Karnataka High Court.  The petitioner/ award holder Abhiram Infra Projects submitted before the Karnataka High Court that an Executing Court has no jurisdiction to correct the award passed by an Arbitrator.  The petitioner averred that neither the respondent nor the petitioner filed an application under Section 33 of the A&C Act for correction of typographical mistakes, and therefore the Executing Court/ trial Court could not modify the arbitral award.  Section 33(1) of the A&C Act provides that a party may, within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award, and with a notice to the other party, request the Arbitral Tribunal to correct any computational, clerical or typographical errors or any other errors of a similar nature occurring in the award. Also, if so agreed to by the parties, a party may, with a notice to the other party, request the Arbitral Tribunal to give an interpretation on a specific point or part of the arbitral award.  Section 33(2) provides that if the arbitral tribunal considers the said request justified, it shall make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty days from the receipt of the request, and the interpretation given shall form a part of the arbitral award.  The Court noted that under Section 33 of the A&C Act, an application for correction and interpretation of the arbitral award has to be made within 30 days from the date of receipt of the arbitral award by the parties. The Court added that any correction in the arbitral award can be made only after providing an opportunity to both the parties.  The Court observed that no such application under Section 33 of the A&C Act had been filed before the Executing Court, and that the respondent had filed a Memo before the Executing Court seeking clarification of the award.  The Court noted that the thirty days' time period for filing an application under Section 33 before the Arbitral Tribunal had elapsed. Therefore, the Court observed that the Executing Court had allowed the Memo filed by the respondent/judgment debtor and had passed the order modifying the arbitral award by exercising jurisdiction under Section 36(1) and 36(2) of the A&C Act.  The Court held that the said order passed by the Executing Court was impermissible in law since no application had been filed by the respondent/judgment debtor, before the Arbitral Tribunal or before the Execution Court, seeking correction of the typographical mistakes.  The Court observed that the Delhi High Court in the case of S.P.S. Rana versus MTNL and Ors. (2010), had ruled that unless an application or petition under Section 33(1) of the A&C Act is filed within 30 days of the passing of the arbitral award, the mandate of the Arbitral Tribunal is terminated after the passing of the award. The Delhi High Court had held that once the mandate of the Arbitral Tribunal terminates, it is not possible to file an application or petition under Section 33 of the A&C Act.  Thus, the Court held that after the lapse of 30 days from the passing of the arbitral award, no application for rectification of typographical mistakes under Section 33 of the A&C Act can be entertained.  Therefore, the Court ruled that in the absence of an application filed by the respondent under Section 33, the trial Court should not have passed an order modifying and correcting the arbitral award.  Thus, the Court allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the trial Court.

The role of the Arbitrator is to arbitrate within the terms of the contract, the Supreme Court observed in a judgment passed on Tuesday (1 Feb 2022) The bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and Abhay S. Oka observed that an award can be said to be patently illegal where the Arbitral Tribunal has failed to act in terms of the contract or has ignored the specific terms of a contract. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.  took a plot of land on lease for a term of 29 years, from M/s Shree Ganesh Petroleum Rajgurunagar. They executed two agreements viz. Lease Agreement and Dealership Agreement. While the lease agreement provided for reference of disputes to the Managing Director of the the IOC for arbitration and if the Managing Director was unable or unwilling to act as a sole Arbitrator, then the sole arbitration of any other person designated or nominated by the Managing Director, the dealership agreement provided for reference of disputes to the sole arbitration of the Director (Marketing) of the Corporation who might either himself act as the Arbitrator or nominate some other officer of the Corporation to act as the Arbitrator.  By a letter dated 20th August 2008, the Corporation terminated the dealership and called upon it to vacate the retail outlet and hand over peaceful possession thereof to the Corporation and also to settle accounts with it. This resulted in appointment of an arbitrator who passed an award, by which he increased the monthly lease rent of the land in question from Rs.1750/- to Rs.10000/- with 10% increase after every three years w.e.f. the date of the termination of the dealership and to the extent the Arbitrator has reduced the period of lease from 29 years to 19 years and 11 months. The issue in this case whether the adjudication of the dispute under the lease agreement was beyond the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator? The High Court, in the impugned judgment disposing arbitration appeal, noted that the corporation had not objected to the competence or the authority or jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to entertain and decide disputes with regard to lease agreement.  In appeal, the Apex Court bench observed that the impugned award insofar as it pertains to lease rent and lease period is patently beyond the scope of the competence of the Arbitrator appointed in terms of the dealership agreement by the Director (Marketing) of the Corporation. Referring to various judgments, the bench noted the following in this regard: An Arbitral Tribunal being a creature of contract, is bound to act in terms of the contract under which it is constituted. An award can be said to be patently illegal where the Arbitral Tribunal has failed to act in terms of the contract or has ignored the specific terms of a contract.. However, a distinction has to be drawn between failure to act in terms of a contract and an erroneous interpretation of the terms of a contract. An Arbitral Tribunal is entitled to interpret the terms and  conditions of a contract, while adjudicating a dispute. An error in interpretation of a contract in a case where there is valid and lawful submission of arbitral disputes to an Arbitral Tribunal is an error within jurisdiction. The Court does not sit in appeal over the award made by an Arbitral Tribunal. The Court does not ordinarily interfere with interpretation made by the Arbitral Tribunal of a contractual provision, unless such interpretation is patently unreasonable or perverse. Where a contractual provision is ambiguous or is capable of being interpreted in more ways than one, the Court cannot interfere with the arbitral award, only because the Court is of the opinion that another possible interpretation would have been a better one.An award ignoring the terms of a contract would not be in public interest. In the instant case, the award in respect of the lease rent and the lease term is in patent disregard of the terms and conditions of the lease agreement and thus against public policy. The role of the Arbitrator was to arbitrate within the terms of the contract. He had no power apart from what the parties had given him under the contract. If he has travelled beyond the contract, he would be acting without jurisdiction. An Arbitral Tribunal is not a court of law. It cannot exercise its power ex debito justitiae.               
The Supreme Court held that a government employee who is a Kashmiri Migrant cannot retain Government accommodation for a period exceeding three years.The Court held that the Office Memorandum allowing the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants to retain Government accommodation for indefinite long period is unconstitutional for being as being totally arbitrary... The Supreme Court held that a government employee who is a Kashmiri Migrant cannot retain Government accommodation for a period exceeding three years. The Court held that the Office Memorandum allowing the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants to retain Government accommodation for indefinite long period is unconstitutional for being as being totally arbitrary and discriminatory. There cannot be any justification on the basis of social or economic criteria to allow the Kashmiri Migrants to stay in Government accommodation for indefinite long period, the bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and AS Bopanna observed. The bench observed that   Recently, the court had set aside a Punjab and Haryana High Court order allowing a retired Intelligence Bureau Officer to retain Government accommodation.  In this case, the court was considering some miscellaneous applications seeking recall of certain orders passed by the Court. The court noticed an office memorandum allowing government accommodation to the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants. In this regard, the court made the following observations: Classification Discriminatory The compassion shown to Kashmiri Migrants has to be balanced with the expectations of the serving officers to discharge their duties effectively. The Government accommodation is meant for serving officers and cannot be taken as a recourse to stay in Government accommodation for the life time of the Government servants or his/her spouse..We find that the Office Memorandum allowing government accommodation to the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants cannot meet the touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The Government houses/flats are meant for serving Government employees. Post retirement, the government employees including Kashmiri Migrants are granted pensionary benefits including monthly pension. The classification made in favour of Government employees who were Kashmiri Migrants  stands on the same footing as that of other Government employees or public figures. There cannot be any justification on the basis of social or economic criteria to allow the Kashmiri Migrants to stay in Government accommodation for indefinite long period. Totally arbitrary and discriminatory To say that they would return to the Valley when the situation will improve is an open-ended statement capable of being interpreted in different ways. The satisfaction of improvement of situation would be widely different by the erstwhile Government employees and the State. But in no case it can be countenanced that the former Government employee, may be a Kashmiri Migrant, is entitled to stay in a government accommodation for an indefinite period. Thus, we are unable to uphold the Office Memorandum and strike it down as being totally arbitrary and discriminatory. The court noted that in Para 2(ii) of the Scheme, Kashmiri Pandits were to be accommodated in Delhi for first five years starting from the date of their retirement and thereafter be shifted to National Capital Region. "Thus, we find it reasonable if Kashmiri Migrants are allowed government accommodation for a period of three years from the date of retirement so as to make alternative arrangements within such period. If an alternative accommodation is not available for them at their instance, they are at liberty to move to the transit accommodation or to avail cash amount in lieu of transit accommodation. Thus, a government employee who is a Kashmiri Migrant would not be entitled to retain Government accommodation for a period exceeding three years, may be in Delhi or in the National Capital Region or for that matter anywhere in the country.  Cooling off period   The three-years period can also be considered as cooling off period for the officers who were in active intelligence work so that they can resume normal life but the excuse of once working for intelligence agency is not a valid ground to to occupy the Government accommodation for indefinite period.

Someone's Hate Consumed Mahatma Gandhi's Body But Not His Love For Humanity: Allahabad HCWhile granting bail to an accused in connection with a criminal case over an altercation between political rivals that suddenly escalated into a violent brawl, the Allahabad High Court last week observed that someone's hate did consume Mahatama Gandhi's body, but not his love for humanity."Seekers of different paths would do well to remember the Father of the Nation. The Mahatma by the example... While granting bail to an accused in connection with a criminal case over an altercation between political rivals that suddenly escalated into a violent brawl, the Allahabad High Court last week observed that someone's hate did consume Mahatama Gandhi's body, but not his love for humanity. "Seekers of different paths would do well to remember the Father of the Nation. The Mahatma by the example of his life and the fact of his death, reminds us that the quest of 4 all religions and the essence of an Indian's Dharma is love for fellow beings. Someone's hate consumed his body, but not his love for humanity. A bullet stilled his mortal frame but could not silence the truth in him," the Court observed. Significantly, the Bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot also endorsed the Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb as it noted that it is not a ritual to be observed in conversations, in fact, it is a soul force to be harnessed in conduct. "Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb is not a ritual to be observed in conversations, infact it is a soul force to be harnessed in conduct. Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb culture is not mere tolerance of differences, but heartful embracement of diversity. The ethos of the State of Uttar Pradesh brings out the catholicity of Indian philosophy." Stressing that sectarian violence fractures the peace, and fissures the society, the Court observed that all sections of the society have to own up to their responsibilities to promote fraternity among all citizens and ensure peace. "Many generations of Indians gave their blood, sweat, tears and toil to wrest freedom from the shackles of slavery. The founding generations had steered the country through stormy seas; it is the duty of all Indians to helm the nation into calm ports," the Court remarked. These observations came as the Court granted bail to one Anwar who has been booked under Sections 147, 148, 504, 307, 354Kha, and 324 IPC in connection with an incident wherein people from two sides had engaged in violence in the aftermath of the election results. The counsel for the bail applicant argued that a general and vague role was assigned to him and that he had not been identified as the principal offender who inflicted life-threatening injuries on the injured persons.  However, before the Court, the counsels of both the parties (applicant and informant) agreed to take measures to keep the peace and restore the traditional harmony and faith between all sections of the society.  Significantly, the Counsels, on their own, submitted that both the parties would serve cool Sherbet (शर्बत) and water to passersby and thirsty travelers for one week at a public place in District Hapur in May-June 2022.  Court's observations  Against this backdrop, at the outset, the Court found it fit to grant bail to the accused (on the condition of participating in the cool water and Sherbet distribution event) as it underscored that selfless service and refined dialogue will strengthen the resolve of the society to shun hate and violence. Lastly, observing that the incidents of mob violence spread disaffection in the society and are incompatible with the rule of law, and have no place in any civilized nation, the Court also remembered a song of lyricist Pradeep, wherein he had beckoned Indians to fortify the hard-won republic: "हम लाए हैं तूफ़ान से कश्ती निकाल केइस देश को रखना मेरे बच्चों सम्भाल केतुम ही भविष्य हो मेरे भारत विशाल केइस देश को रखना मेरे बच्चों सम्भाल के" Case title - Nawab v.

The Karnataka High Court has held that a Muslim man is duty-bound to make provision for his ex-wife's maintenance beyond iddat period, despite paying Mehr, if she remains un-remarried and is incapable of maintaining herself. Justice Krishna S Dixit said, "Marriage amongst Muslims begins with the contract and graduates to the status as it ordinarily does in any other community;... The Karnataka High Court has held that a Muslim man is duty-bound to make provision for his ex-wife's maintenance beyond iddat period, despite paying Mehr, if she remains un-remarried and is incapable of maintaining herself.  Justice Krishna S Dixit said,  "Marriage amongst Muslims begins with the contract and graduates to the status as it ordinarily does in any other community; this very status gives rise to certain justiciable obligations...such a marriage dissolved by divorce, per se does not annihilate all the duties & obligations of parties by lock, stock & barrel; in law, new obligations too may arise, one of them being the circumstantial duty of a person to provide sustenance to his ex-wife who is destituted by divorce." The Court made it clear that the right of an un-remarried ex-wife to received maintenance is co-extensive with her requirement, the yardstick being the life essentials and not the luxury.  It added,  "The approach of courts should be consistent with the progression of law achieved precedent by precedent through judicial activism, despite some clergical resistance thereto; this branch of Muslim personal law has marched from April to May in Shah Bano (1985) 2 SCC 556 and now finds June of its life in Shayara Bano (2017) 9 SCC 1; any adjudication of maintenance disputes without reference to this progression of law runs the risk of being tainted as an unfair treatment of the subject matter."  Case Background  The couple married in March 1991, the mehr amount was fixed at Rs 5,000. The marriage was short-lived after the wife complained of dowry harassment etc and left the matrimonial house. The husband on November 25, 1991, uttered talaq and paid the wife the mehr amount and Rs 900 for her maintenance during the iddat period.  In 2002, the un-remarried wife filed a civil suit seeking maintenance from the ex-husband. The ex-husband resisted the same on the grounds that he contracted another marriage after talaq; he has begotten a child too; the ex-wife had filed a dowry harassment case wherein he has been acquitted. Moreover, the ex-wife should invoke the provisions of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986; in no circumstance, he would pay anything.  Eight years after the filing of the suit, the issues were framed and after nine years on August 12, 2011, the Family court ordered that the ex-wife was entitled to monthly maintenance of Rs 3,000 from the institution of the suit till her death or till she gets remarried or till the death of the ex-husband.  The ex-wife filed an execution application for having the decree executed. The husband resisted the same and the trial court on December 14, 2012, sent him to civil prison. However, he was released within a month on payment of an amount of Rs.30,000. Following which the husband filed an application under Civil Procedure Code for determining his financial incapacity, which came to be rejected. Thereafter he moved the High Court.  Court's Findings  On going through the records, the court firstly lamented that "This is yet another case of a hapless Muslim divorced wife battling for two decades for executing a maintenance decree."   The court then proceeded to analyse marriage under the Mohammedan Law, which is a civil contract. It said, "Ex-husband's contention that amongst Muslims, marriage is only a civil contract, cannot be disputed."  However, the Court noted that, "Marriage is a contract" has many shades of meaning; it is not sacrament unlike a Hindu marriage, is true; whatever be the epistemology, marriage crowns the parties with status like husband, wife, in-laws, etc; if children are born, they earn the promotional status of father & mother, and of grand-parents too, if the lineage continues; when marriage is dissolved, only the spousal tie is torn and the status comes to an end; however, the blood of divorced spouses flows in the veins of their children and grandsire; added, demise of a spouse renders the other a widow/widower; succession to estate may also open."  It added, "All the above shows the kinds of relationship that the marriage as a social institution brings in, regardless of religion which the parties belong to and the contractual elements; to put it succinctly, marriage amongst Muslims begins with the contract and graduates to the status as it ordinarily does in any other community; this very status gives rise to certain justiciable obligations; they are ex contractu; a Muslim marriage is not a sacrament, does not repel certain rights & obligations arising from its dissolution; such a marriage dissolved by divorce, per se does not annihilate all the duties & obligations of parties by lock, stock & barrel; in law, new obligations too may arise, one of them being the circumstantial duty of a person to provide sustenance to his ex-wife who is destituted by divorce."  Justice Dixit then quoted from the Holy Quran and said "There is also sufficient intrinsic material in the Holy Quran & Hadith, which lays foundation to the accrual of a corresponding right in favour a divorced wife for maintenance; generally it is conditioned by three cumulative factors viz (i) mehr amount is insignificant; (ii) she is incapable of paddling her life boat on her own; & (iii) she has remained un-remarried."  The court then discussed the right of indigent Muslim wife for maintenance and whether it is confined to iddat or limited to mehr amount. It said, "Ordinarily, the right of an ex-wife to maintenance does not extend beyond iddat. I should hasten to add that Islamic jurisprudence has not treated this as a 'Thumb Rule' ever, although there is some juristic opinion in variance. This norm has to be subject to the rider that the amount paid to the ex-wife, be it in the form of mehr or be it a sum quantified on the basis of mehr, or otherwise, is not an inadequate or illusory sum."  Further, it observed,  "It is a matter of common knowledge that more often than not, mehr is fixed inadequately, bride-side lacking equal bargaining power inter alia because of economic & gender-related factors; this is not to say that the inadequacy of mehr would affect the validity of nikah." It added, "The payment of frugal mehr money per se cannot be a defence availing to an able bodied man for denying the claim or defying the decree, for maintenance."  The court also said, "The reason & justice tell us that an illusory mehr cannot be the basis for the quantification of the amount of maintenance nor for limiting its duration to iddat. The analogy of "illusory compensation" is logically invocable since the payment of the amount by the husband as mehr on talaq, by its very nature has compensatory elements."  The court also noted that divorce brings a trainload of difficulties to the women; divorced women in general and divorced Muslim women, in particular, undergo a lot of hardship; the tears they shed are hidden in their veils.  Following which it said, "The contentions that the duty to furnish essentials to the ex-wife is coterminous with iddat period post talaq and that the quantum of maintenance amount cannot exceed the size of Mehr money, are difficult to sustain in 'Law in a Changing Society'; in the contemporary costly society wherein blood is cheaper than bread."  Commenting on the amount paid by the ex-husband to his wife the court said "The tokenistic amount of Rs.5,000 paid as mehr or its quantification on the basis of mehr, is militantly unjust and illusory. The paltry sum of Rs.900 to the respondent ex-wife as maintenance during iddat i.e., for a period of about three months, only celebrates the inadequacy & illusoriness; this amount will not be sufficient to buy a cup of popcorn a day from the street carter too."  The court then relied on the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of Navtej Singh Johar's, (2018) 10 SCC 1 (decriminalizing homosexuality), wherein it recognized the Doctrine of non-retrogression of rights. The court said, "In our realm, several human rights have been progressively realized over the years through the process of socio-economic development accelerated by legislative and judicial process; in the light of Article 38 of the Constitution. The judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative functions of the State aimed at furthering social welfare has to be consistent with the concerns which this new doctrine voices."   It added, "A survey of law relating to rights of women in general and of divorced women in particular in all civilized jurisdictions, is marked by a progressive trend protective of the vulnerable; in the backdrop of all this, if the above question (i) is answered in the negative, it would only take the "maintenance jurisprudence" in retrogression imperiling the interest of divorced Muslim women; a negative answer to the question virtually amounts to setting the clock back at least by a few centuries turning a Nelson's Eye to all the progress that the civilized world has made."  The court rejected the grounds raised by the ex-husband resisting the payment of maintenance and said "Courts have repelled the argument of financial incapacity while awarding maintenance when the husband has an able body. Therefore, the pecuniary incapacity of the judgment debtor that ordinarily avails as a ground for resisting the execution of a money decree, does not come to the rescue of the petitioner."  Further, it junked the contention of the petitioner that he has contracted another marriage and begotten a child. The court said, "A Muslim hurriedly contracting another marriage after pronouncing talaq upon his first wife, cannot be heard to say that he has to maintain the new spouse and the child begotten from her as a ground for not discharging the maintenance decree; he ought to have known his responsibility towards the ex-wife who does not have anything to fall back upon; the said responsibility arose from his own act of talaq and prior to espousing another woman; the responsibility & duty owed by a person to his ex-wife are not destroyed by his contracting another marriage, an argument to the contrary would amount to placing premium on the irresponsibility of a husband who divorces the existing wife and soon espouses another."  It added, "Countenancing the contention of the kind virtually amounts to permitting a person to take the advantage of his own wrong; this contention is repugnant to law, morality & ethics; if such a contention is countenanced, that would only encourage talaq which the law Shuns."  Accordingly, the court dismissed the petition and directed the ex-husband to pay a cost of Rs 25,000 and also directed the trial court to accomplish the execution on a war footing and report compliance to the Registrar General of the High Court within three months.

The Supreme Court has observed that the provision in Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which requires the consent of State Government for CBI to exercise of powers and jurisdiction, are in tune with the federal character of the Constitution. "Though Section 5 enables the Central Government to extend the powers and jurisdiction of Members of the DSPE beyond the Union Territories to a State, the same is not permissible unless, a State grants its consent for such an extension within the area of State concerned under Section 6 of the DSPE Act. Obviously, the provisions are in tune with the federal character of the Constitution, which has been held to be one of the basic structures of the Constitution.", the bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and BR Gavai observed in a judgment delivered on Tuesday (11 Nov 2020). The CBI, in this case, had registered crime against Fertico Marketing and Investment Private Limited and others alleging that the coal purchased under the FSA was sold in the black market. Later, it was found that the officials of District Industries Centre were also involved. The High Court dismissed their petition observing that the State Government had granted Post-Facto consent against the two public servants of the State Government whose names had figured during the course of investigation. It was held that the Post-Facto consent was sufficient for investigation by the CBI for the offences against the two public servants, whose names though did not find place in the FIR but were found in charge-sheet. The contention raised in this case by the accused-appellant was that, in the absence of the consent of the State Government under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, the DSPE (CBI) had no powers to conduct investigation in view of the provisions contained in Section 6 of the DSPE Act. It was further contended that the failure in obtaining the consent prior to registration of the FIR would go to the root of the matter and vitiate the entire investigation. On the other hand, the state contended that the prior consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act is not mandatory but directory.  While considering these contentions, the Court noted that the State of Uttar Pradesh has accorded a general consent for extension of powers and jurisdiction of the Members of DSPE, in the whole of State of Uttar Pradesh for investigation of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and attempts, abetments and conspiracies in relation to all or any of the offence or offences committed in the course of the transaction and arising out of the same facts. The same is however with a rider, that no such investigation shall be taken up in cases relating to the public servants, under the control of the State Government, except with prior permission of the State Government, the bench noted. The court also noted that a Post-Facto consent was given by the State Government vide notification under Section 6 of the DSPE Act to the authorities to investigate the public servants-accused. "The cognizance and the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about miscarriage of justice. It has been held, that the illegality may have a bearing on the question of prejudice or miscarriage of justice but the invalidity of the investigation has no relation to the competence of the court.....Even for the sake of argument that CBI had committed an error or irregularity in submitting the charge-sheet without the approval of CVC, the cognizance taken by the learned Special Judge on the basis of such a charge-sheet, would not be set aside nor could further proceedings in pursuance thereof be quashed." While upholding the High Court view, the bench observed that there are no pleadings by the public servants with regard to the prejudice caused to them on account of non-obtaining of prior consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act qua them specifically in addition to the general consent in force, nor with regard to miscarriage of justice. However, taking note of the fact that the High Court has not answered some of the issues framed by it, the bench remitted the case back to it for considering the said issues.  CASE: FERTICO MARKETING AND INVESTMENT PVT. LTD. vs. CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION [CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 760- 764 OF 2020] CORAM: Justices AM Khanwilkar and BR GavaiCOUNSEL: Sr. Adv Mukul Rohatgi,Sr. Adv Ajit Kumar Sinha, ASG S.V. Raju   Read Judgment     
The Delhi High Court has ordered that there will be age relaxation of three years in the upper age limit as a “one time measure” for candidates intending to apply for the posts of Head Constable (Ministerial) in CRPF 2022 examination. An advertisement for the posts was issued on December 27 last year.  A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Neena Bansal Krishna has directed the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Central Government to issue a Corrigendum on or before January 25, the last date of applying to the post in question and also to extend the date of inviting applications.  The court took note of Rule 9 of Central Reserve Police Force Act, 1949 which gives power to the Central Government to relax the rules if it is of the opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do.  “… when Rule 9 of CRPF grants the power to relax the Rules wherever necessary, in the interest of justice, we find that relaxation of three years in the upper age limit can be given to the candidates who wish to apply pursuant to the advertisement in question,” the bench said. The court was hearing two pleas filed by various candidates seeking relaxation of the upper age limit for appearing in the CRPF 2022 examination for Head Constable (Ministerial) post.  The age limit of candidates prescribed was from 18 to 25 years as on the closing date of receipt of application i.e. January 25, meaning that a candidate should not born before January 26, 1998 or after January 25, 2005. It was the case of the petitioners that the CRPF had issued a detailed advertisement in 2016 for filling-up 686 vacancies for direct recruitment to the post of Head Constable (Ministerial) but the petitioner candidates could not be selected. Thereafter, after a period of six years on December 27 last year, an advertisement for filling-up vacancies was issued.  It was argued that the age limit of the candidates prescribed for the posts is from 18 to 25 years but since no recruitment was conducted for last 5 to 6 years, the petitioners have become over-aged and crossed the maximum prescribed age limit of 25 years, thus becoming ineligible to apply for the examination. The counsel representing the petitioners argued that the main reason for them being age barred is the fact that the CRPF did not conduct any examination for recruitment to the post of Head Constable (Ministerial) for the year 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The counsel appearing for Central Government submitted that due to unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Home Affairs vide letter dated July 26, 2022 granted three years age relaxation beyond prescribed upper age limit for all categories of candidates as a “One-Time Measure” to all categories candidates for the recruitment of Constable (GD) in CAPFs, SSF and Rifleman(GD), Assam Rifles Examination 2022 and 2023.  It was submitted that if the age relaxation is granted as per the said order, the age limit for the post of Head Constable (M) will be raised from 25 years to 28 years for General candidates, from 25 years to 31 years for OBC candidates and from 25 years to 33 years for SC or ST candidates. The court was also told that since there was no superannuation between 2019 and 2021, therefore, no vacancies against the retirement for the said period fell out. The last recruitment for the post of Head Constable (Ministerial) was conducted in the year 2016 and completed in September, 2017, the central government counsel said. The court in the judgement said that CRPF, for the reasons best known to it, has been avoiding recruitment process since 2017 for the appointment to the post of Head Constable (Ministerial). The court also said that while it is conscious of the fact that during the period 2019 to 2020, the appointments in government departments and organisations were put to hold, it cannot ignore the fact that all such departments have been fully functional since 2021 “Even despite directions of this Court vide order dated 08.03.2022 in WP(C) No.3874/2022, the respondents did not commence recruitment process. It is only when the petitioners therein approached this Court in contempt proceedings, the respondents have now published vacancies for the post of Head Constable (Ministerial) in the year 2022 after a lapse of six years,” the court said.  The court observed that the petitioner candidates and other similarly situated personnel cannot be deprived of the right to appear in the examination, in view of the fact that such candidates have been deprived to seek recruitment in CRPF for no fault of theirs, due to non-conduct of examination and in view of the fact that after 2016 till 2022, no examination for the post in question was held.  “At this juncture, we do not hesitate to observe that the lethargy and delay in publishing the vacancies for the recruitment to the said post, after a lapse of six years, has curtailed the future prospects of candidates like the petitioners who are willing and striving for appointment in Forces,” the court said.

Emphasizing that India worships little girls, but at the same time, the cases of pedophilia are increasing in the Country, the Allahabad High Court today denied bail to a man who has been booked for raping a 13-year-old girl. Importantly, the Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh observed thus: "In such a situation, if the right decision is not taken from the Court at the right time, then the trust of a victim/common man will not be left in the judicial system. This is the time to strictly stop this kind of crime." The case before the Court The Court was hearing the plea of a man who allegedly raped a 13-year-old girl when she was alone in the house for doing some household work and all her family members had gone to the agricultural field for cutting fodder. Allegedly, the applicant taking the advantage of the situation, forcibly entered the house of the informant, and threatening to kill the victim, dragged her inside the room by grabbing her hair, and forcibly committed rape upon the victim. During the course of this unfortunate incident, suddenly the informant, her son Rohit and one Magan came to the house and knocked on the door, but when they entered the house, they saw the victim lying unconscious in a naked condition and the applicant tried to flee by climbing the wall. However, he was caught and when the victim gained consciousness, she narrated the whole incident. Thereafter, the police was informed about the incident on phone by the family members of the informant, on which the applicant was arrested by the police from the house of the informant. The counsel for the Applicant argued that there was a love affair between the victim and the applicant and that she had herself called the applicant, but he was caught hold by the family members of the victim.  Court's observations At the outset, the Court noted that the victim, aged about 13 years, is studying in the fifth standard, and in the opinion of the doctor, who conducted her medical examination, signs of violence seen and sexual violence cannot be ruled out.  Thus, noting that the in this case, a small innocent girl had been raped, who does not understand its meaning, the Court remarked thus: "Rape is a heinous crime. The victim suffers from psychological effects of embarrassment, disgust, depression, guilt, and even suicidal tendencies. Many cases go unreported. In almost rape cases, the victim was unwilling to report the name of the abuser. The 4 families of the victim remain silent about the sexual offences in order to protect the family image. The victim/female small child experience sexual abuse once tend to be more vulnerable to abuse in adult life. Healing is slow and systematic." Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions advanced on behalf of parties, the gravity of the offence, and the severity of the punishment, the Court did not find any good ground to grant bail to the applicant. Accordingly, the bail application was rejected Case title - Jasman Singh @ Pappu Yadav v. State of U.P. and Another  Read Order  
The Karnataka High Court has reiterated that the landlord-tenant disputes governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 are arbitrable in nature.  The Single Bench of Justice E.S. Indiresh observed that the Supreme Court in the case of Vidya Drolia versus Durga Trading Corporation (2020) had overruled its decision in Himangi Enterprises versus Amaljit Singh Ahulvalia (2017). The Court thus held that the landlord-tenant disputes between the parties under the lease deed, which was governed by the Transfer of Property Act, could be referred to arbitration.  The respondent / lessor Aries Agro - Vet Associates (Pvt) Limited entered into a lease deed with the petitioner Gokaldas Images Private Limited. The respondent filed a suit before the trial Court seeking ejectment of the petitioner from the leased property, along with arrears of rent and damages, and an injunction restraining the petitioner from subletting the leased property. Thereafter, the suit was transferred to the Commercial Court. The petitioner filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) seeking reference of the dispute between the parties to arbitration as per the Arbitration Clause contained in the lease deed. The respondent filed an objection to the said application. The trial Court passed an order rejection the application filed by the petitioner. Against this, the petitioner filed a writ petition before the Karnataka High Court.  The petitioner Gokaldas Images submitted before the High Court that the trial Court dismissed the application filed by the petitioner by relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Himangi Enterprises versus Amaljit Singh Ahulvalia (2017), wherein the Supreme Court had held that the issue relating to the lease is not arbitral in nature. The petitioner averred that the Supreme Court in the case of Vidya Drolia versus Durga Trading Corporation (2019) had ruled that the judgment rendered in the case of Himangi Enterprises (2017) was required to be reconsidered by a Bench of three Judges of the Supreme Court. Thus, the petitioner submitted that the order passed by the trial Court, by relying upon the judgment in Himangi Enterprises (2017), was incorrect.  The High Court noted that the trial Court, by placing reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Himangi Enterprises (2017), had ruled that since the lis between the parties was relating to eviction as well as arrears of rent, therefore, the said dispute was non-arbitrable.  The Court observed that the Supreme Court in the case of Vidya Drolia (2019) had ruled that the judgment rendered in Himangi Enterprises (2017) was required to be relooked by a larger Bench of the Supreme Court.  The Court noted that, thereafter, the Supreme Court in the case of Vidya Drolia versus Durga Trading Corporation (2020) had ruled that the landlord-tenant disputes governed by the Transfer of Property Act are arbitrable as they are not actions in rem but they pertain to subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in rem. The Court observed that the Supreme Court had overruled the ratio laid down in Himangi Enterprises (2017) and had held that the landlord-tenant disputes are arbitrable in nature since the Transfer of Property Act does not forbid arbitration. However, the Court noted that the Supreme Court had held that the landlord-tenant disputes covered by rent control legislation would not be arbitrable, if a specific court or forum was given exclusive jurisdiction under the Statute to decide special rights and obligations.  Considering that the dispute between the parties under the lease deed was governed by the Transfer of Property Act, the Court thus held that the order passed by the trial Court could not be sustained. The Court, therefore, allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the trial Court.  Case Title: Gokaldas Images Private Limited versus Aries Agro-Vet Associates (Pvt) Limited & Anr.

The Karnataka High Court has said that National Highways Act does not provide for issuing a second award with respect to the land acquired pursuant to Notifications under 3-A and 3-D of the Act. A single judge bench of Justice E S Indiresh allowed a batch of petitions and set aside the second award by the competent authority dated 22nd January, 2021 and Order dated 27th January, 2021, which granted a lower compensation to the petitioners in lieu of their land. Senior Advocate G S Kannur appearing for one of the petitioners had argued that pursuant to the acquisition proceedings initiated by the respondent authorities, the authorities had passed the award dated 17th December, 2020 determining the compensation.  Further, he contended that said award was signed by the competent authority. However, thereafter, the authority issued another award dated 22 January 2021, drastically reducing the compensation. It was argued the said second award is non-est and cannot be accepted. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the coordinate bench in the case of National Highways V. Assistant Commissioner And Competent Authority, wherein it was held that the authorities have no authority under law to pass second award. Senior Advocate Udaya Holla appearing for National Highway, contended that the relief sought for by the petitioners is not maintainable in view of the availability of alternative and efficacious remedy under National Highways Act. It was also argued that the award dated 17th December, 2020 is only a draft award. Findings: The bench noted that respondent-authorities issued preliminary notification on 09th January, 2020 under Section 3-A of the Act followed by the final Notification dated 10th July, 2020 under Section 3-D of the Act. The competent authority was authorised to effectuate the acquisition proceedings as per Notification dated 27th June, 2014, the bench noted. "The respondent-authorities issued Notification dated 17th December, 2020, determining the compensation under Section 3-G of the Act, read with Section 29 of the Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013," it added. The court said it has carefully examined the notification on the first award and found that the same does not mention that it was a draft award. It added the letter dated 22nd January, 2021, issued by the Special Land Acquisition Officer to the Project Director, National Highways Authority of India, whereby the former has revised the award under Section 3-G of the Act in respect of the land situated in Puttige village of Mudabidri taluk, clearly substantiates the petitioner's arguments that "the award dated 22nd January, 2021, is a second award made by the respondent-authorities in the absence of specific provision under the National Highways Act, providing for making second award with respect to the land acquired pursuant to Notifications under 3-A and 3-D of the Act." The court said writ petitions deserve to be allowed. As regards the contention of the respondents that petitioners have alternate remedy to challenge the award the bench said, "The said submission cannot be accepted for the reason the impugned award dated 22nd January, 2021 said to have been issued by the respondent-authorities under section 3- G of the Act upon issuing the earlier award dated 17th December, 2020 (Annexure-D), which creates rights in favour of the petitioners claiming compensation under the Act." It added, "In that view of the matter, reviewing the very same award by way of impugned award dated 22nd January, 2021 does not arise at all and the same is without jurisdiction and therefore, this Court is having jurisdiction to exercise powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to set right the jurisdictional error on the part of the respondent-authority while issuing second award." The bench also said that if the instrumentality of the State, has acted in contravention of the statutory provisions which affect the rights of the parties concerned, such illegal and arbitrary action, on the part of authorities, has to be nipped in the bud and cannot be perpetuated since the very action of such authorities is not only an irregularity in nature but also amounts to illegality which cannot be accepted under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. "In that view of the matter, even if the alternative remedy is available for the petitioners to approach the competent authority under the provisions of the Act, however, the same cannot be said to be an efficacious remedy to nullify such erroneous decision on the part of the respondent authorities," it said.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has ruled that the test to ascertain and uphold the fundamental right against "double jeopardy", which is guaranteed under Article 20(2) of the Constitution, is that whether the former offence and the offence now charged have the same ingredients in the sense that the facts constituting the one are sufficient to justify a conviction of the other... The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has ruled that the test to ascertain and uphold the fundamental right against "double jeopardy", which is guaranteed under Article 20(2) of the Constitution, is that whether the former offence and the offence now charged have the same ingredients in the sense that the facts constituting the one are sufficient to justify a conviction of the other and not that the facts relied on by the prosecution are the same in the two trials. A single bench of Justice Sanjay Dhar was dealing with two petitions filed under section 482 CrPC seeking quashing of two complaints on the ground that the petitioner cannot be prosecuted twice on the basis of some set of facts as it would amount to double jeopardy.  The record before the court revealed that the respondent-complainant had filed two separated complaints alleging offences under sec 138 NI Act before trial court Srinagar. The record also revealed that prior to the filing of the aforesaid two complaints, the respondent-complainant had also filed an application before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Budgam, pursuant to order passed by the said Court an FIR for offences under Section 420, 506 IPC of P/S, Budgam, came to be registered. It was also brought to the notice of the bench that the contents of the aforesaid FIR are identical to the impugned complaints and challan against the petitioner had been produced before the competent court wherein offences under Section 420 and 506 of IPC stand disclosed against the petitioner.  In order to deal with the moot question as to whether a person can be prosecuted for offence under Section 420 of IPC as also for offence under Section 138 of NI Act on the same set of facts and whether or not it would amount to double jeopardy, the bench found it worthwhile to reproduce the observations of supreme court in Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay, AIR 1953 SC 325, wherein the constitutional bench of SC observed:  "The fundamental right which is guaranteed under Article 20 (2) enunciates the principle of "autrefois convict" or "double jeopardy" i.e. a person must not be put in peril twice for the same offence . The test is whether the former offence and the offence now charged have the same ingredients in the sense that the facts constituting the one are sufficient to justify a conviction of the other and not that the facts relied on by the prosecution are the same in the two trials. A plea of "autrefois acquit" is not proved unless it is shown that the verdict of acquittal of the previous charge necessarily involves an acquittal of the latter."  Applying the said ratio the court observed that it is clear that offences under Section 138 of the NI Act and Section 420 of IPC are distinct from each other because ingredients of the two offences are different. While in a prosecution under Section 138 of NI Act, fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of issuance of cheque need not be proved but in a prosecution under Section 420 of IPC, such intention is an important ingredient to be established, the bench underscored .  The bench delving deep into the subject further recorded that for proving offence under Section 138 of NI Act, it has to be established that the cheque has been issued by the accused to discharge a legally enforceable debt or liability and the same has been dishonoured for insufficiency of funds etc. and despite receipt of statutory notice of demand, the accused has failed to pay the amount of cheque within the stipulated time. It is only when accused fails to make the payment within the stipulated time upon receipt of notice of demand that the offence under Section 138 of NI Act is made out against an accused. Therefore, the two offences are distinct from each other and the principle of double jeopardy or rule of estoppel does not come into play, the bench observed.  Dismissing the petition the court stated that the mere fact of respondent-complainant had lodged an FIR, which has culminated in lodging of a challan against the petitioner containing allegations relating to the same transaction which is subject matter of the impugned complaints, does not make out a case of forum shopping or double jeopardy. The complainants are well within their rights to continue prosecution for both these offences i.e. offences under Section 138 of NI Act and Section 420 of IPC simultaneously, the bench concluded.

The Supreme Court has observed that criminal proceedings for the dishonour of cheque under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, are "quasi-criminal" in nature.The Court also made an interesting comment that Section 138 proceedings can be called a "civil sheep" in a "criminal wolf's clothing".A bench comprising Justices RF Nariman, Navin Sinha and KM Joseph made these... The Supreme Court has observed that criminal proceedings for the dishonour of cheque under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, are "quasi-criminal" in nature. The Court also made an interesting comment that Section 138 proceedings can be called a "civil sheep" in a "criminal wolf's clothing". A bench comprising Justices RF Nariman, Navin Sinha and KM Joseph made these observations while deciding the issue whether the moratorium declared under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code will bar Section 138 NI Act proceedings against the corporate debtor. One of the issues before the Court was whether Section 138 NI Act case will come within the ambit of the word "proceeding" used in Section 14 IBC. Many High Court had taken the view that since the proceedings under Section 138 NI Act were criminal in nature, they will not be hit by Section 14 IBC. While examining the correctness of that view, the bench sought to ascertain the true nature of Section 138 NI Act. The bench noted that while enacting Section 138, the legislature was cognizant that "what is otherwise a civil liability is now also deemed to bean offence". A debt barred by limitation is outside the scope of Section 138.This, coupled with fine that may extend to twice the amount of the cheque that is payable as compensation to the aggrieved party to cover both the amount of the cheque and the interest and costs thereupon, would show that it is really a  hybrid provision to enforce payment under a bounced cheque if it is otherwise enforceable in civil law.  Since the provision mandates giving an opportunity to the drawer of the cheque to pay back the amount, by serving him a statutory demand notice, the Court observed that "the real object of the provision is not to penalise the wrongdoer for an offence that is already made out, but to compensate the victim". The bench further noted that mens rea was not an ingredient of the offence. It also took note of the fact that there is a departure from the procedure under the Code of Criminal Procedure for cheque cases. First and foremost,no court is to take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 138 except on a complaint made in writing by the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque – the victim. Also, there is the concept of "cause of action" in Section 142(1)(b), which says that the complaint must be filed within one month of the "cause of action" arising. The judgment observed that the concept of cause of action is "conspicuous by absence" in Chapter XIII of the CrPC, consisting of Sections 177 to 189, which deals with the jurisdiction of criminal courts. The bench next said that the 2018 amendment to NI Act, which introduced provisions for interim-compensation, gave a further tilt towards civil nature of the proceedings. Referring to the judgment in CIT v. Ishwarlal Bhagwandas, (1966) 1 SCR 190, the judgment observed that "a civil proceeding is not necessarily a proceeding which begins with the filing of a suit and culminates in execution of a decree". "Given these tests, it is clear that a Section 138 proceeding can be said to be a "civil sheep" in a"criminal wolf's" clothing, as it is the interest of the victim that is sought to be protected, the larger interest of the State being subsumed in the victim alone moving a court in cheque bouncing cases, as has been seen by us in the analysis made hereinabove of Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act", the bench observed. Moratorium Under Section 14 IBC Covers Section 138 NI Act Proceedings Against Corporate Debtor For Cheque Dishonour : Supreme Court Quasi-criminal proceedings The Additional Solicitor General, Aman Lekhi, objected to describing Section 138 proceedings as "quasi criminal". He argued that since the provisions metes out the type of punishments prescribed under Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code, it cannot be termed "quasi-criminal". The Court rejected this argument saying that there are many instances of acts which are punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which have been described as quasi-criminal - such as the criminal contempt, breach of Companies Act provisions etc. "Clearly, therefore, given the hybrid nature of a civil contempt proceeding, described as "quasi-criminal" by several judgments of this Court, there is nothing wrong with the same appellation "quasi-criminal"being applied to a Section 138 proceeding for the reasons given by us on an analysis of Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act. We,therefore, reject the learned Additional Solicitor General's strenuous argument that the appellation "quasi-criminal" is a misnomer when it comes to Section 138 proceedings and that therefore some of the cases cited in this judgment should be given a fresh look", the bench observed. The Court held that Section 138 proceedings against the corporate debtor will come under the ambit of Section 14 IBC. "Given our analysis of Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act together with the amendments made thereto and the case law cited hereinabove, it is clear that a quasi-criminal proceeding that is contained in Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act would, given the object and context of Section14 of the IBC, amount to a "proceeding" within the meaning of Section14(1)(a), the moratorium therefore attaching to such proceeding", the judgment authored by Justice Nariman observed.

The Karnataka High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Kannada actor Chetan A. Kumar for quashing of an FIR lodged against him under Section 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code, on charges of allegedly making statements which promote enmity, hatred or ill-will between different sections of the Society. Justice M I Arun said whether the statements made by Kumar amount to an offence as contemplated under Section 505(2) of IPC or not, is a subject matter of investigation.  "It is needless to state that the first respondent - Police will not mechanically file a charge sheet without due investigation. The petitioner under the circumstances is always at liberty to move the appropriate Court for obtaining the necessary bail and the same shall be considered by the concerned Court in accordance with law," the court said. The court added as the matter is still under investigation, it is not possible for it to decide as to whether the allegations made against the petitioner constitute an offence as contemplated under Section 505(2) of IPC. "It is needless to state that if the first respondent - Police decides to file a charge sheet against the petitioner after completion of investigation, the petitioner is always at liberty to move this Court in accordance with law," it added. A Bengaluru resident Shivakumar had filed a complaint in October before Sheshadripuram police station against the actor alleging that he gave statements which "hurt the sentiments of the Hindu religion" which can disturb the peace in the society.  Challenging the registration of FIR against him, Kumar in the plea said he has not uttered any statement which would create or promote enmity, hatred or ill-will between the persons of the Society.  "He has merely expressed his opinion regarding the Tribal deity worship not being a part of Hindu religion and that it is a fair comment and is academic in nature and cannot be considered as promoting any enmity, hatred or ill-will between the persons in the Society and does not constitute an offence as contemplated under Section 505(2) of IPC," his counsel told the court/  The prosecution opposed the plea saying that whether he has made a statement which would promote enmity, hatred or ill-will between the persons of the Society, is a matter of investigation and only upon seizing of the relevant material, the police will be able to determine whether the petitioner has committed such an offence. It also called the petition premature.  Case Title: Chethan A. Kumar v. State of Karnataka  Case No: Criminal Petition no. 10651 of 2022  Date of Order: 23rd day of November, 2022   Appearance: S.

Ramasubramanian observed that appointment of members by the method of nomination always stands on a slightly different footing than election.In this case, the appointment of one Shaikh Mahemud as a Member of the Maharashtra State Board ... The Supreme Court observed that the term of office of a nominated member of Wakf Board can be curtailed. The bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian observed that appointment of members by the method of nomination always stands on a slightly different footing than election. In this case, the appointment of one Shaikh Mahemud as a Member of the Maharashtra State Board of Waqfs, by a notification dated 13.09.2019, was cancelled by a subsequent notification dated 04.03.2022. The said cancellation was set aside by the High Court of Bombay as arbitrary. According to the High Court (i)  the term of office of a Member of the Board stipulated under Section 15 of the Waqf Act cannot be curtailed except in the case of disqualification under Section 16 or removal under Section 20; and (ii) the cancellation of appointment was arbitrary. While considering the appeal filed by the State, the court noted that the appointment of the Members of the Board can be by two different methods namely, (i) election from each of the electoral colleges as stipulated in clause (b) of sub­section (1) of Section 14; and (ii) nominations by the State Government in terms of clauses (c), (d) and (e) of sub­section (1) of Section 14. The court also noted that the appointment in this case was by the method of nomination by the State Government in terms of clause (c) of sub­section (1) of Section 14.  Referring to other provisions of the Act, the bench observed: Though Section 14(9) is common to the appointment under both categories and though Section 15 speaks about the term of office of members appointed by a notification under Section 14(9), nomination always stands on a slightly different footing than election. Perhaps, as per the scheme of the Act, it may not be possible for the State Government to breach the process of election from each of the electoral colleges under clause (b) of sub­section (1) of Section 14, by curtailing the term of office of such elected members. But the same logic cannot be extended to nominated members. In other words, it may not be possible to hold that there is no elbow space for the State Government in the cases of nomination covered by clauses (c), (d) or (e). ... It must be noted that under clause (e) of sub­section (1) of Section 14, an officer of the State Government not below the rank of Joint Secretary to Government may be nominated to the Board. If Section 15 is construed in the manner in which the High Court has construed, such a nominated officer of the State Government may have to be allowed to continue, even if he reaches superannuation before completing five years of tenure. Therefore, it is not possible to accept the view of the High Court that the term of office prescribed under Section 15 cannot be curtailed. This is so at least in respect of a nominated member. The court also rejected the contention that since Section 14 deals only with appointment and not with removal, the notification of cancellation was not in accordance with law. The court observed that the power to  appoint would include the power of cancellation of appointment. The bench therefore allowed the appeal and upheld the cancellation notification.

The Karnataka High Court has said that the right of a woman to exercise her reproductive choice is a dimension of "personal liberty" as understood under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and she has a sacrosanct right to have her bodily integrity protected.  A single judge bench of Justice N S Sanjay Gowda said that,  "The act of forcing a woman to bear with an unwanted intrusion on her body and endure the consequences of that intrusion would be a clear transgression of her inviolable fundamental right of "personal liberty" guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution."  The Court was dealing with a case where the medical practitioner had refused to terminate the pregnancy of a 16 years old rape survivor, as it had crossed 24 weeks as set down in Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971.  The petitioner had approached the court urging that she cannot be forced to carry the burden of crime and cannot be compelled to deliver a baby which has been conceived against her will.  The court while allowing the petition noted,  "In cases of rape inflicted on minor girls, though there are certain statutory limitations prescribed under the 1971 Act, they would essentially be applicable only to medical practitioners. In such cases, the requirement to terminate the pregnancy medically would have to be considered and examined in an altogether different light by the Constitutional Courts."  Referring to sections 3 (2) (a) and 3 (2) (b) of the MTP Act, which stipulates the procedure for termination of pregnancy in cases not exceeding 20 weeks and not beyond 24 weeks, the court said,  "It is thus clear that the law creates a statutory presumption of grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman if she alleges that the pregnancy was caused due to an alleged rape."  Noting that the Act does not provide for termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks by medical practitioners even if it is alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape, the court said,  "It should also be kept in mind that a minor who has been raped and has become pregnant due to it, will be forced not only to be a victim of the crime but would also be compelled to bear with the burden of the crime inflicted on her by forcing her to deliver a child, the conception of which, was not due to the exercise of her reproductive choice. In fact, the fate of the child, if delivered, may also be perilous and detrimental to its own interest given the social stigma that would hover around it."  The court went on to opine that, "the statutory limitations imposed in a statute cannot be an impediment or a restriction on the exercise of Constitutional power of the High Courts. The exercise of this constitutional power would obviously be exercised rarely, sparingly and in exceptional circumstances and would obviously rest on the facts of each case."  Referring to Section 3 (2B) of the Act which excludes the applicability of the time of the length of pregnancies by the medical practitioner, if the termination is necessitated by the diagnosis of any substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by a Board, the court observed, "That the 1971 Act does not create an absolute bar for termination of pregnancies that have traversed even beyond the period of 24 weeks stipulated in Section 3(2) (b) of the Act."  Further, it referred to section 5 of the Act and said, "The Act, in fact, allows termination of pregnancy by a medical practitioner, without reference to the length of the pregnancy or without reference to the pre-conditions requisite for conducting them, if the continuance of the pregnancy constitutes a risk to the very survival of the pregnant woman."  Following which the court held,  "The consequences of continuing the pregnancy on the future life of the 16 year old would be quite severe and detrimental to a dignified life as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution."  The court also went through the opinion offered by the Medical Board comprised of Gynecologist, Radiologist and Psychiatrist and other doctors and said, "In my view, having regard to the circumstances explained above and the specific opinion rendered by the Medical Board, the petitioner has made out a case for issuance of a direction to terminate the pregnancy."  Accordingly the court directed that, "The 2nd respondent (District Health Surgeon, Belgavi), to ensure the medical termination of pregnancy of the petitioner forthwith in accordance with the provisions of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 and having regard to the opinion of the board."

The Supreme Court observed that though an insurance surveyor's report is not so sacrosanct, a Consumer Forum which is primarily concerned with an allegation of deficiency in service cannot subject it to 'forensic examination of its anatomy'."Once it is found that there was no inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of performance of the duties and... The Supreme Court observed that though an insurance surveyor's report is not so sacrosanct, a Consumer Forum which is primarily concerned with an allegation of deficiency in service cannot subject it to 'forensic examination of its anatomy'. "Once it is found that there was no inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of performance of the duties and responsibilities of the surveyor, in a manner prescribed by the Regulations as to their code of conduct and once it is found that the report is not based on adhocism or vitiated by arbitrariness, then the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum to go further would stop", the bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian observed said. The court observed thus while upholding a Judgment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission confining the compensation payable to claimants only to the extent of the assessment as made by the final Surveyor. In this case, a "Standard Fire and Social Perils" policy was taken by the complainant from the insurance company. When the policy was in force, a fire broke out in its factory premises. One M/S Adarsh Associates, appointed by the Insurance Company, conducted a survey, and submitted its report assessing the loss suffered as Rs.2,86,17,942. Aggrieved, the complainant filed a consumer complaint before the National Commission claiming inter alia compensation in a sum of Rs.1364.88 lakhs. The commission directed the insurance company to pay only the amount of Rs.2,85,76,561 as admitted by them. Taking note of the documents on record, the Apex Court bench observed that the objections to the Surveyors' Report are wholly unsustainable and that the National Commission rightly rejected those objections.  "31. This is not a case where the Insurance Company has repudiated the claim of the appellant arbitrarily or on unjustifiable grounds. This is a case where the claim of the appellant has been admitted, to the extent of the loss as assessed by the Surveyor. In cases of this nature the jurisdiction of the special forum constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is limited. Perhaps if the appellant had gone to the civil court, they could have even summoned the Surveyor and cross examined him on every minute detail. But in a complaint before the Consumer Forum, a consumer cannot succeed unless he establishes deficiency in service on the part of the service provider.", the court observed. Surveyor is governed by a code of conduct 32. It is true that even any inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of performance which is required to be maintained by or under any law or which has been undertaken to be performed pursuant to a contract, will fall within the definition of the expression 'deficiency'. But to come within the said parameter, the appellant should be able to establish (i) either that the Surveyor did not comply with the code of conduct in respect of his duties, responsibilities and other professional requirements as specified by the regulations made under the Act, in terms of Section 64UM(1A) of the Insurance Act, 1938, as it stood then; or (ii) that the insurer acted arbitrarily in rejecting the whole or a part of the Surveyor's Report in exercise of the discretion available under the Proviso to section 64UM(2) of the Insurance Act, 1938. 37.... They are (i) that the surveyor is governed by a code of conduct, the breach of which may give raise to an allegation of deficiency in service; and (ii) that the discretion vested in the insurer to reject the report of the surveyor in whole or in part, cannot be exercised arbitrarily or whimsically and that if so done, there could be an allegation of deficiency in service. 38. A Consumer Forum which is primarily concerned with an allegation of deficiency in service cannot subject the surveyor's report to forensic examination of its anatomy, just as a civil court could do. Once it is found that there was no inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of performance of the duties and responsibilities of the surveyor, in a manner prescribed by the Regulations as to their code of conduct and once it is found that the report is not based on adhocism or vitiated by arbitrariness, then the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum to go further would stop.

The Karnataka High Court has expressed deep anguish over the actions of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) and its officials who for almost 15 years failed to pay compensation to landowners whose properties were acquired for public purpose in 2007.  Justice Krishna S Dixit, while partly allowing the petition filed by one M V Guruprasad, said, “The government cannot act as a robber of citizen’s lands.”   “Taking away private lands for the purported public purpose sans compensation militates against the spirit of constitutional guarantee enacted u/a 300A, the fundamental right to property no longer being on the statute book, notwithstanding,” it added  The court also said that State and its instrumentalities are constitutionally expected to conduct themselves with fairness & reasonableness in all their actions.   The petitioners had approached the court against the acquisition of land done vide Preliminary Notification dated 09.01.2007, followed by the Final Notification dated  17.05.2007 issued under provisions of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966.  The authority opposed the plea saying that acquisition having been completed by issuance of Final Notification on 17.05.2007, the lands have vested in the State and therefore, the same cannot be restored to petitioners.   "After the land owners notified the change of khatha pursuant to subject sale deeds, the Government had issued a Corrigendum Notification on 05.06.2014 mentioning their names and because of the protocol process, there is some delay and now the payment of compensation will be made," the State said.  The bench noted that on the date of Preliminary Notification, names of the Petitioners had not figured as khatedars in the Revenue Records and therefore, the KIADB was justified in notifying the acquisition in the names of their vendors, who were the Khatedars.  It further said that petitioners by representation dated 09.01.2013 had requested the KIADB for payment of the compensation for having taken their lands and had also sent the reminder dated 01.07.2014 & 03.07.2014.  "In fact, the Government issued a Corrigendum Notification dated 05.06.2014 mentioning their names and thereby entitling them to payment of compensation. However, compensation has not been paid even to this day. There is no plausible explanation as to why the payment of compensation is withheld for decade and a half. It hardly needs to be stated that payment of compensation is essential when private property is acquired for public purpose," it added.  Noting that the petitioner’s property has vested in the State vide Final Notification dated 17.05.2007, the bench said, “KIADB ought to have woken up and arranged for payment of the payment of compensation. However, strangely it has filed its Statement of Objections seeking dismissal of the petition contending that they have already developed the land and allotted the same to several entrepreneurs.”  Further noting that in the entire Statement of Objections, neither the State nor the KIADB has said anything about the compensation being payable to the Petitioners, the bench said such a conduct reinforces the "shackles of a feudalistic attitude, from which the transformative character of our constitution seeks to liberate.”  “Their action in not paying the compensation is not only grossly violative of property rights constitutionally guaranteed under Article 300A but gnaws at overarching objectives of a Welfare State ordained under the Constitution," said the court.  Observing that this court cannot deny justice that is eminently due to the aggrieved citizens by quoting some constitutional theories, the bench said: “The petitioners be paid at least 50% of the compensation to be computed under provisions of the 2013 Act, (Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act), along with solatium, interest & such other things.”  It clarified that in special circumstances of the case and because of the stay of a Coordinate Bench decision in a case wherein the court has directed payment of compensation under the 2013 Act, "The provisions of the 2013 Act are taken only for the purpose of determining/re-fixing the compensation amount on a normative basis till after & subject to decision in the Writ Appeal."  It added: “Writ Courts being the custodians of Constitutional Rights of the citizens, have to individualise justice taking into account the facts & circumstances of the case at hand.”  Case Title: M V Guruprasad & ANR And State of Karnataka  Case No: WRIT PETITION NO. 61426 OF 2016  Date of order: 10-02-2023  Appearance: Advocate Veeranna G Tigadi for petitioners.

The Supreme Court recently reiterated that when a remedy under the statute is available, filing of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is to be discouraged by the High Court. The bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi & Vikram Nath rendered this observation while considering SLP preferred by secured creditor assailing Telangana HC's orders passed in a SARFAESI matter. Factual Background  Proceedings were initiated under SARFAESI, 2002 against the respondent/borrower after he had committed default and his account was declared as NPA. An application u/s 14 was also filed & the authorized officer along with the Commissioner on 29th January, 2019, took over the physical possession of the secured asset. This was challenged by the respondent/borrower in writ and thereafter further action was initiated by the petitioner in publishing the auction-cum-sale notice dated 27th February, 2019. Later another writ was filed assailing the auction notice. After filing of the writ petitions, the respondent/borrower approached the Debt Recovery Tribunal with an appeal along with an application for stay on auction. On March 28, 2019 a conditional order was passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal wherein directions were issued to the bank to proceed with the auction sale, but not to confirm the same. Taking note of the conditional order of DRT dated 28th March 2019, the High Court on 8th April, 2019 passed an order with a further direction to the petitioner to return the possession of the subject property to the respondent/borrower and by a subsequent order dated 13th April, 2019 made certain modifications in regard to payment of instalments. Proceedings Before Supreme Court  While issuing notice on 3rd July, 2019, the Top Court granted the bank interim relief and directed the parties to maintain status quo. Later, the Top Court was informed that the securitization application filed by the Respondent borrower came to be dismissed in default on 16th July, 2019 and no steps were taken for its restoration by the respondent. On being apprised of the same, the Top Court said,  "Since the substantive issue was to be examined by the DRT in the pending SA No.109 of 2019 and since the respondent/borrower has remained a defaulter and after the account became NPA, possession of the secured assets was taken over by the petitioner bank, in this backdrop, nothing further survives to be examined in this petition and the special leave petition has become infructuous." Referring to the ratio laid down in United Bank of India vs. Satyawati Tandon & Ors. (2010) 8 SCC 110, the bench said, "Before parting with the order, we would like to observe that this Court is consistent of the view and can be noticed from the judgment in United Bank of India vs. Satyawati Tandon & Ors. (2010) 8 SCC 110, that when a remedy under the statute is available and in the instant case which indeed was availed by the respondent/borrower, filing of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is to be discouraged by the High Court." 
While hearing a criminal appeal preferred by a priest accused of sexually assaulting a young girl, the Kerala High Court on Thursday voiced its concern over the pitiful fate of women abandoned by their husbands, particularly of the helpless children."When a man abandons his wife and children, roving vultures wait to prey on not only the abandoned woman, but also the helpless children. In... While hearing a criminal appeal preferred by a priest accused of sexually assaulting a young girl, the Kerala High Court on Thursday voiced its concern over the pitiful fate of women abandoned by their husbands, particularly of the helpless children. "When a man abandons his wife and children, roving vultures wait to prey on not only the abandoned woman, but also the helpless children. In this case we have a 'poojari'/'komaram' (priest/oracle in a temple) taking the abandoned woman and the three children under his wing, only to repeatedly molest the elder girl child, that too in the presence of her siblings. We wonder which God would accept the obeisance and offerings of such a priest or make him a medium?"  The observations came in a matter where a temple pujari had taken an abandoned woman and her three children under his wing, only to repeatedly molest the elder girl child, that too in the presence of her siblings. Background: The incident came to light after the children were found wandering around the streets, shepherded by an almost insane mother. Child-line personnel immediately reported them to the nearest Vanitha Cell, and they were picked up at once.  On enquiry, it was revealed that the woman showed signs of acute mental illness and displayed violent tendencies. Therefore, she was taken to a Mental Health Centre along with the youngest child. This is when the child revealed that the appellant-accused had sexually molested her for one year. She was taken to the Police right away and a crime was registered against the appellant.  In her statement, the victim spoke of the repeated acts committed on her in graphic detail- the instances of the accused knocking on the door, entering inside, stifling her with a cloth pushed into her mouth, tearing off her clothes and raping her while her two younger siblings cowered in fear at the corner of the room. She also pointed out that although she complained of the same to her mother, she was asked to suffer, since the accused always came home drunk. The school-going child also revealed that the accused had threatened to kill her if she divulged what she is subjected to.  Her younger brother who was a witness to the crime spoke in tandem with the evidence provided by the prosecutrix. Contentions Raised: Advocate KM Firoz for the appellant took the Court through the charge to point out that there is a misjoinder of charges. He argued that the POCSO Act was brought into effect from 14.11.2012 and that the incident on which the first charge is levelled was prior to the POCSO Act and therefore requires a committal proceeding under the Cr.P.C. The appellant submitted that he was subjected to great prejudice due to the same.  Further, the age of the victim was not proved by the prosecution under the POCSO Act. Key Findings: The Court found that the ground of absence of committal proceedings as against the offence alleged cannot be sustained. It observed, "when the offences, which arise from the very same act, are tried together and the age of the victim is not proved, it is not as if the offence under the IPC charged against the accused would fall to the ground since no committal proceedings have been carried out under the Cr.P.C." The Court added, "When taking cognizance of a charge under the POCSO Act, the designated Special Court is empowered to try any offence, charged at the same trial. Otherwise, every trial under the POCSO Act will have to wait till the committal proceeding is over and that would defeat the very purpose of the enactment which envisages speedy disposal of the cases. It cannot also be the position that once the age is not proved, the offence under Section 376 would fail for reason of no committal proceedings having been taken under the Cr.P.C. The POCSO Act enables such other offences to be tried without committal proceedings if it is to be tried in the same trial. The grounds of prejudice urged fails also for the reason that it is merely imaginary. We reject it at the outset on the above reasoning and also on the appellant having merely 'cried foul' without the particular prejudice caused or the specific failure of justice, having been stated or substantiated." The bench also asserted that the charge was explicit and was of continued sexual assault of the penetrative kind on the victim by the accused, who was in the status of her guardian. "Mere irregularity in charge does not prejudice the accused so long as he was aware of what was expected to be defended." Additionally, the Court noted that the medical evidence clearly evidenced that the victim had been subjected to sexual acts.  Moreover, it was found that the accused had made a total denial of even the joint residence with the mother and children under Section 313. However, the deposition of the house owners specifically established that fact. "This deliberate falsehood stated by the accused under Section 313, points to his complicity and reveals the guilty mind. The accused said that he does not know the mother of the prosecutrix while there was overwhelming evidence as to the accused residing with the mother and children and his own child, as a family. " The Court found this to be an additional circumstance against the accused.  In its order, the Bench has also empathised with the mother of the victim.  "The mental state of the mother, a shame on society, is quite understandable from the stress of having been abandoned, with three children and no means of food or shelter; for which alone the children were subjected to physical, mental and sexual torture. No mother can remain sane in the said circumstances." Finally, the Court partly allowed the appeal by setting aside the appellant's conviction under the POCSO Act and Section 376(2) IPC, as the victim's age was not proved.  However, since the offence of rape was proved, the accused was convicted under Section 376(1). Considering the special relationship the accused had with the victim and the status of a guardian, the Court imposed on the appellant the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Case Title: Madhu v. State of Kerala & Ors.  
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has reiterated that Courts must adopt a practical approach while dealing with matrimonial litigation, instead of approaching the case in a hyper-technical manner. This is because matrimonial disputes ultimately affect families and human relationships. The remarks were made while setting aside a Family Court order which struck off wife's defence in a divorce case, without providing adequate opportunity. Justice Harkesh Manuja said,  "In the matrimonial litigation, the dispute is primarily relating to the human relationship, which ultimately not only affects the two families but the society at large as well and thus, the standard of strict applicability of the procedure needs to be avoided and instead of adopting hyper-technical approach, the courts are required to be more practical while dealing with such kind of litigation."  The petitioner-wife had appeared before the Family Court on 26.04.2022 and had sought time for filing of written statement to the divorce petition as well as to file reply to application for grant of interim custody of the minor child. On the next date, she sought further time for the purpose of filing written statement and reply to application, but the same could not be done and on the next date fixed thereafter, the Family Court ordered for striking off her defence.  From a perusal of zimni orders, the High Court observed that the petitioner-wife was never afforded sufficient and adequate opportunity to file her written statement. "Non-granting of adequate and sufficient opportunity to petitioner-wife for the purpose of filing of her written statement would cause substantial prejudice to her rights, involving her matrimonial dispute, including the custody of the minor child," it said.  Accordingly, the Court directed the Family Court to grant one "effective opportunity" to the petitioner to file her written statement as well as reply to the application for grant of interim custody of the minor child.  Case Title: Simrit Gulani v. Anil Gulani   Coram: Justice Harkesh Manuja        
The Madhya Pradesh High Court held that as far as an intermediate order is concerned, the court can exercise its revisional jurisdiction since it is not an interlocutory order. Justice Anjlu Palo referred to the case of Girish Kumar Suneja v. Central Bureau of Investigation, where it was observed that there are three categories of orders that a Court can pass – final, intermediate and interlocutory. "There is no doubt that in respect of a final order, a court can exercise its revisional jurisdiction, i.e., a final order of acquittal or conviction. There is equally no doubt that in respect of an interlocutory order, the Court cannot exercise its revisional jurisdiction," it added Referring to a catena of judicial precedents, the Court noted that according to Section 397(2) CrPC, revision against an interlocutory order is not maintainable. It is well settled that in deciding whether an order challenged is interlocutory or not, as far as Section 397(2) CrPC is concerned, the sole test is not whether such order was passed during the interim stage. It remarked, "If the order under challenge culminates the criminal proceedings as a whole or finally decides the rights and liabilities of the parties then the order passed is not interlocutory in spite of the fact that it was passed during any interlocutory stage. The feasible test is whether by upholding the objections raised by a party, it would result in culminating the proceedings, if so any order passed on such objections would not be merely interlocutory in nature as envisaged in Section 397(2) CrPC." The applicant-complainant filed a criminal revision, being aggrieved by the order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Jabalpur dismissing their application under Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code.  The original complainants (respondents herein) filed a complaint under Section 200 of CrPC alleging collusion amongst one another with common intention and the creation of a forged will purporting it to be the last genuine will of a deceased person. The allegation pertains to the commitment of forgery of valuable security and will, by making & possessing a counterfeit seal intending to use it as genuine and by fraudulent cancellation & destruction of the Will and codicil of the deceased person, thereby they committed offence under Sections 467, 468, 471, 472, 473, 474 and 477 read with Section 34 of IPC. The Judicial Magistrate First Class dismissed the said complaint about the want of sufficient evidence. However, the Additional Sessions Judge set aside the order observing that a prima facie case is made out for taking cognizance of the complaint. Therefore, the JM First Class took cognizance of the offences punishable under Sections 120B, 420, 465, 466, 467, 468, 471, 472, 473, 474 read with Section 34 of IPC.  The order taking cognizance was challenged by the accused, and the Court partly allowed the revision above, observing that- "the complainant and his witnesses who have been examined before trial Court at the time of taking cognizance can only be examined in Sessions Court and no other witnesses can be permitted to be examined even remaining complainant." The applicant challenged the order above before the Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition, which was partly allowed and disposed of by the Supreme Court with the direction that the complainants-petitioners shall be free to examine further witnesses, if any, including the co-complainant in the complaint before the Magistrate for which purpose the Magistrate shall fix an appropriate date.  After that, the applicant recorded her statement before Judicial Magistrate First Class and learned Judicial Magistrate First Class re-registered the complaint under Section 120B, 420, 465, 466, 467, 468, 474, 477 of IPC and committed the complaint to trial Court. Subsequently, the State filed four applications under Sections 91 and 311 of Cr.P.C. seeking production of certain documents as prayed for therein. The trial Court dismissed the said applications. Being aggrieved, the State filed a petition before this Court. This Court remanded the said applications back to the trial Court for passing an order on merits relating to the documents cited in the applications.  One of the respondents challenged the order before the Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition because he was not heard before passing the order. The Supreme Court set aside the order and remanded back the matter to this Court with direction to rehear the case.-  On remand, this Court dismissed the said petition. The applicant and the original complainants challenged the order before the Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition. The Supreme Court allowed the production of several documents as prayed for in the applications filed by the State.  During arguments on framing of charge on the complaint above, the State filed an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. seeking recall of a respondent for further examination to place on record certified copies of papers and proceedings concerning the judicial proceedings about the alleged forged Will as well as estate/assets of the deceased, which has been dismissed by the trial court on the ground that the complaint was being tried in accordance with the provisions of Sections 225-237 of Cr.P.C. which do not provide for recalling of any witness or complainant before framing of charge(s) or recording evidence before framing of charges, hence this revision. It referred to the case of Sethurama v. Rajamanickam and noted that the order summoning or refusing to summon witnesses u/s 311 CrPC is an interlocutory order within Sec. 397(2) CrPC as it does not decide any substantive right of litigating parties. Hence no revision lies against such orders.  It also referred to the case of Girish Kumar Suneja v. Central Bureau of Investigation, where the Supreme Court had held that a revisional court is under no obligation to entertain a revision petition against an interlocutory order. Such a revision petition can be rejected at the threshold. If the revisional court is inclined to accept a revision petition, it can do so only against a final order or an intermediate order; namely, an order that if set aside, would result in the culmination of proceedings. In the instant case, the applicant is calling in question an order of dismissal of an application filed by the State under Section 311 CrPC seeking recall of a respondent for further examination to place on record certified copies of papers and proceedings concerning allegation of a forged will. The Court noted that it is apparent that the order under challenge in this revision does not culminate the criminal proceedings as a whole or finally decide the rights and liabilities of the parties; therefore, it cannot be said to be a final order or an intermediate order.  Dismissing the revision as not maintainable, the Court noted that,  "The impugned order is purely interlocutory in nature. . In view of the aforesaid discussion and in the light of the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that the impugned order passed while dismissing application filed by respondent No.1/State under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for recalling the witness is an interlocutory order and in the considered opinion of this Court no revision petition against such an order is maintainable in view of the provision of Section 397 (2) of Cr.P.C."

The Delhi High Court has said that judges must exercise more control and caution while passing strictures against investigating authorities and police officers on their professional capabilities since it may impair a person’s confidence and have a negative impact on work and reputation.  Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma observed that a thin wall that exists between adjudicatory liberty to point out the flaws in an investigation or on authorities and the obligation to exhibit judicial restraint must be kept in mind.   “Though no restriction can be imposed upon judicial functioning except guidelines on judicial strictures and judicial precedents, since doing so will be against the independence of judiciary, however, a recipient of judicial stricture also cannot remain devoid of any remedies of redressal. It is the self regulation amongst the judges that maintains the institutional integrity of the judiciary,” the court said.   While emphasizing that judicial utterances on many occasions have the power to bring about social and procedural changes for the welfare of the system, the court said that judges, however, have to note the difference between judicial findings and passing of strictures.  “While there can be no doubt about the importance of judicial free speech, it being the hallmark of a free and fair judiciar, judicial self-restraint is an obligation that judiciary recognizes as created by and for themselves,” it said.   Justice Sharma also said that it is not to be forgotten by courts that though the remedy of expunging strictures is available to the recipient, but many times, the strictures live not only in public memory but also in the memory of the recipient himself.  “Social memories tend to stigmatize the recipient, though the person passing strictures will enjoy judicial immunity due to his adjudicatory freedom of expression,” the court said.   The court was hearing a plea filed by Deputy Commissioner of Police of North East Delhi challenging three orders passed by a sessions court making observations and remarks against him . The DCP also sought recall of the bailable warrants issued against him.  Justice Sharma said that the trial court was displeased due to delay in trial and passed the impugned orders “without realizing that the cause behind the delay was not the DCP but the reasons beyond his control.” Accordingly, the court expunged the remarks passed against the DCP from the impugned orders and also set aside the Bailable Warrants issued against him.  “Learned Registrar General of this Court is directed to forward a copy of this judgment to all the District and Sessions Judges of Delhi who shall ensure the circulation of this judgment among all the Judicial Officers in their Courts for sensitization of Judicial Officers on this issue. A copy be also forwarded to Director (Academics), Delhi Judicial Academy for taking note of its contents,” the court said.  Title: SANJAY KUMAR SAIN v. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI

The Allahabad High Court recently quashed a detention order passed against a murder accused by exercising powers under the National Security Act, 1980 as it observed that if a person is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released, the power of preventive detention should not be exercised. The Bench of Justice Mahesh Chandra Tripathi and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi with the habeas corpus plea of one Abhay Raj Gupta, who is presently in custody in Central Jail, Bareilly, filed through his mother, challenging his detention order dated January 23, 2021. Case brief Essentially, on account of a single incident of Murder that took place on December 2, 2019, three FIRs were lodged against the petitioner under various sections of IPC [including 302 and 307 and Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986]. Allegedly, one Rakesh Yadav was killed in pursuance of the conspiracy hatched by the petitioner, and later on, when the police apprehended him to arrest him for the aforesaid incident which occurred on December 2, 2019, he fired at the Police personnel with the intention to kill. In view of the act attributed to him, a detention order was passed against him by invoking powers under the NSA, 1980, wherein it was stated that because of the offence of gruesome murder done by the petitioner's accomplices under a conspiracy hatched by him, people got afraid and panicked and the public order was disturbed. Court's observations At the outset, persuing the detention order passed against the petitioner, the Court noted that in the detention order, there was a bald averment that in case the petitioner comes out on bail, he may again indulge in crime. However, the Court added thus: "(In the detention order) neither there is any reasonable basis to record this apprehension nor is there any averment that the apprehended activity would be prejudicial to public order and, therefore, it is necessary to detain him with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order." The Court also opined that the act allegedly committed by the petitioner did not cause a disturbance of public order as it did not disturb the society to the extent of causing a general disturbance of public tranquility. "...the single act of murder of a person because of old family animosity was not suggestive of a repetitive tendency or inclination on the part of the petitioner to act likewise in future so as to justify invocation of powers under Section 3 (2) of the NSA, 1980. The order of preventive detention passed under Section 3 (2) of the Act is unsustainable for this reason," the Court further held. Further, the Court also noted that the incident occurred on December 2, 2019, i.e., about 14 months prior to the passing of the detention order, and thus, the Court observed thus: "...a stale incident which is not proximate to the time when the detention order dated 23-01-2021 was passed and there was no live link between the alleged prejudicial activity and the purpose of detention and the invocation of the provisions of the NSA, 1980 against the petitioner after a long delay of about fourteen months was neither warranted nor justified." Importantly, the Court referred to several significant rulings of the Apex Court to conclude that there was no imminent possibility of him being released from custody and thus, the passing of the NSA detention order was unwarranted. "...the petitioner was already in Jail in a case under Sections 2/3 of the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and AntiSocial Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986, that he had not filed an application for bail in the aforesaid case and that even when he would file an application for bail, he would not be released on bail...it cannot be accepted that there was any material for recording the satisfaction of the detaining authority that with a view to preventing the petitioner from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order it was necessary to detain the petitioner under the NSA, 1980." Lastly, the Court concluded that the satisfaction which is necessary to detain the petitioner for the purpose of preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order is thus, the basis of the order under section 3 (2) of the NSA, 1980 and this basis is clearly absent in the instant case.  Therefore, the Court held that the detention order dated 23-01-2021 is unsustainable in law on this ground also. Therefore, the Writ Petition was allowed and the impugned order dated 23-01-2021 passed by the District Magistrate, Shahjahanpur ordering the detention of the petitioner Abhay Raj Gupta under Section 3 (3) of the NSA, 1980 was quashed.  The Respondents were commanded to release the petitioner from detention under the aforesaid order dated 23-01-2021 forthwith. Case title - Abhayraj Gupta v. Superintendent, Central Jail, Bareilly   
The Karnataka High Court recently allowed the claim filed under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicle Act by legal heirs of a deceased bike rider, who was killed after a big tree branch fell on his head while riding the bike. The insurance company, in appeal against the award passed by Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal, contended that the accident occurred because of fall of branch of eucalyptus tree and the same cannot be treated as a motorcycle accident and hence the company is not liable to pay the compensation.  However, a single judge bench of Justice HP Sandesh observed that the expression 'arising out of the use of the motor vehicle' used in Section 163A of the MV Act has to be given the widest interpretation. "All that need be shown by the claimant in support of the claim is that the injury or death which is made the basis for the claim arose out of the use of a motor vehicle," it held. The bench primarily relied on High Court's judgment in Sulochana & Ors. v. KSRTC, wherein it was held that all that need be shown by the claimant in support of the claim is that the injury or death which is made the basis for the claim arose out of the use of a motor vehicle.  The bench said, "The provision is not intended to introduce a rule of evidence merely shifting the burden of proof from the claimant to the owner and the driver of the vehicle. If the intention of the parliament behind the introduction of Section 163-A 21 was to simply shift the burden of proof to the owner or the driver of the vehicle, the provisions of Section 163-A would have been differently worded."  Therefore, the court said it has no hesitation in holding that victim or legal heirs of a victim are entitled to claim compensation in terms of Section 163-A read with Schedule II to the Act without either pleading or proving that the accident in question had resulted from any act of negligence or default on the part of the owner or the driver of the vehicle. Also Read: Passenger Injured On Account Of Mine Blast Entitled To Compensation Under Motor Vehicle Act: J&K&L High Court  Claimants contended that their deceased father be held as third party to the insurance policy.  The insurance company contended that it is liable to pay compensation to third party and not the owner. The claimants (respondents) contended that the deceased would become third party. To address this contention, the bench relied on Supreme Court's judgment in Ramkhiladi & Anr. v. United India Insurance Company Ltd. & Anr., wherein it was held that liability under Section 163-A of Motor Vehicles Act is on the owner of the vehicle and a person cannot be both, a claimant as also a person on whom the liability falls.  Following which the bench said, "Deceased stepped into the shoes of the owner and he was not a third party. Hence, in view of the judgement of the Apex Court in the case of Ramkhiladi, the very contention of the claimants counsel cannot be accepted."  Finally, the court held that when the additional premium had been paid towards personal accident cover to owner-cum-driver, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- has to be paid to the heirs of borrower of vehicle, since he stepped into the shoes of the owner of vehicle.  The bench said, "Hence, claimants are entitled for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- since there is explicit coverage of the insurance under the head of personal accident cover to insured-cum-driver. Hence, the Insurance Company is liable to pay compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- with interest."  Accordingly, it modified the order passed by the tribunal and said that the claimants are entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000 with interest at 7.5% p.a. from the date of claim petition till realisation as against Rs.3,62,000.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Monday observed that every case in which preventive detention of any citizen of India is sought by law enforcement agencies, the same demands a very fact-sensitive and law-centric application and approach of mind. A bench of Justice Rahul Bharti quashed a preventive detention order against a detenue, who was "painted and portrayed" as an aide of Lashar-e-Taiba (LeT) outfit by the detaining authority, merely one year after a previous detention order against the said detenu was quashed. Observing that in the period intervening the date of quashment of first detention order and the issuance of second preventive detention order there was no factual content stated in the dossier by the Superintendent of Police Handwara on the basis of which the petitioner could be said to have indulged in acts of omission or commission whereby his personal liberty was reckoned as a circumstance posing live threat to the so called security of the State, Justice Bharti stated that the dossier so served by the concerned SP before the District Judge was nothing but repetition of the premise upon which the first detention order was passed. “An application of law lives in its seriousness, and the law detests non-seriousness on the part of law operating hands and minds. The preventive detention law is no exception to this demand and command”. The bench also took note of the fact that post his release by quashment of the first detention order the petitioner was put on a bond for keeping peace under section 107/151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973; the dossier nowhere mentioned that the petitioner ever breached his bonds so as to be branded as a case for detention under the Public Safety Act, 1978. Questioning the application of mind on the part of detaining authority with regard to the instant matter Justice Bharti observed that District Magistrate seems to have relieved himself from labour and effort of independent application of mind to the dossier case put up by the SP and instead the Magistrate simply carried out re-typing of the dossier in the name of showing so called application of mind. “So much so, even the typographical error/s and omission of the dossier was/were imported and repeated as it is by the District Magistrate Kupwara”, the court frowned. Citing this matter as a best exhibit of the mechanical application of mind on the part of the District Magistrate, Justice Bharti in his order said that it seems in the instant case the issuing of the preventive detention order against the petitioner and depriving him of his personal liberty, which is a fundamental right under the Constitution of India, is a matter of pleasure for the authority seeking preventive detention and the authority granting the said preventive detention. Accordingly the bench the detention order ex-facie bad in the eyes of law and quashed the same.  Case Title: Javaid Ahmad Bhat Vs UT of J&K Coram : Justice Rahul Bharti  
In a strongly worded order concerning death of Covid-19 patients due to shortage of Oxygen supply, the Allahabad High Court stated that authorities responsible for procurement and supply of the gas are committing criminal acts.

In a strongly worded order concerning death of Covid-19 patients due to shortage of Oxygen supply, the Allahabad High Court stated that authorities responsible for procurement and supply of the gas are committing criminal acts.  "We are at pain in observing that death of Covid patients just for non supplying of oxygen to the hospitals is a criminal act and not less than a genocide by those who have been entrusted the task to ensure continuous procurement and supply chain of the liquid medical oxygen," a Division bench comprising of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar observed.  The stern remarks were made in view of viral news and social media posts regarding death of Covid patients due to lack of Oxygen in the districts of Meerut and Lucknow. The Division Bench also noted that people are being harassed, and made to beg for Oxygen cylinders to save the life of their near and dear ones, both at the end of district administration and police administration.  "How can we let our people die in this way when science is so advanced that even heart transplantation and brain surgery are taking place these days," the Bench remarked further noting that these news items show a quite contrary picture to one claimed by the Government regarding sufficient supply of oxygen.  The Court has therefore asked the District Magistrate, Lucknow and District Magistrate, Meerut to enquire into the matter of such news items within 48 hours and submit their reports on the next date fixed respectively. They are also directed to appear before the Court online on the next date fixed.  The order stated,  "Normally, we would have not directed the State and district administration to enquire into such news that have been viralled on social media but since the Advocates who were appearing in this PIL supported such news and even submitted that more or less situations in other districts of State are the same, we find it necessary to direct for immediate remedial measures to be taken by the Government."  The news items that the Bench was referring to pertain to death of five patients in ICU of a new trauma centre of Medical College in Meerut. The Court also perused reports of two hospitals, in Lucknow and in Meerut, that took their hands off the admitted Covid patients only for the reason that oxygen supply was not made even after demand.  Significantly, a suggestion was made during the hearing by a 3rd year law student, Utsav Mishra, for distribution of Remdesivir Injection and Oxygen cylinder, which are confiscated by the Police from illegal possessions, to district administration   The AAG assured that he will take up the issue with the State Government so that proper disposal of the articles like oxygen cylinder, Remdesivir Injection and oximeter is done and is not wasted.

"It has been held that when parties deliberately put their agreement into writing, it is conclusively presumed, between themselves and their privies, that they intended the writing to form a full and final statement of their intentions, and one which should be placed beyond the reach of future controversy, bad faith and treacherous memory"A Bench of Justices L... "It has been held that when parties deliberately put their agreement into writing, it is conclusively presumed, between themselves and their privies, that they intended the writing to form a full and final statement of their intentions, and one which should be placed beyond the reach of future controversy, bad faith and treacherous memory" A Bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and B.R.Gavai, made the above observations while dealing with a case involving the validity of the term of a Partnership Deed. The judgement-V Anantha Raju & Anr v T.M.Narasimhan & Ors-authored by Justice B.R.Gavai examined the contentions of the plaintiff and defendants in light of S.91 and S.92 of the Evidence Act. Factual Background The petitioners and defendants were partners in a partnership firm. As per a 1992 Deed, the plaintiff No.1 was entitled to have 50% share in profits and losses, subject to him furnishing a capital contribution of a specified amount within one year, failing which his share would only be to the extent of 10%. Vide a Deed dated 1995, some other persons were inducted as partners and the share of Plaintiff 1 and Plaintiff 2 (P1's son) were reduced to 25% each. By a 2004 Deed, Plaintiffs were removed from the partnership Deed. The defendants contend that the mentioning of 25% share in 1995 Deed was only a mistake of record and that the plaintiffs were only entitled to 10% share. The High Court, in the impugned judgement and order, upheld the Trial Court's holding that the plaintiffs together were entitled to 10% share in the profits. In appeal from the impugned judgement, the plaintiff reached the Supreme Court.  Court's reasoning The Court noted that it can be seen from the admission given by Defendant no.1 in his written statement as well as in his affidavit in lieu of examination-in-chief, that the partners have executed the 1995 Deed, is unambiguous and clear. Relying on Roop Kumar v Mohan Thedani which had elaborately explained the import of S.91 and S.92 of the Evidence Act, the Court noted that: "When persons express their agreements in writing, it is for the express purpose of getting rid of any indefinite-ness and to put their ideas in such shape that there can be no misunderstanding, which so often occurs when reliance is placed upon oral statements. " (Para 22) The court held that if a document has been produced to prove its terms under Section 91, the provisions of Section 92 come into operation for the purpose of excluding evidence of any oral agreement or statement for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding or subtracting from its terms.  It holds:  "It has been held that when parties deliberately put their agreement into writing, it is conclusively presumed, between themselves and their privies, that they intended the writing to form a full and final statement of their intentions, and one which should be placed beyond the reach of future controversy, bad faith and treacherous memory" (Para 23) The court held that in view of S.91 of the Evidence Act, the evidentiary value of the 1995 Deed would stand on a much higher pedestal, as against the oral testimony of the parties.  The Court also distinguishes the cases relied upon by the petitioners- Gangabai w/o Rambilas Gilda v Chhabubai w/o Pukharajji Gandhi and Ishwar Dass Jain (Dead) through Lrs v Sohan Lal (Dead) by Lrs- where it was held that it is permissible for the party to a deed to contend that the deed was not intended to be acted upon, but was only a sham document. The judgements notes:  " It would be necessary to lead oral evidence to show that the document executed was never intended to operate as an agreement but that some other agreement altogether, not recorded in the document, was entered into between the parties" (Para 24) The judgement observed that if it was the case of the defendants that the terms mentioned in the 1995 Deed were inadvertent or a mistake in fact, then the burden to prove the same shifted upon the defendants to prove that the Deed did not reflect the mutual intention of the parties.  With regard to the defendant's plea that the 1995 Deed was a mistake of fact, the Court notes that the Preamble to the 1995 Deed specifically states that the parties have decided to amend the term of the Partnership after negotiation of the terms. Thus, since the 1995 Deed clearly shows that it is executed after due deliberations, negotiations and mutual consensus on the terms and conditions to be incorporated therein and the contention that the share is mentioned as 25% by mistake "does not sound logical or reasoned." The judgement observes that if the 25% share mentioned in 1995 Deed was due to mistake or inadvertence, nothing precluded the defendants from rectifying the same between 1995 and 2004.  The Apex Court modified the finding of the High Court in the impugned judgement that the plaintiffs together have only 10% share in profits and losses and declared that the plaintiff together are entitled to 50% share in profits and losses.

No stipulation that such 10 years standing is as Additional District Judge.The Delhi High Court has made it clear that a District Judge or a judicial officer of not less than 10 years standing is competent to hear appeals under Section 9 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971.  The Act provides for eviction of unauthorised occupants from public premises and empowers an Estate Officer to hold inquiries. Section 9 of the Act provides that an appeal shall lie from specified orders of the estate officer to an Appellate Officer.  The question before the High Court was regarding which authority can be an Appellate Officer.  The Petitioners herein had raised an objection that in view of Section 9 of the Act, the appeal can be heard either by the District Judge or by a judicial officer in that district having not less than 10 years service as Additional District Judge.  However, the High Court noted that a bare perusal of Section 9 of the Act provides that the Appellate Officer shall be the District Judge of the district in which the public premises is situated or such other judicial officer in that district of not less than 10 years standing.  "Reading of this provision nowhere provides that a judicial officer to be competent to hear the appeal must have a standing of 10 years or more than 10 years in service as an Additional District Judge," Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma held.  The Court held that if the legislature intended so, it could have mentioned it in the provision itself.  Similarly, there is nothing as such in the provision that states that the judicial officer should have a service of 10 years or more than 10 years in the Higher Judicial Service, it added.  Thus, the appeals were relegated back to the concerned Court.  Case Title: M/S Young Men S Tennis Club v. NDMC

The Supreme Court on Friday (September 17, 2021) observed that a registered sale deed cannot be cancelled unilaterally by one party to the said document in purported compliance of the direction given by the High Court, since that adversely affects the rights of the purchasers who are not a party before the High Court. The bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana, Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli in the present matter was hearing a special leave petition filed assailing the order dated June 8, 2021 by the High Court of Telangana wherein the High Court while granting anticipatory bail had directed the accused to cancel the registered sale deed executed by him and return the money received from the complainant. "The petitioner/accused shall cooperate in the investigation and shall furnish all the registered documents before the investigating authorities and he shall take steps to cancel the registered sale deeds executed in favour of the vendees within two months from today, and shall also return the consideration amount received through the said registered sale deeds within two months from today, failing which, liberty granted to the petitioner shall stand cancelled automatically and he shall be taken into custody forthwith," condition by High Court read. Aggrieved by the said condition, the accused had approached the Top Court. Opining that ends of justice would be met if the said condition was deleted from the impugned order, the bench noted while modifying the order,  "We are, prima facie, of the considered view that the High Court ought not to have imposed the said Condition No. 
The Allahabad High Court today rejected the bail plea of the alleged Popular Front of India (PFI) leader Abdul Razaq Peediyakkal in the PMLA Case wherein he has been accused of collecting and laundering funds over Rs. 20 crores for the PFI.  The bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan rejected the bail plea today. A detailed copy of the order is awaited.  It may be noted that the ED raided Peediyakkal’s residence as well as the Munnar Villa Vista Project (MVVP) site in December 2021 wherein it found several discrepancies in the receipt of suspicious foreign funds from abroad and also in cash expenses incurred and recorded in the books of accounts.  Thereafter he was arrested and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a chargesheet against him and his co-accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) before the Special PMLA Court in Lucknow.  The chargesheet filed by the ED states that they hatched a conspiracy to raise funds in India as well as abroad for the purpose of using the same for PFI’s unlawful activities.  The ED has also alleged that Peediyakkal was the largest shareholder of the Munnar Villa Vista Project (MVVP), which was set up allegedly with the motive to launder money collected from abroad and in India.   In the ED’s chargesheet, it has also been alleged that he owned some other companies as well and they were being used to collect funds to be utilized for the PFI’s activities.

The Supreme Court reiterated that brief reasons must be given in an order disposing an application for leave to appeal under Section 378 ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 against an order of acquittal. Merely observing that the order of the trial Judge has taken a possible view without an application of mind to the evidence and the findings is not consistent with the duty which is cast upon the High Court while determining whether leave should be granted to appeal against an order of acquittal, the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said. The court set aside an order passed by Allahabad High Court in a leave application against acquittal and remanded the matter back. In this case, the appellant's contention was that while considering an application for the grant of leave to appeal against the order of acquittal, the High Court was required to scrutinize the evidence and findings and to determine as to whether leave should be granted to appeal. We are of the view that the impugned judgment of the High Court does not meet the requirements which are to be observed, consistent with the provisions of Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, where the High Court hears an application for leave to appeal against an order of acquittal, the bench said after perusing the impugned order. Referring to State of Madhya Pradesh vs Giriraj Dubey, State of Orissa vs Dhaniram Luhar and Chaman Lal vs State of Himachal Pradesh, the bench said: 6...The High Court must set forth its reasons, indicating at least in brief, an application of mind to the nature of the evidence and the findings which have been arrived at. In other words, merely observing that the order of the trial Judge has taken a possible view without an application of mind to the evidence and the findings is not consistent with the duty which is cast upon the High Court while determining whether leave should be granted to appeal against an order of acquittal. Observing thus, the bench remitted the matter back to High Court for fresh consideration.      
The Karnataka High Court has quashed the proceedings pending under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, against two officials of a logistics company on holding that they were unaware that the driver of the transport vehicle is carrying contraband.  A single judge bench of Justice P N Desai sitting at Kalaburagi allowed the petition filed by the Manager and MD of Nitco Logistic Pvt Ltd.  The bench said, "The charge sheet materials, allegations against these petitioners, the statement of the driver, the contents of the panchnama and Sections referred above, it is evident that these petitioners cannot be prosecuted as they have nothing to do with the said alleged offences. Therefore, continuing the proceedings against them is nothing but abuse of process of law and Court."  On receiving secret information, the Excise Inspector intercepted the company's shipment vehicle and found contraband (500 grams poppy straw powder) in fertiliser bags, behind the driver's seat. The accused were arrested and said powder and vehicle were seized. The police registered the complaint and after completing investigation, filed a charge sheet against the driver as well as the Petitioners herein. At the outset, the bench noted that there is nothing to show that these petitioners either knew the owners of the said logistic or they had knowingly permitted driver to transport such contraband substance. It observed,  "When the accused No.1 - driver himself stated that owners of the vehicle or owners of the goods were not knowing that he is transporting the said contraband substance, the question of prosecuting these petitioners does not arise at all." The Petitioners had argued that goods loaded in the vehicle were all as per the supporting invoices and nothing was recovered from the shipment container, which is locked after loading and is opened only at the place of unloading by giving one time lock password. The contraband was recovered from the driver's cabin and they had no knowledge of the same. The State on the other hand contended that whether the petitioners were having knowledge or not, is to be proved at the time of trial, not at this stage.  Case Title: SUNIL KUMAR KOUSHIK & ANR v.

The Madras High Court recently quashed FIR against a man booked under the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 for possessing ganja after observing that there were serious lapses on the part of the investigating officer.  Justice G Jayachandran observed that the seized contraband had not been tested for its content even after 5 years. Further, in spite of directions by the court, the Investigating Officer had not taken steps to number the final report.  This attitude of the Investigating Officer who has registered the case, clearly indicates that the case is not registered based on true facts. It is for the Senior Official to look into this case and take appropriate action for registering the complaint and not proceeding further in accordance with law, the court observed. Seeing that the offence is punishable to the extent of 1 year and there is failure to file the final report within a period of one year, the Cort was of the opinion that the case is hit by law of limitation as prescribed under Section 468 CrPC.  In view of the fact that more than 1 year has lapsed after registering the complaint and the maximum punishment for possession of 0.650 grams of ganja is up to one year, the complaint suffers limitation prescribed under Section 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code.  Background The petitioner was arrested by the Inspector of Police based on a suo moto criminal complaint. A polythene bag carried by him was seized and after examination, it was found that the petitioner was carrying ganja leaves and flower buds weighing around 0.650 grams.  When a previous application was filed to quash the FIR alleging that the case was false, the court was informed that the police had already completed investigation and had filed the final report. However the same was yet to be taken on file and numbered. The court had thus directed the respondent police to get the final report numbered within two weeks. Even though this direction was passed way back in 2018, the Petitioner contended that till date, the final report has not seen the light of day. It was submitted that the contraband seized had also not seen the light of day. Thus, the petitioner contended that the case was registered with malicious intent. The court was satisfied that the samples were neither sent to lab for testing even though the Magistrate had ordered for the same, nor were they produced before the court under Form 95. Thus, finding lapses in the investigation the court quash the proceedings. Case Title: Murali v.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that a judicial magistrate is not competent to order re-investigation in a case nor is he empowered to transfer the case from one investigating agency to another.  Justice M A Chowdhary observed, "No other Court except the Superior /Constitutional Courts is vested with the powers to order reinvestigation or transfer investigation of a case from one agency to another, to secure the ends of justice." The remarks were made while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had sought quashing of an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Jammu directing SP Crime Branch to re-investigate a case against petitioner for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, Section 471 of the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC).  In the instant matter, based on a complaint filed by one Beero Devi against petitioner, Kamlesh Devi before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jammu, (Special Mobile Magistrate Passenger Tax and Shops Act) under Section 156(3) CrPC the Court had directed the Police to conduct investigation.  Subsequently a case was registered and after collecting the material/documentary evidence and recording the statements of witnesses, it was found that the allegations levelled in the complaint were false, manipulated and without any basis. Hence, the Police considered it a fit case to proceed against the complainant under Section 182 CrPC for having lodged a false and frivolous case.  Thereafter, the police filed a closure report before the CJM of Jammu who transferred the case to another Judicial Magistrate (Special Mobile Magistrate Passenger Tax and Shops Act) for disposal under law. Special Mobile Magistrate then issued summons to complainant Beero Devi and recorded her statement wherein she deposed that she was not satisfied with the investigation and, therefore, the same should be transferred to the Crime Branch Jammu.  As a consequence the Judicial Magistrate by an order dated July 28, 2010 transferred the investigation of the case from Kanachak Police Station, Jammu to Crime Branch, Jammu relying on Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) 202, dated June 3, 1999 with the understanding that the Crime Branch Jammu was empowered to carry out the investigation in a case of forgery.  Challenging the order of transfer counsel for the petitioner contended that the Magistrate was not competent to direct re-investigation of the case to be carried out by a different police agency. Counsel further submitted that even the Crime Branch was not competent to investigate the matter in terms of SRO 202 which does not empower the Crime Branch to investigate any offences which is not scheduled in the Annexure to SRO.  The moot questions that fell for adjudication were:-  i) whether a judicial Magistrate is competent to transfer the investigation of the case from local police station to Crime Branch of the police agency; and  ii) whether the Crime Branch was competent to conduct investigation of a case regarding forgery of certificate as per the directions of the Magistrate.  Deliberating on the first issue, Justice Chowdhary observed that no court except the superior/Constitutional courts is vested with the powers to order re-investigation or transfer investigation of a case from one agency to another.  In its bid to answer the second question the bench observed that the government of J&K through Home Department had issued SRO 202 specifying the classes of cases to be investigated by the crime branch within J&K for the purposes of registration and investigation.  The bench further noted that the Crime Branch can also register other cases for investigation which may be referred to it by the government or Director General of Police from time to time as per the notification (SRO 202).  Discussing the matter further the bench explained that in terms of the above, the assignment of the cases to the Crime Branch can take place either by the government or by the DGP, and therefore the judicial magistrate was not competent to transfer investigation of the case from one investigating agency to other.  In view of the the discussion above the Court quashed the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Jammu (Special Mobile Magistrate Passenger Tax and Shops Act) and upheld the order to the extent not accepting the closure report filed by the Police Station Kanachak.

The Calcutta High Court last week reiterated that in matters of custody, welfare of child must be of utmost consideration. Accordingly, it upheld removal of a child from his mother's custody on the basis of the child's hand-written letter regarding neglect and ill-treatment. Justice Shivakant Prasad opined that the welfare of a minor would triumph all other considerations by observing, "Thus, it is well-settled law in the matter of custody of the child that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child and not right of the parents."  He ordered that in the interest of child's welfare, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) Kolkata shall continue to keep the minor in their lawful custody. It however directed CWC to give visiting right to both the child's mother and father, on alternative days.  Background:  In the instant case, the petitioner had alleged that the action taken by the CWC in removing the minor from the custody of his natural guardian was wholly unlawful and unwarranted. As a result, the petitioner prayed before the Court to issue an interlocutory order under Section 12 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 to reinstate the temporary custody of the child with the petitioner. She submitted that consequent to the dissolution of her marriage, she had been granted custody of her minor son. The West Bengal Legal Services Authority had on the other hand placed on record a hand-written complaint of the minor son of the petitioner, reported through her ex-husband. In the letter, the minor child had alleged that his mother was negligent towards him and also complained of ill-treatment. The petitioner questioned the authenticity of the signature and handwriting on the aforementioned letter Accordingly, the Court had personally interrogated the minor child consequent to which the child had intimated the Court about his unwillingness to return to the custody of his mother. Observations: At the outset, the Court opined that the CWC had taken over the custody of the concerned minor through lawful means by adhering to the procedure enumerated in Clause 9 of NALSA (Child Friendly Legal Services to Children and Their Protection) Scheme, 2015. Further, it was observed that such a measure was taken by the CWC pursuant to the directions of the Member Secretary of NALSA.  Refuting the contentions of the petitioner, the Court noted,  "Therefore, it cannot be said that the interim custody of the child being the son of the petitioner, Sagnic, was taken by respondent No. 2 or it's official in an illegal manner because it was on the basis of a written complaint by the son himself and I have ascertained the signature and his mind as well to prima facie find that the child is not willing to go with the mother." Furthermore, the Court placed reliance on the Supreme Court judgment of Nilratan Kundu v. Avijit Kundu to rule that in the instant case the welfare of the child would be guaranteed if he continues to remain in the custody of the safe house allocated by the CWC.  Accordingly, the Court disposed of the petition by directing both parties i.e. the petitioner and her ex-husband, the father of the child, to deposit a sum of Rs. 20,000/- individually for the welfare of the child as he continues to be in the interim custody of the safe home. Further, the Court extended visitation rights to both the parents.  Case Title: Nilanjala Ghosal v. State of West Bengal    
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has reiterated that Muslim female aged 15 years and above can marry a person of her choice on her own willingness and consent, and such a marriage would not be void in terms of Section 12 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006. The observation was made while hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by 26 years old Javed against detention of his 16 years old wife in children's home.  The Court held that their marriage is valid as per Mohammedan Law and that the custody of the detenue legally rested with the petitioner.  It was the case of the petitioner that his marriage with his wife was performed with the free will of both the parties and since both the parties were Muslims, there marriage was valid, despite the detenue otherwise being a minor and below the age of 18 years.    The petitioner placed reliance on Yunus Khan v. State of Haryana and Others 2014 (3) RCR (Criminal) 518 in support of his argument that, in the present circumstances of both the parties being Muslims and having performed Nikah, the custody of the detenue should be handed over to the petitioner.   The respondent State, on the other hand, argued that the petition was liable to be dismissed since the detenue was a minor. They submitted that being less than 18 years of age, she was rightly being kept in a children's home – Ashiana.    The single bench of Justice Vikas Bahl, after looking at the relevant documents, the legal authorities and the statement of the detenue made under Section 164 of CrPC, ordered the release of the detenue from Ashiana and for the transfer of her custody to the petitioner.   The Court relied on the decision in Yunus Khan to reach its finding that the marriage between the petitioner and the detenue was a valid one, both the parties being Muslims. Referring to the law laid down in that case, the Court proceeded to observe that the facts of the present matter had to be subjected to the same legal principles. The court noted:   "A perusal of the above said judgment would show that a coordinate Bench of this Court in the above said judgment had observed that the marriage of a Muslim girl continues to be governed by the personal law of Muslims and has relied upon the Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla, more so Article 195 thereof, and after considering the same, it has been observed that 15 years is the age of puberty of a Muslim female, and on her own willingness and consent, after attaining puberty (15 years of age) can marry a person of her choice and such a marriage would not be void in terms of Section 12 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006."

A division bench of J&K&L High Court today ruled that in absence of any misrepresentation on the part of the petitioner with regard to factum of seeking her promotion, no recovery, whatsoever, can be made from her retirement benefit or for that matter her promotion cannot be withdrawn.

A division bench of J&K&L High Court today ruled that in absence of any misrepresentation on the part of the petitioner with regard to factum of seeking her promotion, no recovery, whatsoever, can be made from her retirement benefit or for that matter her promotion cannot be withdrawn. A bench comprising Justices Tashi Rabstan & Wasim Sadiq Nargal observed  "By no stretch of imagination, consequential benefits can be taken at this belated stage, when she is drawing the pension after retirement:"  The bench was hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner was challenging a notice issued to her by the Respondent-BSNL, wherein she was asked to show cause as to why her promotion to the post of Jr. Accounts Officer made on 16.12.2013 may not be withdrawn.  Among several other grounds the petitioner pleaded that she had opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme way back in 2019 and her pension had been fixed on the basis of last pay drawn as that of Accounts Officer in terms of the Pension Payment Order and hence the impugned show cause notice by no stretch of imagination can sustain in the eyes of law.  After perusing the available record the bench observed that that although show cause notice was issued on 05.02.2018 with a view to withdraw her promotion as Junior Accounts Officer given on 16.12.2013, then subsequently, how and under what circumstances, the petitioner was further promoted in the grade of Accounts Officer on 29.06.2018 by the respondents has not been explained nor respondents could justify their stand.  "We fail to understand that, once the show cause notice has been issued with regard to her promotion as Junior Accounts Officer, then subsequently how and under what circumstances, she was promoted in the grade of Accounts Officer, that too, pursuant to the approval of the competent authority." the bench noted.  Adjudicating the matter the bench further observed that if an excess amount was not paid on account of any misrepresentation or fraud of the employee and rather it was by applying a wrong principle or interpretation of rule/ order which is subsequently found to be erroneous, such excess payment of emoluments or allowances are not recoverable subsequently after retirement.  The bench also found it worthwhile to record the apex court observations in Sahib Ram v. State of Haryana and Others, 1995 Supp (1) SCC 18 wherein SC while restraining such recovery observed..  "The appellant does not possess the required educational qualifications. Under the circumstances the appellant would not be entitled to the relaxation. The Principal erred in granting him the relaxation. Since the date of relaxation, the appellant had been paid his salary on the revised scale. However, it is not on account of any misrepresentation made by the appellant that the benefit of the higher pay scale was given to him but by wrong construction made by the Principal for which the appellant cannot be held to be at fault. Under the circumstances the amount paid till date may not be recovered from the appellant".  Deliberating further on the subject the bench observed that the pensioners are on a better footing than the in-service employees and such pensioners can seek a direction that wrong payment should not be recovered, as pensioners are in a more disadvantageous position when compared to in service employees, any attempt to recover an excess wrong payment would cause undue hardship to them.  In view of the position of law discussed above the bench allowed the writ petition and set aside the impugned show cause notice.  Case Title: Sonam Dolma Vs Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited & Ors.   
In a case dating back to 1999, the Delhi High Court has set aside the life sentence of a murder convict after he took the plea of juvenility during the pendency of his appeal. The ossification test revealed that his age was between 10 to 20 years old on the day of incident. "Considering the fact that the upper age limit cannot be taken to the detriment of the appellant and as per the lower limit, the appellant was a minor at the time of alleged incident, he is entitled to the benefit of juvenility. The appellant was convicted for offences punishable under Sections 302/452 IPC as noted above. Maintaining the conviction of the appellant for the said offences, which is not being challenged on merits before this Court, the order on sentence is set aside," said the court. The division bench of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Anish Dayal in the judgment dated November 23 further observed that in any case the conviction "will have no disqualification at any stage against the appellant in terms of Section 24 of the J.J.Act." The convict had been in custody for nearly five years and five months when his sentence was directed to be suspended on April 13 in 2005. "Even as a juvenile the period of protective custody for rehabilitation that could be awarded was three years. Hence, this Court finds no ground to remand the matter to the Juvenile Justice Board on the order on sentence in terms of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported as (2013) 11 SCC 193 Jitendra Singh Vs. State of U.P," the court said. The appellant in 2005 had challenged the trial court decision of July 5, 2004 by which the accused was convicted for offences punishable under Sections 302 and 452 IPC. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on July 9, 2005. In 2019, he took the plea of juvenility before the high court. Since the Supreme Court in Hari Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan and Anr held that the benefit of the increase of the age of the juvenility to 18 years introduced by the JJ Act of 2000 will apply retrospectively, it was thus to be determined whether the appellant had completed 18 years of age on the date of alleged commission of offence to avail the benefit of the J.J. Act, the court noted. The bench had earlier remanded the matter to the trial court for determination of the age of appellant as on November 6 in 1999 - the date of incident. Since neither the date of birth from the school nor the certificate issued by the municipal corporation was available, a medical board was constituted by the Additional Sessional Judge in December 2019. The medical board conducted physical, radiological and dental as also orthopedic examinations of the appellant. Though the appellant had also submitted his Aadhaar and PAN cards, they were not considered. "The appellant also had submitted his Aadhar Card and PAN Card whereby his date of birth was mentioned as 1st January 1983. However, the said documents were not on the basis of any record from the school or municipal authority. Hence, in terms of Section 94 of the J.J.Act, the age of the appellant will have to be ascertained as per the ossification test conducted and opined by the Medical Board to be between 30 to 40 years as on 18th December 2019, which makes the age of the appellant on the date of incident i.e. 6th November 1999 to be between 10 years to 20 years," the bench said, while granting relief to the convict.

The Allahabad High Court (Lucknow bench) quashed a criminal case against four real brothers, and their father, aged around 81 years who were booked for allegedly gang-raping a married woman, having two grown-up children The bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed that it was not believable that four real brothers and their father would commit rape on a woman having two grown up children. Essentially, the Court was hearing a 482 CrPC plea moved by the accused persons seeking to quash the criminal proceedings initiated in the year 2014 in the instant case against them. The police had, after investigating in the matter, submitted a final report exonerating the petitioners and their father for committing the offence. However, since the prosecutrix was not satisfied with the said final report, she filed a complaint before the Uttar Pradesh State Women Commission. The Commission directed the Superintendent of Police, Kheri to submit a detailed report in the matter. In its report, Superintendent of Police, Kheri specifically stated that the case set up by the prosecutrix was completely a false case. It was further stated in the report that the prosecutrix wanted to persecute the petitioners with malafide intention, and the report lodged by the prosecutrix was in retaliation for the report lodged against her husband and other relatives.  It was also said that the Investigating Officer after investing the offence, found that the case set up by the prosecutrix was completely a false case and a recommendation was made to take action under section 182 I.P.C. against the prosecutrix. Meanwhile, against the final report exonerating the petitioners, the prosecutrix filed a protest petition, which was treated as a complaint case and after recording the statements of the prosecutrix and witnesses, the petitioners were summoned to face the trial for the offences under sections 366, 452 and 376 I.P.C.  Taking into account the facts of the case, the Court came to a conclusion that as a measure of retaliation and vengeance, the prosecutrix had lodged these proceedings though the police did not find any evidence for the commission of the offence by the four real brothers and their father. "Considering all these facts and also taking into account the report submitted by the Superintendent of Police, Kheri to the Uttar Pradesh State Women Commission, Lucknow, this court finds that the impugned proceedings are nothing but an abuse of process of the court to falsely implicate the petitioners, who are the real brothers, and their father, aged around 81 years for the offence under section 376 I.P.C," the Court observed as it allowed the plea. In view thereof, the petition was allowed and the impugned proceedings of Sessions Trial pending in the court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Lakhimpur Kheri were quashed.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Monday ruled that merely because proceedings have been initiated by a wife against her husband under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (DV Act), no bar can be construed against lodging an first information report (FIR) for cruelty under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The observations were made by a bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea filed by petitioner-husband challenging the FIR registered against him under Sections 498A and 109 of IPC on the basis of a complaint filed by his wife-complainant. Single-judge Justice Sanjay Dhar said that the scope of proceedings under Section 12 of the DV Act and the scope of criminal proceedings initiated pursuant to lodging of FIR for cruelty under IPC are entirely different. "While in proceedings under Section 12 of the DV Act, the victim of domestic violence can be awarded monetary compensation and she can also be given certain protective orders in her favour, but the criminal proceedings are intended to punish the perpetrator of a crime, may be a matrimonial crime. So, the provisions of DV Act and IPC act in different fields," the Court said. The petitioner had premised the challenge on the ground that the allegations made in the FIR were absolutely vexatious and with a view to victimise and harass the petitioner and his family members. The petitioner also contended that since the wife had already filed an application under Section 12 of DV Act, she cannot be allowed to lodge an FIR against the petitioner-husband and his relatives for Section 498A offence. The petitioner argued that all his relatives including his parents and brother-in-law have been roped in the FIR which shows that the wife (respondent No. 3) only intends to harass the petitioner. Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Dhar observed that merely because the wife has filed an application under DV Act, she cannot be debarred from lodging FIR against the petitioner for investigating the acts of cruelty alleged to have been perpetrated by her husband against her.  Deliberating on the contention of the petitioner that there are no specific allegations against him in the impugned FIR, the court said that the allegations made in the impugned FIR are very specific in nature as regards the role of petitioner. It has been specifically stated in the FIR that the petitioner made demands of cash and car from respondent No. 3 and it has also been specifically stated that the petitioner used to physically and mentally torture her in connection with demands of dowry, hence the above Conte is without merit, the court added.  Commenting on the unnecessary roping in of relatives of the petitioner in the impugned FIR, the court said that this ground may be available to the relatives of the petitioner and not to the petitioner i.e. husband of respondent No. 3. Accordingly the bench dismissed the petition, finding it without any merit.  Case Title: Danish Chauhan Vs DGP J&K

The Gujarat High Court has clarified that occupiers of a land cannot be denied electricity connection only because a dispute regarding ownership of the land is pending. Justice AS Supehia referred to a division bench judgment stating that right and title and ownership or right of occupancy has no nexus with grant of electrical connection to a consumer.  The Petitioners, current occupiers of the land, submitted that they were denied an electricity connection only because the land that they were occupying was in the name of the Government. The Mamlatdar had initiated proceedings against them u/s 61 of the Gujarat Land Revenue Code for removal of encroachment. To bolster their contention, the Petitioners relied on an order of the High Court and Sec 43 of the Electricity Act, 2003 which mandates the supply of electricity to any owner or occupier of premises. The Petitioners could be said to be 'occupier' of the land in question and the Respondent authorities could not deny the connection.  Justice Supehia noted that the Petitioners were owners of the concerned agricultural land for which electricity was sought. However, electricity was denied on the ground that the Petitioners were illegally occupying Government land.   Perusing Sec 43, Justice Supehia concluded that the provision stipulated that the licensee shall supply electricity to those premises where the application had been filed by the owner or the occupier. Subsequently, reference was made to the order of the Division Bench of the High Court in LPA No. 91/2010 wherein it was observed:  "Such power being not vested under the law with the company and as the company cannot decide the disputed question of right and title, we are of the view that ownership or right of occupancy has no nexus with grant of electrical connection to a consumer."  Keeping in view the aforesaid provisions, Justice Supehia directed the Respondent-Company to supply electricity connection to the Petitioners in the premises of the property at the earliest in accordance with the list maintained by the name containing the names of the Petitioners.

The Supreme Court observed that demand of money for construction of a house is a 'dowry demand' to attract offence under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code.The word "Dowry" ought to be ascribed an expansive meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature, the bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justice AS Bopanna and Hima... The Supreme Court observed that demand of money for construction of a house is a 'dowry demand' to attract offence under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code. The word "Dowry" ought to be ascribed an expansive meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature, the bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justice AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli said. In this case, the Trial Court convicted  husband and father-in-law of the deceased under Sections 304-B, 306 and 498-A IPC. It was found that the accused had been demanding money from the deceased for constructing a house which her family members were unable to give and as a result, she was constantly harassed and subjected to cruelty, finally leading to her committing suicide. In appeal, the High Court held that held that the demand of money for construction of a house cannot be treated as a demand for dowry. The court observed that the offence under Section 304-B was not established against them as the demand allegedly made on the deceased was for money to construct a house, which cannot be treated as a dowry demand for connecting her death to the said cause.  The Apex Court bench, in its judgment delivered appeal filed by the State, listed four pre-requisites for convicting an accused for the offence punishable under Section 304- B as follows:  (i) that the death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurred otherwise than under normal circumstance; (ii) that such a death must have occurred within a period of seven years of her marriage; (iii) that the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment at the hands of her husband, soon before her death; and (iv) that such a cruelty or harassment must have been for or related to any demand for dowry Disagreeing with the view adopted by the High Court, the bench observed: "13. The Latin maxim "Ut Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat" i.e, a liberal construction should be put up on written instruments, so as to uphold them, if possible, and carry into effect, the intention of the parties, sums it up. Interpretation of a provision of law that will defeat the very intention of the legislature must be shunned in favour of an interpretation that will promote the object sought to be achieved through the legislation meant to uproot a social evil like dowry demand. In this context the word "Dowry" ought to be ascribed an expansive meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature. When dealing with cases under Section 304-B IPC, a provision legislated to act as a deterrent in the society and curb the heinous crime of dowry demands, the shift in the approach of the courts ought to be from strict to liberal, from constricted to dilated. Any rigid meaning would tend to bring to naught, the real object of the provision. Therefore, a push in the right direction is required to accomplish the task of eradicating this evil which has become deeply entrenched in our society" The bench said that the trial Court has correctly interpreted the demand for money raised by the respondents on the deceased for construction of a house as falling within the definition of the word "dowry".  "The submission made by learned counsel for the respondents that the deceased was also a party to such a demand as she had on her own asked her mother and maternal uncle to contribute to the construction of the house, must be understood in the correct perspective. It cannot be lost sight of that the respondents had been constantly tormenting the deceased and asking her to approach her family members for money to build a house and it was only on their persistence and insistence that she was compelled to ask them to contribute some amount for constructing a house. The Court must be sensitive to the social milieu from which the parties hail.", the court said. Holding thus, the bench restored the conviction of the accused under Section 304B IPC.

Emphasising on the growing need of qualified doctors in the country, the Delhi High Court has observed that deserving medical colleges must not be unfairly denied the opportunity to contribute in enhancing the strength of medical professionals. Justice Sanjeev Narula said that augmentation of medical infrastructure is crucial, and hence, the role of regulatory bodies like National Medical Commission (NMC) is "unquestionably significant." "The authorisation procedure must indeed be strictly adhered to ensure that there is no decline in the quality of medical education. However, at the same time, deserving colleges must not be unfairly denied the opportunity to contribute in enhancing the strength of medical professionals," the court said.  The observations were made by Justice Narula in his judgment on a petition moved by Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan Medical College and Hospital, a Tamil Nadu based institute, for increase of MBBS seats to 250 from 150. The college is affiliated with Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University, Chennai. On December 31 last year, the Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) of NMC recommended an increase of 50 seats, taking the total strength to 200. However, being aggrieved by the partial relief, an appeal was preferred before the First Appeal Committee, which was dismissed on February 21 this year.  The committee not only disagreed with MARB but also declined the request for increasing seats in entirety. The original sanctioned intake of 150 seats was restored with observations on certain deficiencies in teaching faculty and occupancy of hospital beds. The second appeal preferred before the Central Government was dismissed on March 17. On March 30, the court passed an interim order on the college's petition, permitting it to participate in counselling rounds of NEET UG 2021-22 and admit 50 more students in the MBBS course. However, it was clarified that interim permission will not preclude NMC from initiating any action against the college in respect of purported deficiencies. In respect of the academic year 2022-23, a surprise inspection of the college was conducted by the NMC and a report was prepared wherein the college was found compliant with existing norms in all aspects for 200 seats, except for a minor deficiency in teaching staff.  While the NMC argued that college cannot be granted approval for 250 seats, the counsel representing the medical institution argued that it is fully equipped for increase up to 250 seats. It was further submitted that the NMC was deliberately denying the college the benefit.  Considering there was a minor deficiency of only 0.49 percent in the teaching staff, the court on October 13 directed the NMC to file an affidavit explaining the criteria for relaxation of deficiencies up to 5% in private medical colleges. In its response, NMC confirmed that the relaxation of upto 5% on faculty strength was applicable to the college in question, however, it added that if existing facilities available with college as per the MARB inspection report are to be considered for 250 seats, faculty deficiency would substantially increase from 0.49% to 6.9%, which is beyond the permissible limit of 5%. Analysing the assertions of NMC regarding deficiencies for grant of 250 seats in its affidavit, Justice Narula the inspection report points out to deficiency of only one associate professor in the orthopaedic department of the college. However, it added, when the report is applied for 250 seats, the deficiency would be of 14 faculty members. "Nonetheless, as against required strength of 202, since Petitioner college would be entitled to the benefit of relaxation norms, it is required to have minimum strength of 192 teachers [i.e., 202 - 10 (5% of 202 seats)]," said the court. The court said the NMC recorded a shortage of three faculty members in the dentistry department. However, it added that the MBBS Regulations, 2020 state that a separate department of Dental Faculty is not required where a dental college is available in the same campus or city and is run by the same management. "The shortage of teachers in dentistry department being reckoned as deficiency is a flawed conclusion. The alleged deficiency of 3 faculty members must therefore be reduced from the figure of 14. In fact, the Court perceives NMC's stance of including the dental faculty towards total deficiencies as an attempt to mislead the Court," it added. The court also rejected NMC's argument regarding shortage in physiology department and said the same has no lawful footing. Regarding the microbiology department, the court said NMC has disregarded 2 assistant professors who were on maternity leave while ascertaining the deficiencies. It said such an approach is contrary to law and outrightly fallacious. It also rejected the claim regarding deficiency in General Surgery.  Observing that the college fulfils the criteria for increasing its seats to 250 as per the applicable norms, Justice Narula said deficiencies in teaching staff of Petitioner college are far less than what NMC has portrayed, and is well within permissible or relaxation limit of 5%.  "NMC's assertions, based on MARB's (expert assessors) findings, of deficiency of 6.9% in faculty, is demonstrably misconceived and erroneous. Petitioner college fulfils the criteria for increasing its admission capacity in MBBS course from 150 to 250, as per applicable norms," the court said. The court therefore confirmed the interim order and held the petitioner college to be entitled to 200 seats for academic year 2021-22. Allowing the prayer with regard to the 2022-23 academic sessions, the court directed Centre and NMC to permit the college to take admissions of 250 students in the ongoing counselling of NEET UG 2022, adding that the order be intimated to competent authority or body of the Tamil Nadu Government to add 250 seats in its seat matrix. HC Orders Enquiry The court said there was a deliberate effort on the part of NMC to somehow justify its entirely untenable, unsustainable and ex-facie arbitrary action of artificially raising deficiency in faculty to 6.9 percent. "In the present case, NMC through its acts of omission and commission, has not only violated the norms laid down under relevant regulations, but also completely disregarded the legislative and policy decisions of the Government by issuance of afore-noted impugned orders," Justice Narula said. Calling NMC's actions in the case highly questionable, Justice Narula said that instead of assisting the court, the additional affidavit - filed pursuant to his directions, presented non-existent deficiencies, based on "false and erroneous facts, in an attempt to deny Petitioner college, the relief it is entitled to, under law." Observing NMC must not lose sight of its responsibility to maintain accuracy of facts or information presented to the court, Justice Narula directed the Chairperson of NMC to enquire into the circumstances that resulted in filing of the additional affidavit with inaccurate facts and also to take appropriate action in the matter.

The Allahabad High Court has allowed an application of the Public Prosecutor for 'Withdrawal From Prosecution' (as provided under Section 321 CrPC) against UP BJP MLA Prem Narayan Pandey in connection with a case registered against him under the UP Excise Act. With this, the Court set aside the judgment and order passed by the Additional Session Judge, Special Judge (M.P./M.L.A.), Gonda (in November 2020) rejecting the plea of the public prosecutor.  It may be noted that while rejecting the application, the Court concerned had noted that no documentary material had been put forth demonstrating that such withdrawal (from prosecution) was in the interest of public justice. #JustIN | The #AllahabadHighCourt has allowed plea for 'Withdrawal From Prosecution' against UP BJP MLA Prem Narayan Pandey (@premnarayanmla) in connection with a case under the UP Excise Act. pic.twitter.com/TLqfZwqPCh— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 17, 2023 Noting that the order of November 2020 suffers from apparent illegality and perversity, the bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan set it aside and allowed the application filed by the PP under Section 321 CrPC. "The learned trial court may not examine the purpose for what the application for withdrawal of the prosecution has been filed inasmuch as the withdrawal from prosecution is an executive function of the Public Prosecutor. The discretion to withdraw from the prosecution is solely that of the Public Prosecutor and so he cannot surrender that discretion to someone else," the Court observed in its operative part of the order. The case in brief The case against MLA Pandey is that in the year 2003, he was found in possession of liquor in contravention of Sections 60 and 72 of the UP Excise Act. Thereafter, criminal proceedings were initiated against him before the court concerned. Now, in November 2019, an application under Section 321 Cr.P.C. was filed before the trial court concerned by the Assistant Public Prosecutor (Criminal). After the same was rejected, Paney moved the High Court seeking various prayers including quashing of entire criminal proceedings, allowing the PP's application, etc. Before the Court, Pandey's counsel argued that the nature of the case which is sought to be withdrawn would not affect the society at large, thus, such withdrawal would not be against public justice. Relying upon the Apex Court's rulings, it was also submitted that the Public Prosecutor may withdraw from prosecution not merely on the ground of paucity of evidence but on other relevant ground as well as in order to further the broad ends of public justice, public order and peace. On the other hand, the Additional Government Advocates also submitted that the trial court has erred in passing the impugned order by indicating that the prosecution could not file any document/ material to convince the court to withdraw the prosecution against the present applicant.  Significantly, the Court was also apprised of the fact that the trial court earlier this month rejected the discharge application of the petitioner which was filed pursuant to the order of the HC. Against this backdrop, taking into account the pleadings of both parties, the Court noted that if the Public Prosecutor is able to show that he may not be able to produce sufficient evidence sustaining the charges, an application for withdrawal from the prosecution may be legitimately filed by him. Further, stressing that the ultimate guiding consideration while granting permission to withdraw from prosecution must always be the interest of the administration of justice. The Court also referred to Supreme Court's ruling in the case of State of Kerala vs. K. Ajith and others LL 2021 SC 328. "The court performs a supervisory function and has a special duty in granting its consent to the withdrawal. The courts duty is not to reappreciate the grounds which led the Public Prosecutor to request the withdrawal from the prosecution but to consider whether the Public Prosecutor applied his mind as a free agent. The Court has a special duty in this regard as it is the ultimate repository of legislative confidence in granting or withholding its consent to withdrawal from the prosecution," the Court further observed as it found faults with the trial court's order and set it aside.

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday reserved judgment in the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition seeking postponement of municipal elections in Siliguri, Chandernagore, Bidhannagar and Asansol in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the State of West Bengal. The Court also took on record a report filed by the State government and the West Bengal State Election... The Calcutta High Court on Thursday reserved judgment in the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition seeking postponement of municipal elections in Siliguri, Chandernagore, Bidhannagar and Asansol in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the State of West Bengal.  The Court also took on record a report filed by the State government and the West Bengal State Election Commission detailing the Covid-19 situation in the 4 municipalities of the State wherein municipal elections are due to take place on January 22, 2022.  A Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj orally observed pursuant to the submissions of the concerned parties,  "We will consider and pass orders. The order will be uploaded on the website".  Submissions on behalf of the petitioner Senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya appearing for the petitioner on the other hand argued that the submissions of the State government do not repose much confidence as the spread of Covid-19 infection can take place despite such measures being taken. "If there is this sort of accumulation of people, then there will be a chance of spreading Covid-19 infection", the senior counsel submitted further.  He further submitted before the Court that there is close to 40 percent Covid-19 positivity rate in the State and thus the upcoming municipal elections must be deferred. He further pointed out to the Court that the report submitted by the State government and the State Election Commission do not reflect the opinion of medical authorities. He thus prayed for elections to be deferred by a month.  At this point, the Chief Justice enquired from the counsel, "Once elections are notified, what is the scope of interference by the State?" In response, the senior counsel remarked that the State Election Commission's power to defer elections is not disputed. He further argued that the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution can also defer municipal elections in extraordinary circumstances. In this regard, he placed reliance on the Supreme Court judgment in State of Goa v. Fouziya Imitaz Shaikh.  Submissions on behalf of the State government  The counsel appearing for the State government apprised the Bench that a substantial number of people have already been vaccinated in the concerned municipalities. He informed the Court that in Asansol, 98 percent of the people had been given the first dose of the vaccine and 72 percent of the people had been given the second dose of the vaccine and that the Covid-19 positivity rate is 16.4 percent. It was further submitted that in Chandernagore, 98 percent of the people had been given the first dose and 95 percent of the people had been administered the second dose of the vaccine and the covid-19 positivity rate is 9 percent.  The Court was further apprised that in Bidhannagar, 161 percent of the people had been administered the first dose and 109 percent of the people had been administered the second dose of the vaccine and that the Covid-19 positivity rate is 19.5 percent. Furthermore, in Siliguri, 123 percent of the people had been given the first dose and 92 percent of the people had been administered the second dose of the vaccine and that Covid-19 positivity rate is 16.9 percent.  At this point, the Chief Justice enquired, "In such a situation, should elections be conducted?" In response, the counsel submitted that he would seek further instructions about the State government's clear stance on this issue.  The State government further informed the Court that pursuant to Section 5(1) of the West Bengal State Election Commission Act, 1994, once the election dates have already been notified, the State government has no more role to play and that any further issue such as deferring of elections falls in the exclusive domain of the State Election Commission only.  Submissions on behalf of the State Election Commission  Senior advocate Jayanta Mitra appearing for the State Election Commission placed reliance on Section 8 of the West Bengal State Election Commission Act, 1994 and accordingly contended that the dates of the elections are fixed by the State Election Commission in consultation with the State government.  At this point, the Chief Justice questioned, "What do you want to submit that the hands of the State Election Commission are tied when it comes to deferring of elections?" In response, the senior counsel submitted that the State Election Commission has to consult the State government even with regards to deferment of elections. "Suo Moto the State Election Commission cannot take a decision" senior counsel Mitra submitted further. Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in State of Goa v. Fouziya Imitaz Shaikh in this regard.  At this point, the Chief Justice remarked, "We want clear submission..whether the Election Commission has the power and authority to defer the elections?" In response, the State Election Commission also categorically submitted before the Court that the Commission does not have the power to defer the election dates once the dates have been notified unless the State government declares such a disaster or an emergency which would make it impossible to hold such elections. It was further submitted that before taking any decision to defer the elections, the State Election Commission has to consult the State authorities in particular the State's Disaster Management Authority.  Furthermore, the Chief Justice directed the senior counsel to refer to Article 243ZA of the Constitution which enumerates, "The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to the Municipalities shall be vested in the State Election Commission referred to in article 243K". Accordingly, the Chief Justice remarked, "Inspite of this, your stand is that the State Election Commission cannot defer it?"  The senior counsel responded in the affirmative.  The Chief Justice further enquired from the State Election Commission as to whether sufficient number of persons free from Covid infection are available for deployment on different booths for the purpose of holding elections. In response, the Court was apprised that there are adequate number of polling personnel. It was further submitted that 12400 polling personnel have been deployed and 2800 polling personnel have been kept in reserve in case of emergency. The Court was also informed that adequate number of medical officers and ASHA workers have also been deployed in case of any medical emergency.  "All possible steps have been taken to ensure that security of people are not jeopardised", the senior counsel submitted further.  Case Title - Bimal Bhattacharya vs. State of West Bengal & Ors 
After stinging observations from the Bombay High Court, bike taxi aggregator Rapido undertook to close down all its services – bike taxi, rickshaw and food delivery in Maharashtra till January 20, 2023. Rapido informed the court that the app has now become inoperative in the state. "Ms. Sethna (for the petitioner) confirms that the app is now inoperative in Maharashtra. We however do clarify for the convenience of customers who may have booked rides before 1pm today, the petitioner may fulfill those obligations. This is only for the convenience of those consumers." A division bench of Justices GS Patel and Justice SG Dige told the petitioner it would dismiss the petition with costs if they refused to shut down their services after the bench was informed that Rapido doesn’t have license to operate any of these services. The court was hearing Rapido’s plea challenging the state’s refusal to grant licenses to entities like it. During the hearing, Advocate General Dr. Birendra Saraf insisted that if the petition is to be entertained, the petitioner be required to undertake that it will shut down its services first. The AG also told the court that a committee has been set up to explore the formulation of guidelines for bike taxis in the state. Further, state is in the process of initiating prosecution against entities like Uber who are operating bike taxis, he said. The court had earlier said that State cannot remain in a limbo when it comes to taking a decision in the matter. The court directed the petitioner to place on record the terms of the licenses it has obtained after Advocate Fereshte Sethna said that two states have granted licences and two other states have granted it provisional licenses. The petitioner during the earlier hearings has argued that there is discrimination against it as Uber etc. continue to offer the same service of bike taxis but are protected by status quo order. The court today pointed out that there is a flaw in the petitioner’s case as it is continuing to operate its services despite not having licence. The court has kept all the contentions open for further consideration and posted the matter for January 20, 2023. The state in a notification dated December 29, 2022, said that there is no scheme for bike taxis and no fare structure policy in place. Being unconvinced by the state’s reasons to refuse bike taxi licenses, the court in an earlier order had said “Nobody seems to have applied their mind to the evident advantages from various perspectives including reducing traffic congestion, pollution reduction and efficiency in transport by allowing bike rider systems. We expect that these will be made subject to certain safety requirements that must be followed but that is hardly a reason for rejecting the entire proposal in this fashion.” Case no. – WP/15991/2022 [Civil]  Case Title – Roppen Transportation Services Pvt.

"No fault can be attached to the Hospital if the operation theatres were occupied when the patient was taken for surgery. Operation theatres cannot be presumed to be available at all times"The Supreme Court, on Tuesday held that non-availability of an emergency operation theatre during the period when surgeries were being performed on other patients is not a valid ground to hold the hospital negligent in any manner.

The Supreme Court, on Tuesday held that non-availability of an emergency operation theatre during the period when surgeries were being performed on other patients is not a valid ground to hold the hospital negligent in any manner.  A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian observed that if a patient who was admitted in a critical condition does not survive even after surgery, the blame cannot be passed on to the Hospital or the Doctor who provided all possible treatment within their means and capacity.  "The experts in the other fields have been consulted from time to time and the treatment was modulated accordingly. In spite of the treatment, if the patient had not survived, the doctors cannot be blamed as even the doctors with the best of their abilities cannot prevent the inevitable."  The matter emanates from a 2010 order of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) against the Bombay Hospital and Medical Research Centre and one of its doctors, wherein it had directed them to pay the deceased Rs. 14,18,491 along with interest for medical negligence and deficiency in services.   The complaints alleged that the doctor did not examine the patient after survey, delayed his DSA test, his angiography and later his treatment due to non availability of operation theatre. They further contended that the patient was left in the care of inexperienced doctors who did not properly treat the gangrene on his legs.  The Hospital pointed out the two factors that were held against the doctor by the NCDRC:  He did visit the patient soon after surgery to verify the blood flow;He did not visit the patient when he was in Mumbai (29.04.1988 - 9.5.1988) and he went abroad for attending medical conference (9.5.1988 - 7.6.1998)  The Court found that negligence cannot be affixed on the doctor and hospital for delay in DSA test due to non-working of the DSA machine, which was beyond human control. It observed that the doctors were on their feet, which is evident from the fact that soon they adopted the alternative process to determine blood flow by means of angiography.  "No fault can be attached to the Hospital if the operation theatres were occupied when the patient was taken for surgery. Operation theatres cannot be presumed to be available at all times. Therefore, non-availability of an emergency operation theatre during the period when surgeries were being performed on other patients is not a valid ground to hold the Hospital negligent in any manner."  The Court stated that there was no proof to show negligence in performing surgery. Adding that it held that the mere fact that the the doctor went aboard does not in any manner prove negligence.  "Mere fact that the Doctor had gone abroad cannot lead to an inference of medical negligence as the patient was admitted in a hospital having specialists in multi-faculties. Two doctors from the unit of the Doctor namely Dr. Bindra and Dr. Partha, both post graduates, were present to attend to the patient." In today's world of specialisation the argument that the doctor who had conducted the surgery had to be responsible  for other aspects of the treatment did not impress the Court.  "It is a case where the patient was in serious condition impending gangrene even before admission to the Hospital but even after surgery and re-exploration, if the patient does not survive, the fault cannot be fastened on the doctors as a case of medical negligence."  The Court observed -   "It is too much to expect from a doctor to remain on the bed side of the patient throughout his stay in the hospital which was being expected by the complainant here. A doctor is expected to provide reasonable care which is not proved to be lacking in any manner in the present case."  Placing reliance on a catena of judgment the Court noted that the NCDRC had passed the impugned order solely on the principle of res ipsa loquitor, which is based on evidence. The Court found that there was no evidence on record to suggest the same.   A sum of Rs. 5 lakh that was already disbursement by the interim order of the Supreme Court was directed to be treated as an ex gratia payment to the complainant, not recoverable by the Hospital or the doctor.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday, while hearing an application filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ('Arbitration Act') for appointment of an arbitrator to resolve the dispute between the parties, held that the bars for instituting a suit or any other proceeding under Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 ('Partnership Act') shall not... The Calcutta High Court on Friday, while hearing an application filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ('Arbitration Act') for appointment of an arbitrator to resolve the dispute between the parties, held that the bars for instituting a suit or any other proceeding under Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 ('Partnership Act') shall not be applicable to arbitral proceedings under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act.  The case of the applicants was that, although unregistered, a partnership deed was executed between the applicants and the respondents containing an Arbitration Clause mandating the referral of all disputes and questions to a person appointed unanimously to act as an arbitrator.   A dispute arose between the parties, subsequent to which, the applicants sent a notice to the respondents invoking the arbitration clause and proposing the name of an advocate as sole arbitrator to resolve the dispute. In their reply, however, respondents denied the appointment of an arbitrator alleging that the allegations raised by the applicants in their initial notice were false. Aggrieved in these circumstances, the applicants filed the application under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act for appointment of an arbitrator.  In the present application filed by the applicants, the respondents argued that since the partnership firm was 'unregistered,' the dispute could not be referred to an arbitrator in view of the application of and the bar created by Section 69 of the Partnership Act. Their case was that since sub-sections (1) and (2) read with sub-section (3) of Section 69 of the Partnership Act restrict the filing of suit by any person as a partner of an unregistered firm including by means of a claim under 'other proceedings,' the applicants could not seek appointment of an arbitrator, the partnership deed in their case being 'unregistered.'   Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava relied on the Supreme Court decision in Umesh Goel v. Himachal Pradesh Cooperative Group Housing Society Limited, (2016) 11 SCC 313 and on the Madras High Court decision in M/s. Jayamurugan Granite Exports v. M/s. SQNY Granites, 2015 4 LW 385, both of which held that arbitral proceedings shall not come under the expression 'other proceedings' of Section 69(3) of the Partnership Act and that the ban imposed under Section 69 can have no application to arbitration proceedings as well as an arbitral award under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act.   Accordingly, the Calcutta High Court held that non-registration of the partnership firm would not attract the bar under Section 69 of the Partnership Act, so far as institution of proceedings under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act is concerned.

The right to be represented by a counsel or agent of one's choice in a disciplinary proceedings is not an absolute right, the Supreme Court observed. The court said that such right to be legally represented depends on how the rules govern such representation.However, if the charge is of severe and complex nature, then the request to be represented through a counsel or agent should be considered, the bench comprising observed(Case :The Chairman, State Bank of India and another versus MJ James). In this case, the disciplinary proceedings was initiated against a bank manager of the Quilon branch of the Bank of Cochin, on the charges that he had committed grave misconduct by sanctioning advances in violation of the Head Office instructions causing financial loss to the bank. His request seeking permission to engage services of one Mr. F.B. Chrysostom (Syndicate Bank, Mattancherry, Cochin), the Organising Secretary of the All-India Confederation of Bank Officers Organisation, Kerala State Unit, to defend him was denied. It was held that, in terms of the Service Code, a charge-sheeted officer cannot be defended by an office-bearer of any association or a union except an office-bearer of an association or a union of the employees of the bank, that is, the Bank of Cochin Ltd. The Disciplinary proceedings continued against him and it found that all charges against him was proved. By an order dated 18.04.1985, the Chairman of the Bank of Cochin dismissed him from service. By the order dated 23.01.1999, the appeal was rejected by the Chief General Manager.  Later, the High Court allowed his writ petition challenging these proceedings primarily on the ground that the inquiry officer had wrongly rejected his request to be defended/represented by the organizing secretary of the All-India Confederation of Bank Organizations, Kerala Unit. This amounted to a denial of reasonable opportunity, notwithstanding the respondent's participation in the inquiry, it was held.  Relevant Service Code provisions permitted the delinquent 'to be defended by a representative of a registered Union/Association of bank employees or with the Bank's permission, by a lawyer. Interpreting the clause, the Division Bench of the High court observed that the article "the" was missing before the bank employees in the said clause, which indicates that the union/association referred to therein was not only regarding employees of the bank itself, namely 'the Bank of Cochin', and would, therefore, include employees' union/association of other banks also. In appeal, the Apex Court bench disagreed with this reasoning of the High Court.  "The reasoning solely predicated on non-existence of article 'the' before 'bank' in Clause 22(ix)(a) of the Service Code does not justify inference of repugnancy in the context of the subject matter, including the intent behind Clause 22(ix)(a) of the Service Code.", the court said. Referring to the decisions in Crescent Dyes and Chemicals Ltd. v. Ram Naresh Tripathi and National Seeds Corporation Ltd. v. K.V. Rama Reddy, the court observed: The right to be represented by a third person in domestic inquiries/tribunals is based upon the precept that it is not desirable to restrict right of representation by a counsel or agent of one's choice. The ratio does not tantamount to acceptance of the proposition that such a right is an element of principles of natural justice, and its denial would immediately invalidate the inquiry. Representations are often restricted by a law, such as under Section 36 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as also by certified Standing Orders. The aforementioned two decisions ascribe to catena of decisions, including English case law on this subject, which accept that the right to be legally represented depends on how the rules govern such representation. Further, if the rules are silent, the party has no absolute right to be legally represented. However, the entitlement of a fair hearing is not to be dispensed with. What fairness requires would depend upon the nature of the investigation and the consequences it may have on the persons affected by it. Thus, the right to be represented by a counsel or agent of one's choice is not an absolute right but one which can be controlled, restricted, or regulated by law, rules, or regulations. However, if the charge is of severe and complex nature, then the request to be represented through a counsel or agent should be considered. The above proposition flows from the entitlement of fair hearing, which is applicable in judicial as well as quasi-judicial decisions. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the High Court judgment.  "We uphold the order of dismissal and consequently the writ petition filed by the respondent would be treated as dismissed", the Court said in conclusion.

Emphasizing on the need to revise the pay structure for the judicial officers, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered for implementation of the enhanced pay scale as recommended by the Second National Judicial Pay Commission with effect from January 1, 2016.  The bench of Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justices Krishna Murari and Hima Kohli also directed the Center and the States to pay the arrears to the officers in 3 instalments - 25% in 3 months, another 25% in next 3 months and balance by June 30, 2023.  The Top Court also observed that it was imperative for revision of pay structure immediately since judicial officers were not covered by the Pay Commission constituted by the State and centre.  "As a matter of fact, scales of pay of government servants are raised in some states once in 5 years and once in 10 years in central govt. Judicial officers are not covered by pay commission constituted by state and centre. Therefore there's an imperative need to revise pay structure immediately," the bench said in its order.  The directions were issued by the Top Court while considering a plea by All India Judges Association for constitution of All India Judicial Commission to review the service conditions of the judges of the district judiciary. On January 6, 2022 the Court had said that the two issues which were pending for consideration related to Pay Scales to the subordinate Judiciary and the other relating to pensionary/retiral benefits. The Second National Judicial Pay Commission was constituted by the Apex Court in 2017 for reviewing the pay scale and other conditions of Judicial Officers belonging to the subordinate judiciary all over the country. The Bench comprising Justices J Chelameswar and Abdul Nazeer had appointed former Supreme Court Judge Justice PV Reddy as commission Chairman and former Kerala High Court Judge and Senior Supreme Court lawyer R.Basant as member. Court room exchange In the hearing today, amicus curiae and Advocate K Parameshwar submitted that as per the recommendations of the Second National Judicial Pay Commission,the judges were entitled to a revised pay scale. He further termed the refusal of states to pay the revised pay to the officers on the ground of lack of funds as "unjust". He also added that earlier the Top Court had appointed a committee headed by Justice E Padhmanabhan for determining the pay scales of all the Judicial Officers working and retired throughout the country which had recommended the revision.  "This objection of all the states that they don't have money to pay to the judicial officers is unjust," the counsel further submitted while arguing that the Court had granted an interim relief by directing to pay the extent of 30% of increase in basic pay with accrued increments to all categories/ranks of Judicial Officers.  Considering amicus submissions, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, expressed his inclination for implementation of the revised pay scale since 2016.  "We're not going to wait endlessly and it's 6.5 years of delay. Since 2016 they're waiting. As far as pay scale is concerned, we are implementing" the CJI remarked. The order dictated by the bench stated as follows : "We are of the view that the revision of pay structure indicated in Table 1 shall be accepted....The same shall be implemented with effect from 01.01.2016. Judicial officers have been provided interim relief of 30%. Therefore, the arrears shall be computed by adjusting the interim relief and the balance of 25% be paid in cash within a period of 3 months and another within a period of another 3 months, balance 50% to be paid in the first quarter of 2023" All India Judges' Association the Petitioner in the matter was led by Senior Advocate Gourab Banerji, Ms. Mayuri Raghuvanshi, Advocate-on-record, Vyom Raghuvanshi, and Purvat Wali, Advocates  Case Title: All India Judges Association vs Union of India & Ors Subordinate judiciary - Supreme Court directs pay hike for subordinate judiciary as per the recommendations of the Second National Judicial Pay Commission w.e.f January 1, 2016-                 
On Wednesday, the Bombay High Court authoritatively ruled that a daughter could present a petition challenging the validity of her parent(s)' second marriage.

It... On Wednesday, the Bombay High Court authoritatively ruled that a daughter could present a petition challenging the validity of her parent(s)' second marriage.  A Division Bench of Justices VG Bisht and RD Dhanuka interpreted clause (b) of the Explanation appended to Section 7 to hold that a daughter has every locus to bring in question the validity of her father's marriage.  It was stated,  "Having regard to the Objects and Reasons of the Act vis-a-vis literal construction of Clause (b) under Explanation, in our considered view, the appellant has every locus to bring in question the validity of marriage of her father with the respondent and as also respondent's status."  The Bench pronounced judgment in an appeal against a Family Court's dismissal of a woman's petition (appellant) against her father's second wife. The appellant filed a petition questioning the validity of the respondent's marriage to the appellant's father. Her father, a wealthy industrialist, married the respondent after the death of the appellant's mother.  The Family Court had rejected the petition stating that the appellant had filed suits against the respondent before the High Court at earlier instances. Applying Rule 2, Order II of the Civil Procedure Code, the Family Court opined that the appellant had relinquished her right to claim the relief of nullity of marriage as against the respondent when she filed her suits in the High Court. Therefore, she could not claim the relief before the Family Court, it was ruled.  Order II of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 "Suit to include the whole claim"Rule 2: Relinquishment of part of claim- Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of, or internationally relinquishes, any portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished.  The appellant averred that the respondent married her father claiming to have divorced her first husband while in fact the divorce documents were doubtful.  She additionally contended that the respondent took undue advantage of her father's mental ailments, infirmities and unsoundness of mind, married him, and then unduly influenced him with the motive of siphoning his properties. Her father passed away in 2015, the Court was informed.  Opposing the petition as well as the grounds of appeal, the respondent asserted that the appellant did not possess the required legal standing (locus standi) to assail her father's marriage. To buttress this submission, her counsel propounded that the Family Courts Act allowed only parties to a marriage to assail the validity of marriage.  After an analysis of Section 7 of the legislation and its attendant explanation clauses, the Court took specific notice to clause b.  Whereas Clause (a) expressly specified the Family Court's jurisdiction to encompass suits between parties to a marriage in respect of nullity of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights etc, Clause (b) made no such stipulation.  The explanation, along with clauses (a) and (b), reads as below:  Explanation: The suits and proceedings referred to in this sub-section are suits and proceedings of the following nature, namely:— (a) a suit or proceeding between the parties to a marriage for a decree of nullity of marriage (declaring the marriage to be null and void or, as the case may be, annulling the marriage) or restitution of conjugal rights or judicial separation or dissolution of marriage; (b) a suit or proceeding for a declaration as to the validity of a marriage or as to the matrimonial status of any person;  In this context, the Court remarked,  "To note that Clause (b) is widely couched to encompass in its ambit and include the proceeding of the nature referred to regarding declaration of the validity of the marriage or it could be for a declaration of the matrimonial status of any person, would be a but fair comment."  After a discussion of the Statute's Objects and Reasons, the Court declared that as per a literal construction of Clause(b) the appellant possessed the necessary locus to move the petition.  As to the question of jurisdiction, the Court found that the Family Court had erred in applying Order II, Rule 2 to the case at hand.   Referring to the statute, the Court asserted that a Family Court was intended to possess exclusive jurisdiction of matters connected to matrimonial relief. Stating that Section 8 of the Family Courts Act denuded the High Court of its authority to grant reliefs relating to marriage etc, the Court opined that the question of Order II, Rule 2's applicability did not arise even remotely. This was especially as the previous suits were filed before the appellant discovered the alleged irregularities in the respondent's divorce documents  The Court said,  "In our view, since in view of Explanation (b) to Section 7(1) of the Act, the reliefs sought in the proceedings filed before the Family Court could not have been granted by the Civil Court in the suits filed by the appellant, question of applicability of Order 2 Rule 2 did not arise even remotely."  With these observations, among others, the Court remanded the matter back to the Family Court for a fresh decision on the validity of marriage. Expressing that the matter was to be decided expeditiously, preferably within six months, the appeal was allowed.

The Supreme Court reiterated that, at Section 482 CrPC stage, a High Court is not required to appreciate the evidence to find out whether the accused is likely to be convicted or not. In this case, the High Court had quashed a murder case against one of the accused. The wife of the deceased thus approached the Apex Court contending that there is ample material against the accused. According to the complaint, one of the accused (not the appellant) had offered the couple a 'Prasadam' from Shirdi Sai Baba Temple. Since the powder was bitter in taste, the wife spitted it out, however, her husband had consumed it; that her husband fainted and fell down and ultimately died. The accused along with the appellant were charged under Sections 326, 307, 302, 420, r/w 34 IPC. Before the Apex Court, it was contended that that the allegations of giving poison and even purchasing of poison is against the main accused only; that there is no evidence that at the time when the main-accused gave poison to the deceased, the appellant was present there. While allowing the appeal, the bench referred to the observation made in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Deepak, (2019) 13 SCC 62: "it is observed and held that at the stage of framing of charges, the Court has to consider the material only with a view to find out if there is a ground for "presuming" that the accused had committed the offence. It is observed and held that at that stage, the High Court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom, take at their face value, disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence or offences. It is further observed and held that at this stage the High Court is not required to appreciate the evidence on record and consider the allegations on merits and to find out on the basis of the evidence recorded the accused chargesheeted or against whom the charge is framed is likely to be convicted or not." The court observed that quashing the chargesheet against the accused is not justified and that the court ignored what has emerged during the course of investigation. "The High Court has entered into the appreciation of the evidence and considered whether on the basis of the evidence, the accused is likely to be convicted or not, which as such is not permissible at all at this stage while considering the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The High Court was not as such conducting the trial and/or was not exercising the jurisdiction as an appellate court against the order of conviction or acquittal. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court ought not to have quashed the chargesheet qua respondent no.1 herein – original accused no.2.", the court added.         
The Delhi High Court has dismissed a public interest litigation which had sought setting up of a regulatory authority or censor board to review and censor the non-film songs and their contents including their lyrics and videos, before their release on internet. The petition had sought immediate ban on all non-film songs with "obscene/vulgar" content.  A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that there is a clear regulation or regime laid down by the Central Government to regulate the information or content which is available to the general public through various media platforms. “As far as television is concerned, the Cinematograph Act, 1952, and the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, addresses the issue regarding regulation of content which is being telecasted on these platforms,” the court said.  The court said directing appointment of a regulatory authority would result in legislation by the court which is not permissible.  It said that courts cannot mandate a statute or add provisions to a statute as it would amount to legislation “which is not permissible in the constitutional scheme of this country.” “The role of judiciary is primarily only to test the legality of a statute and not to amend/modify a statute. Setting up of tribunals, authorities, regulators come purely within the domain of legislature and not in the domain of Courts,” the bench said. Online Platforms The court noted that the Union of India has brought out the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 laying down a regimen to be followed by every intermediary. "Rule 3 & 4 of the Ethics Code applies to various intermediaries like Youtube, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, etc.,. These guidelines regulate the nature of content that should not be hosted by these platforms. These guidelines read with the IT Act also provides for offences in case of violation of the Ethics Code. In addition to offences under the IT Act, the violators can also be booked under the Indian Penal Code. Thus, the grievance of the Petitioner that there is no Regulatory Authority/censor board to censor/review the non-film songs, their lyrics and videos which are made available to the general public through various media platforms like Television, YouTube, etc. has been taken care of by the Ethics Code and the regime framed thereunder," it said. The court further noted that Section 7 of the Ethics Code states that whenever an intermediary fails to observe these rules, the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 79 of the Act shall not be applicable to such intermediary and the intermediary shall be liable for punishment under any law for the time being in force including the provisions of the Act and the Indian Penal Code.  "Part III of the Ethics Code applies to publishers of news and current affairs content and publishers of online curated content and other intermediaries which disseminate information on various social media/digital media platforms. This is apart from the guidelines under Rule 3 & 4 of the Ethics Code and is applicable to digital media platforms and OTT platforms. The Government of India has ensured that these platforms, despite not being intermediaries, are also regulated and do not upload content that violates the below-mentioned rules and regulations," it noted. The court said there there is a clear regulation/regime that has been laid down by the Central Government to regulate the content which is available to the general public through various media platforms and thus contention that that there is no regulatory authority is incorrect Title: NEHA KAPOOR & ANR v.

The Supreme Court observed that a dependent/applicant cannot seek compassionate appointment on the higher post than what was held by the deceased employee.The Court observed that the appointment on compassionate ground is a concession and not a right.

The Supreme Court  observed that a dependent/applicant cannot seek compassionate appointment on the higher post than what was held by the deceased employee. The Court observed that the appointment on compassionate ground is a concession and not a right. It is an exception to the general rule of appointment in the public services and is in favour of the dependents of a deceased dying in harness and leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood, the bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed. In this case, the deceased employee at the time of his death was posted and serving as Messenger in Police Radio Department of Uttar Pradesh (Class­ IV). The Single Bench of the High Court dismissed the  writ petition filed by the widow of the deceased employee on the ground that as the deceased employee was Class­ IV employee and she has also been offered appointment on a Class ­IV post, she cannot claim the appointment on compassionate ground on the post of Workshop Hand or on any other suitable Class­ III post. In appeal, the Division bench allowed her writ petition observing that  appointment under Rule 5 of Dying­ In ­Harness Rules 1974 is required to be given on a "suitable post" and the term 'suitable' in Rule 5 pertains to suitability of the person who desires for appointment and it has nothing to do with the post held by the deceased government servant. In appeal before the Apex Court, the Government contended that 'suitable post' mentioned in Rule 5 of Rules 1974 has to be construed considering the educational qualification of dependent vis­à­vis the post held by the deceased employee.  Agreeing with the said argument, the court observed that the 'Suitable post' has to be considered, considering status/post held by the deceased employee and the educational qualification/eligibility criteria is required to be considered, considering the post held by the deceased employee and the suitability of the post is required to be considered vis a vis the post held by the deceased employee.  "10.2.......Otherwise there shall be no difference/distinction between the appointment on compassionate ground and the regular appointment. In a given case it may happen that the dependent of the deceased employee who has applied for appointment on compassionate ground is having the educational qualification of Class­II or Class­I post and the deceased employee was working on the post of Class/Grade IV and/or lower than the post applied, in that case the dependent/applicant cannot seek the appointment on compassionate ground on the higher post than what was held by the deceased employee as a matter of right, on the ground that he/she is eligible fulfilling the eligibility criteria of such higher post. The aforesaid shall be contrary to the object and purpose of grant of appointment on compassionate ground which as observed hereinabove is to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis on the death of the bread earner.", the court said while allowing the appeal. The court made the following observations in the judgment: The compassionate ground is a concession and not a right. Referring to a recent judgment in Director of Treasuries in Karnataka vs. V. Somashree, the court observed:  9. As per the law laid down by this court in catena of decisions on the appointment on compassionate ground, for all the government vacancies equal opportunity should be provided to all aspirants as mandated under Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution. However, appointment on compassionate  ground offered to a dependent of a deceased employee is an exception to the said norms. The compassionate ground is a concession and not a right. The whole object of granting compassionate employment is thus to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis. Referring to State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Shashi Kumar reported in (2019) 3 SCC 653, Govind Prakash Verma vs. LIC reported in (2005) 10 SCC 289, the bench observed: 10. Thus as per the law laid down by this court in the aforesaid decisions, compassionate appointment is an exception to the 16 general rule of appointment in the public services and is in favour of the dependents of a deceased dying in harness and leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood, and in such cases, out of pure humanitarian consideration taking into consideration the fact that unless some source of livelihood is provided, the family would not be able to make both ends meet, a provision is made in the rules to provide gainful employment to one of the dependants of the deceased who may be eligible for such employment. The whole object of granting compassionate employment is thus to enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis. The object is not to give such family a post much less a post held by the deceased.

In a writ petition assailing an order declining higher pay scale to the petitioner, the Calcutta High Court held that salary increment cannot be claimed when duties are performed without proper compliance of the relevant mandatory statutory provisions.

In a writ petition assailing an order declining higher pay scale to the petitioner, the Calcutta High Court held that salary increment cannot be claimed when duties are performed without proper compliance of the relevant mandatory statutory provisions.  The petitioner was appointed and had been working as an Assistant Teacher and had qualified Masters of Commerce ( M.Com) and Semister Examination 1990. The petitioner was appointed as a Work Education Teacher for classes V to X. On account of the paucity of teachers, at the request of the relevant school authority, the petitioner used to take commerce classes for classes XI and XII. Petitioner's request for a higher pay scale was rejected by the third respondent by a decision dated July 8, 2016, which was impugned in the present case.  The counsel for the petitioner stated that the service condition of the petitioner was governed under the West Bengal Services (Revision of Pay and Allowance) Rules, 1990 (ROPA). He argued that the petitioner deserved higher pay scale under the Career Advancement Scheme under Rule 16 of the ROPA, as he had acquired a higher qualification, though not in the subject for which he was appointed as an Assistant Teacher.  He argued that a circular containing administrative instruction issued by the Department of School Education in 1995. The circular provides that, an Assistant Teacher, who was appointed for a particular subject, if possessed a higher and proper qualification on any other different subject, subject to the compliance with the formalities, as mentioned in the said 1995 Circular, the teacher would be allowed and eligible to take classes in the higher section, on such subject in which he had acquired the higher qualification other than the subject for which he was appointed.  He argued that similarly placed candidates had received a higher pay scale and by refusing to grant such higher pay scale to the petitioner, Article 14 of the Constitution of India and the principle of equal pay for equal work were violated.  The petitioner stated that his class routine had received the seal of the District Inspector of School and was within his knowledge.   The counsel for the respondent argued that since the petitioner was appointed as an Assistant Teacher in a subject different from that of his higher education, he was not eligible to get such higher pay scale.  He argued that the 1995 Circular specifically provided for a prior permission which was necessary to be obtained from the concerned District Inspector of Schools. For the petitioner, no such prior permission was obtained by the school, and hence, the 1995 Circular did not apply to the petitioner.  The Court noted that all the teachers of secondary schools who had improved or would improve their qualifications or who were appointed with higher qualification in the subject or group relevant to their teaching/appointment should get higher scale of pay, apropos to their qualifications. The petitioner was appointed as an Assistant Teacher in the subject of Physical Education, in which he had the qualification of B.P.Ed. He had qualified Masters of Commerce (M.Com) which was a higher qualification but in a different subject. Since his original appointment was for the subject Physical Education he cannot claim a higher pay scale, the Court held.  The Court also noted that, as per the 1995 Circular, for allotment of classes of a higher section to an Assistant Teacher for a subject where he possesses a higher qualification than the subject for which his appointment was made as Assistant Teacher, a prior permission of the concerned District Inspector was a mandatory pre-requisite. From the records it did not appear to the Court that the relevant school had asked for any such prior permission for allotment of classes to the petitioner in the higher section in commerce subject.  The petitioner argued that the class routine permitting the petitioner to take Commerce classes in the higher section was within the knowledge of the concerned District Inspector of Schools as it contained the seal of the same. However, the Court held that the seal and signature of the District Inspector of Schools is not acceptable as "prior permission". The expression "prior permission", as used in the said 1995 Circular, must be read in the light of the entire circular as a whole, coupled with the relevant provisions under ROPA. The District Inspector of Schools, while giving his prior permission, must do so with an application of mind.   The Court declared that this was not a case of Article 14, as the case was of non-compliance of the relevant mandatory statutory provisions, which were crucial for the case of the petitioner.   Finding that the impugned order did not suffer from any infirmity, wither procedural or legal, the Court dismissed the petition.  Case Title: DILIP KUMAR GHOSH VS. STATE OF WEST BENGAL AND ORS.         
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that merely because a number of FIRs stand registered against a person he cannot be denied concession of bail, particularly, when his involvement in commission of a non-bailable offence is not prima facie shown from the contents of the FIR.  The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing an application moved by the petitioner/accused, whereby he had sought bail in a case arising out of FIR for offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 379, 504, 506 IPC registered with Police Station, Gangyal, Jammu.  In his plea, the Petitioner contended that he has not committed any offence and that the dispute between the petitioner and the complainant is purely of civil nature relating to demarcation of the land.  Contesting his plea, the Respondents contended that the petitioner is a habitual offender, inasmuch as, 22 FIRs stand registered against him. Respondents further argued that the petitioner has been booked under the Public Safety Act and has been kept in preventive detention because of his criminal background. It was also averred that the investigation in the matter is still in progress and, as such, the concession of bail cannot be given to the petitioner at this stage.  Deciding the contentions raised by the parties, Justice Dhar observed that the overriding considerations in granting bail as laid down in Section 437 (1) and Section 439(1) of Cr.P.C, are the nature and gravity of the offence, the frivolity or otherwise of the prosecution case, the position and status of the accused with reference to the victim and the witnesses, the likelihood of accused fleeing from justice, the chances of repeating of offence by the accused, the chances of tampering with the witnesses, the stage of investigation and the public interest.  Deliberating further on the matter, the bench observed that while nature of offence and severity of punishment is an important consideration while considering the bail plea of an accused, a prima facie view of involvement of the accused in the alleged crime is a factor which is also required to be considered.  "It would be premature for this Court to deeply analyze the allegations made in the FIR lest it may prejudice the case of the prosecution. However, there appears prima facie merit in the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the dispute between the petitioner and the complainant appears to be essentially relating to demarcation of the land or at best a case of criminal trespass", the bench noted.  Dealing with the contention of the respondents that the petitioner is a history-sheeter, inasmuch as 22 FIRs stand registered against him and, as such, he does not deserve the concession of bail, the bench observed that it is true that the petitioner has been involved in a number of FIRs but he has placed on record copies of the orders passed by the Courts in at least six cases in which the petitioner has not even been put to trial but has been discharged at the stage of framing of charges itself, which supports the contention of Counsel for the petitioner that most of these cases are vexatious in nature.  The respondent has not placed on record anything to show that the petitioner has been convicted in any of these FIRs and therefore, merely because a number of FIRs stand registered against the petitioner, he cannot be denied concession of bail, the court added.  For the foregoing reasons, the bench allowed the petition and admitted the petitioner to bail on conditions.  Case Title : Ravinder Gupta Vs UT of J&K

Expressing concerns about the illegal adoption of children orphaned by COVID-19, the Supreme Court has directed State Governments and Union Territories to act against NGOs which are indulging in illegal adoption. "No adoption of affected children should be permitted contrary to the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015.Invitation to persons for adoption of orphans is contrary to law as no adoption of a child can be permitted without the involvement of CARA. Stringent action shall be taken by the State Governments/Union Territories against agencies/individuals who are responsible for indulging in this illegal activity", the Court ordered. "The State Governments/Union Territories are directed to prevent any NGO from collecting funds in the names of the affected children by disclosing their identity and inviting interested persons to adopt them", the bench added. The order was passed by a bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose in the suo moto case initiated by the court to deal with the problems of children affected by COVID (In Re Contagion of COVID Virus In Children Protection Homes). Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the National Council for the Protection of Child Rights, submitted before the court that certain unscrupulous organizations and individuals are indulging in illegal adoptions and are publishing public advertisements seeking funds.  Advocate Shobha Gupta filed an application in the suo moto case on behalf of an organization 'We the Women of India' bringing to the Court's notice public advertisements and social media posts inviting people to adopt orphans. She submitted that most of them are fake and in any event no adoption is permissible without involvement of Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). She stressed the need for immediate action to be taken by the State Governments and Union Territories to stop the circulation of such posts in the social media and stringent action should be taken against those who are responsible for such posts. Relying upon Section 108 of the JJ Act, 2015,Ms. Shobha Gupta submitted that wide publicity should be given to the schemes in operation which would favour the affected children.  "We share the concern of the learned Additional Solicitor General and Ms. Shobha Gupta about the illegal adoption of affected children", the bench observed. Over 30,000 children lost at least one parent The Supreme Court noted in the order that 30,071 children have become orphans or have lost one parent or abandoned due to COVID19 as per data collected by NCPCR till June 6 (3,621 orphans, 26,176 have lost one parent and 274 children have been abandoned). The Court had earlier directed the State Governments to upload the information of the children who lost parents in the pandemic since March 2020 in the national portal of NCPCR called "Bal Swaraj". Supreme Court notes that 30,071 children have become orphans or have lost one parent or abandoned due to COVID19 as per data collected by NCPCR till June 6 (3,621 orphans, 26,176 have lost one parent and 274 children have been abandoned).@NCPCR_— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) June 8, 2021  Give wide publicity to the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act and welfare schemes Noting that wide majority of the populace are not aware of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act 2015 and the welfare schemes announced under the Act, the Court directed the Union and State Governments to give wide publicity to the same. "Section 108 of the JJ Act, 2015 provides that the Central Government and the State Governments/Union Territories should take measures to ensure that the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015 are given wide publicity through media including Television, Radio and print media at regular intervals so as to make the general public, children and their parents or guardians aware of such provisions. It is true that the majority of the populace are not aware of their rights and entitlement to several benefits that are announced by the Governments.  The State Governments/Union Territories are directed to give wide publicity not only to the provisions of the JJAct, 2015 but also to the several schemes that have been announced by the Central Government and the State Governments/Union Territories benefiting the children who have become orphans and children in need of care and protection". The Court's directions are  :  The State Governments/Union Territories are directed to take action against those NGOs/individuals who are indulging in illegal adoptions.Wide publicity should be given to the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015 and the prevailing schemes of the Union of India and the State Governments/UnionTerritories which would benefit the affected children.

The Supreme Court held that to attract the bar of Section 69(2) of the Partnership Act, 1932, the contract in question must be the one entered into by partnership firm with the third-party defendant and must also be the one entered into by the plaintiff firm in the course of its business dealings.The bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath observed that Section 69(2) is not... The Supreme Court held that to attract the bar of Section 69(2) of the Partnership Act, 1932, the contract in question must be the one entered into by partnership firm with the third-party defendant and must also be the one entered into by the plaintiff firm in the course of its business dealings. The bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath observed that Section 69(2) is not a bar to a suit filed by an unregistered firm, if the same is for enforcement of a statutory right or a common law right. In this case, an unregistered partnership firm instituted the subject suit seeking perpetual injunction and declaration of a sale deed as null and void. An application was moved before the Trial Court by the contesting defendants under Order VII Rule 11(d), Order XXX Rules 1 and 2 and Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 read with Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 for rejection of plaint on the ground that the suit filed by and on behalf of an unregistered partnership firm was barred by law.  The Trial Court, dismissing the said application, essentially held that, on its subject-matter relating to the validity of the sale deed in question, the bar of Section 69(2) was not operating against this suit. The High Court held that the plaintiff, being an unregistered firm, would be barred to enforce a right arising out of the contract in terms of Section 69(2) of the Act of the Partnership Act. Before the Apex Court, the appellant- plaintiff contended that Section 69(2) of the Partnership Act does not bar all suits by an unregistered partnership firm against third parties. That, the suit is not hit by Section 69(2) because the contract is not in the regular business dealings of the firm; and the words "enforcing a right arising under the contract" used in Section 69(2) of the Act of 1932 signify the rights arising out of contracts in respect of the firm's business transactions only. The defendants-respondents contended that since the sale document was related to the business of the firm, the suit was hit by the bar under Section 69(2) of the Act of 1932. The court, in this regard, referred to Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. v. Ganesh Property: (1998) 7 SCC 184, Haldiram Bhujiawala and Anr. v. Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar and Anr: (2000) 3 SCC 250 , Purushottam and Anr. v. Shivraj Fine Art Litho Works  (2007) 2 G.L.H. 406 : (2007) 15 SCC 58] and noted thus: "We may take note of the principles vividly exposited in the case of Haldiram Bhujiawala (supra) that to attract the bar of Section 69(2) of the Act of 1932, the contract in question must be the one entered into by firm with the third-party defendant and must also be the one entered into by the plaintiff firm in the course of its business dealings; and that Section 69(2) of the Act of 1932 is not a bar to a suit filed by an unregistered firm, if the same is for enforcement of a statutory right or a common law right". The court noted the following principles laid down in Haldiram: The contract by the unregistered firm referred to in Section 69(2) must not only be one entered into by the firm with the third-party defendant but must also be one entered into by the plaintiff firm in the course of the business dealings of the plaintiff firm with such third-party defendant.The legislature, when it used the words "arising out of a contract" in Section 69(2), it is referring to a contract entered into in course of business transactions by the unregistered plaintiff firm with its defendant customers and the idea is to protect those in commerce who deal with such a partnership firm in business. Such third parties who deal with the partners ought to be enabled to know what the names of the partners of the firm are before they deal with them in business. Section 69(2) is not attracted to any and every contract referred to in the plaint as the source of title to an asset owned by the firm. The court then noted that the sale transaction in question is not arising out of the business of the appellant firm and that the subject suit is for enforcing a right of avoidance of a document on the ground of fraud and misrepresentation as also the statutory rights of seeking declaration and injunction.  Allowing the appeal, the court held: 20. To put it differently, the relevant principles, when applied to the facts of the present case, leave nothing to doubt that the transaction in question was not the one entered into by the plaintiff firm during the course of its business (i.e., of building construction); and it had been an independent transaction of sale, of the firm's share in the suit property, to the contesting defendants. The bar of Section 69(2) is not attracted in relation to the said sale transaction. Moreover, the subject suit cannot be said to be the one for enforcement of right arising from a contract; rather the subject suit is clearly the one where the plaintiff seeks common law remedies with the allegations of fraud and misrepresentation as also of the statutory rights of injunction and declaration in terms of the provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 as also the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (while alleging want of the sale consideration). Therefore, the bar of Section 69(2) of the Act of 1932 does not apply to the present case.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday observed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should be made more independent like the Election Commission of India and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.  Notably, the Court directed the Central Government to consider bringing a separate Act giving statutory status with more powers and jurisdiction to CBI at the earliest. It may be noted that the CBI is at present constituted as per an executive notification under the Delhi Special Police  Establishment Act. The Gauhati High Court, in 2013, had quashed the said notification and held the CBI's formation to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court stayed the High Court order, which is still continuing (Read more about this here). Taking into consideration that the public reposes enormous faith and trust in CBI, the premiere investigative agency, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi passed a slew of directions and observed that the instant order 'is an attempt to release the "Caged Parrot" (CBI). "Caged Parrot" is a term used by the Supreme Court to describe the CBI in 2013. "CBI is a caged parrot speaking his master's voice", a bench headed by the then CJI RM Lodha had observed then. CBI lacks manpower, resources : High Court The Madras High Court's directions came in a petition filed by Ramanathapuram District Pathikkapattor Sangam seeking CBI probe into a chit fund scam. However, the Bench declined to refer the case to the CBI. The Court opined at the outset that despite the frequent referral of cases to CBI for investigation, there is a recurrent practice of CBI being unable to conduct prompt investigation due to a lack of resources and manpower.  "When such is the trust and faith of the people, very sadly CBI is dragging its feet, whenever there is a demand for CBI enquiry on the ground that resources and man power available with CBI are very restricted and therefore, it cannot conduct investigations. This is the usual stereotype version/defence of the CBI before the Courts", the Court opined.  Further enumerating upon the immense credibility of the CBI, the Court remarked,  "An aura of reverence is attached to the name of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). There is always a clamour for CBI investigation." Whenever any sensitive, heinous crimes are committed and there is no proper investigation by the local police, there is a demand for CBI investigation and the said demand for CBI investigation is increasing day by day due to the credibility of the Central Bureau of Investigation. People revere CBI as a premier trust worthy agency, which could investigate the cases impartially and fairly and prosecute the case before the Court efficiently and properly"  The Court vide its earlier order dated December 8, 2020 had taken serious objections to the CBI's inability to investigate important offences due to a lack of resources and had accordingly proceeded to pose a series of queries regarding the manpower, infrastructure capabilities, funds allocated when it comes to the investigating agency.  Many CBI cases end in acquittal : High Court "Many cases which are investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation, even serious cases, have ended in acquittal. It badly reflects upon the investigation of CBI. Hence, time has come to look into problems faced by CBI. Investigation of CBI needs to be improved by adding experts and modern gadgets", the Court had opined with anguish in its earlier order.  On Tuesday, the Court directed the Central government to take a decision on the comprehensive proposal for cadre review and restructuring of CBI within a period of one month. This direction was issued in light of the submission made that a proposal dated September 9, 2020 for comprehensive cadre review and restructuring of CBI and for creation of 734 additional posts in different ranks is pending with the Central Government.  "When there is a huge pendency in CFSL, either the infrastructure of CFSL has to be augmented or another CFSL should be established. Therefore there shall be a direction to the Central Government to enhance the infrastructural facilities available with CFSL in Ghaziabad, Uttarpradesh or to establish CFSL, zone wise, so that there would not be any delay in getting the opinion of the experts. The Central Government should establish at least one CFSL in each zone viz., South, East, West within one year", the Court further directed.  Furthermore, it was observed that officials and staff should be independently recruited by the CBI and given proper training instead of depending upon the deputation from police forces and other forces. In this regard the CBI was instructed to send a comprehensive proposal to the Central Government for approval.  Opining on the urgent need to augment the independence of CBI for the sake of impartial, neutral and credible investigation of cases, the Court made a reference to the observations made by the Supreme Court in Vineet Narayanan v. Union of India wherein it was observed that the "CBI is a caged parrot speaking in its master's voice'. "The said observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is fortified by the statement made by the CBI Director before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Coal allocation case that a former Law Minister meddled with the statement of CBI filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court", the Court further noted. The Bench also opined that Constitutional Courts also refer various cases to CBI for investigation sometimes even without State's consent which indicates the immense faith that public institutions have in the agency. Accordingly, the following pertinent directions were issued in order to enhance the efficiency of the investigating agency. Directions issued: •	Government of India is directed to consider and take a decision for enactment of a separate Act giving statutory status with more powers and jurisdiction to CBI at the earliest.  •	CBI shall be made more independent like Election Commission of India and Comptroller and Auditor General of India.  •	Separate budgetary allocation shall be made for CBI.  •	Director of CBI shall be given powers as that of the Secretary to the Government and shall directly report to the Minister/Prime Minister without going through DoPT.  •	Central Government shall make CBI independent with functional autonomy without administrative control of the Government.  •	CFSL shall have more modern facilities and should be augmented on par with the facilities available to Federal Bureau of Investigation in United States of America and Scotland Yard in United Kingdom.  •	DoPT is directed to pass orders on the CBI restructuring letter dated 09.09.2020 after consulting with other departments if necessary, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.  •	CBI should file a well thought out Policy within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, for permanently recruiting (i) Cyber Forensic experts and (ii) Financial Audit experts, so that all the branches/wings of CBI should have these experts available with them and not on case to case basis.  •	DoPT should clear all the pending proposals pertaining to CBI's infrastructure development e.g. land construction, residential accommodation, upgradation of available technical gadgets etc., within a period of six weeks.  •	CFSL attached to CBI should clear all the pending cases as on 31.12.2020. Similarly, other FSLs should also offer their Forensic opinion pending as on 31.12.2020 within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.  •	The details of cases wherein charges have not been framed by the Trial Courts despite the charge sheets having been filed by CBI for more than one year, should be shared by Director, CBI with the respective Registrar Generals of the High Courts.  •	Since CBI itself has stated in reply to Para 'O' that CBI has to work within the constraints of shortage of manpower, Director, CBI should send another detailed proposal seeking further increase in the divisions/wings as well as strength of Officers in CBI to the Government of India within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and Government of India should pass orders on the same within a period of three months of its receipt.

In a significant judgment on the Consumer Protection Act 2019, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission(NCDRC) can direct the deposit of the entire amount or more than 50% of the amount determined by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for conditional stay.The Court added that however to pass such an order, the NCDRC has to pass... In a significant judgment on the Consumer Protection Act 2019, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission(NCDRC) can direct the deposit of the entire amount or more than 50% of the amount determined by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for conditional stay. The Court added that however to pass such an order, the NCDRC has to pass a speaking order assigning cogent reasons. The Court also held that the condition of pre-deposit for entertaining appeal under Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act 2019 was mandatory. A bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna laid down this dictum in a case involving the interpretation of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, which prescribes pre-deposit for filing appeal before the NCDRC. Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of order of the State Commission shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited 50% of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed. The question before the Court was whether the same can be said to be the minimum amount to be deposited or whether the NCDRC was precluded from directing the deposit of amount higher than 50% of the amount determined by the SCDRC. The question framed by the Court was:  "whether the National Commission can pass an order to deposit the entire amount and/or any amount higher than the 50% of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission while, entertaining the appeal in view of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019".  The bench has answered the issue in the following terms : (I) pre-deposit of 50 per cent of amount as ordered by the State Commission under second proviso to Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 is mandatory for entertainment of an appeal by the National Commission;  (ii) the object of the said pre-deposit condition is to avoid frivolous appeals;  (iii) the said pre-deposit condition has no nexus with the grant of stay by the National Commission;  (iv) while considering the stay application in staying the order passed by the State Commission, the National Commission can grant a conditional stay directing the appellant(s) to deposit the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission;  (v) however, at the same time, the National Commission has to assign some cogent reasons and/or pass a speaking order when the conditional stay of the order passed by the State Commission is passed subject to deposit of the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount either as an ex parte order or after hearing both sides and considering the facts and circumstances of the case.  (vi) Thus, the National Commission can grant a conditional stay of the order passed by the State Commission on deposit of the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount as ordered by the State Commission in the aforesaid manner. Background The appeals before the Supreme Court were filed by a group of builders aggrieved by the direction of the NCDRC to deposit the entire decretal amount determined by the SCDRC for conditional stay. Senior Advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for the appellants, essentially argued that Section 51 imposed a statutory limit that the pre-deposit amount cannot be higher than 50% of the decretal amount. The Supreme Court held that Section 51 does not take away the power of NCDRC to direct the deposit of the entire amount. "...it is a condition precedent to deposit  50% of the amount before his appeal is entertained by the National Commission. However, that does not take away the jurisdiction of the National Commission to order to deposit the entire amount and or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount while considering the stay application to stay the order passed by the State Commission", the judgment authored by Justice MR Shah noted. "Pre-deposit condition as per second proviso to Section 51 has no nexus with the grant of interim order of stay by the National Commission subject to deposit of the amount awarded by the State Commission", the judgment added. The Court also noted that the precedent Shreenath Corporation and Ors. Vs. Consumer Education and Research Society and Ors., (2014) 8 SCC 657, in the context of Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, had held that it is open to the NCDRC to impose any condition for stay of the impugned order. Since Section 19 of the 1986 Act is pari materia with Section 51 of the 2019 Act, the Court said that it was in agreement with the view expressed in Shreenath. "We are in complete agreement with the view taken by this Court in the case of Shreenath Corporation and Ors. (supra). Therefore, it is held that National Commission can pass an order to deposit the entire amount and/or any amount higher than 50 per cent of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission while staying the order passed by the State commission", the Court stated in the judgment.  Accordingly, the appeals against the NCDRC orders were dismissed.  Case Title : Manohar Infrastructure and Constructions Private Ltd versus Sanjeev Kumar Sharma and others  
The Allahabad High Court last week denied anticipatory bail to Former MP Bal Kumar Patel who happens to be the brother of Slain dacoit Dadua in connection with a cheating and fraud case.  The bench of Justice Samit Gopal also refused to quash the case against him registered under Sections 419, 420 and 406 of IPC by observing thus:  "…the prima facie allegations against the applicant, the law on the subject and the criminal antecedents of the applicant, this Court does not deem it proper to quash the proceedings in the 482 petitions as prayed for."  The case in brief  The allegations against Patel are that he cheated and committed fraud against one Ramakant Tripathi (first informant) and his 3 associates and duped him of Rs. 65 lakhs in the name of investing money in the sand business.   The first informant and his associates alleged that Patel did not return Rs. 65 lakhs and also stopped responding to their phone calls. It was also alleged that some unknown people came to the house of the first informant and gave a threat that he should forget the money given to Bal Kumar Patel otherwise it will not be good for him.   Finally, Tripathi filed an FIR against Patel pursuant to which the court took cognizance of the same. Challenging the same and seeking anticipatory bail, Patel moved to the High Court.  The State opposed the Section 482 petition and the anticipatory bail application and argued that the applicant is named in the FIR and there are allegations against him and there has been misrepresentation on behalf of the applicant and he was actively involved in the conversation due to which money was transferred in his account.   It was also argued that there was mens rea on his part and the applicant had not cooperated in the investigation as is apparent from the case diary and in the investigation, credible evidence has been found against him.   On the other hand, the Accused argued that the first information report has been lodged under a misconception and the deal between the first informant and his friends and relatives with the applicant and co-accused was a business transaction and there was no offer and assurance given by the applicant either to the first informant or his associates.   High Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that at the stage of quashing, only the material of the prosecution has to be seen and the court cannot delve into the correctness of the allegations or the defence of the accused and then proceed to examine the matter on its merit by weighing the evidence so produced.   Having heard the state, informant, and the accused, the Court noted that the allegations prima facie show active participation of the applicant along with the co-accused while dealing with the first informant and his associates. Therefore, the Court found no ground to quash the proceedings.   In so far as the anticipatory bail application was concerned, the Court concluded that the accused could not make out a case for pre-arrest bail by noting thus: "...looking to the facts and circumstances of the case cumulatively that the applicant was a public representative earlier, the fact that he was involved earlier in many criminal cases, the non-cooperation by him in the investigation by not making himself available at the call of the Investigating Officer, the recorded fact of transfer of money in his bank account, the allegation of the applicant misrepresenting the first informant right from the inception of the talks, the allegation of threat being extended to the first informant by the henchmen of the applicant, the evidence as collected after which the investigation being concluded by filing a charge-sheet against the applicant and co-accused and as such the case being prima facie proved."

The Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench, has held that the use of salutations and titles such as "Raja", "Nawab" and "Rajkumar" in constitutional courts, all other Courts, tribunals, public offices of the State etc. is prohibited in terms of Articles 14, 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India. The court ordered that the said restriction will also apply in the public domain as well... The Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench, has held that the use of salutations and titles such as "Raja", "Nawab" and "Rajkumar" in constitutional courts, all other Courts, tribunals, public offices of the State etc. is prohibited in terms of Articles 14, 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India. The court ordered that the said restriction will also apply in the public domain as well as public documents & public offices.  Justice Sameer Jain, ruled,  "In the light of above, this Court holds that in Constitutional Courts, all other Courts, Tribunals, public offices of the State etc., the use of salutation and titles is prohibited in terms of Articles 14 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India. The said restriction will also apply in the public domain as well as public documents & public offices." The Court took up the issue on noticing that a respondent in the cause-title of a petition was addressed as "Raja Laxman Singh".   The Court pursued Article 14, 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India and observed that any title awarded to the citizen of India by a Foreign State cannot be accepted nor used and no such title, other than the military or academic distinctions, can be conferred other than by the State.  The Court also observed that in terms of Article 363A, the heredity titles of nobility being in conflict with the principles of equality and contrary to Article 14 cannot be used as prefixes or suffixes. In this regard, the court also relied on the cases of Raghunathrao Ganpatrao Vs. Union of India: 1994 [(Suppl.)1 SCC 191] and Balaji Raghavan Vs. Union of India [AIR 1996 SC 770].  Further, the Court ordered the Registry to send copy of this order to the office of the Advocate General, Rajasthan;  Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India; Registrar General of the High Court Court as well as the Chief Secretary, Govt. of Rajasthan, Secretariat, Jaipur for necessary implementation, circulation and to issue necessary directions.  The Court noted that the prohibition of titles in the public domain, public offices, Constitutional Courts or in public was not objected to by the petitioners, respondents or any other person. The court pointed out that ASG has also not filed any objection to the order passed by this Court and against the provisions of Articles 14, 18 and 363A of the Constitution of India as well as use of the titles which are unconstitutional.  Moreover, the court directed the petitioners to file amended cause title at all respective places.  Mr. M.S. Singhvi, Advocate General appearing for the State contended that in the light of Articles 14, 18 and 363A as well as in Raghunathrao Ganpatrao, the constitutional validity of 26th Amendment has been upheld. He added that the State of Rajasthan do endorse the view that use of prefixes and suffixes, other than military or academic distinction in terms of Article 18, are abolished and are violative of Article 14. He also submitted that the same cannot be used in the public offices, constitutional courts or in public domains. He further submitted that the State has a respect for the contribution and the public welfare, philanthropy offered by the royal families in the past.  The counsel for the respondents Mr. Vagish Kr. Singh submitted that the Apex Court in Balaji Raghavan has upheld the validity of 26th Amendment and Article 363A of the Constitution of India and has imposed prohibition on the conferment of titles of nobility and the heredity titles of nobility as the same are in conflict with the principles of equality.  In the present matter, the Rajasthan High Court had earlier issued notice to the Central and State Governments asking as to whether any person can put Maharaja, Raja, Nawab, Rajkumar titles as a prefix while filing cases in the High Court or Trial Court.  On 11.01.2022, the Bench of Justice Sameer Jain had sought the reply of the Union and Rajasthan Government after perusing the cause title of a petition, wherein, the Court noted, the respondent No.1 in the matter was titled as "Raja Laxman Singh". Notably, when the counsel for the petitioner submitted that the said title was filed before the trial court and as a result of the same had to be repeated/ generated before the High Court, the court directed that limited notices be issued to the Additional Solicitor General and the Advocate General for the State to address the Court on the following issue:  " Whether after the insertion of Article 363-A and 26th Amendment in the Constitution of India, the said title of Raja,Nawab, Maharaja,Rajkumar as prefix can be filed/ addressed in the constitutional court or the learned trial court below"  Also Read: Can 'Raja/Nawab/Maharaja/Rajkumar' Titles Be Used As Prefix In Constitutional, Lower Courts?: Rajasthan HC Asks Centre, State  Adv. Suruchi Kasliwal appeared for the petitioners, while Adv. Vagish Kr. Singh, Adv. for Mr. Adv. Aashish Kr. Singh and Advocate General MS Singhvi appeared for the respondents.

Emphasizing that the rights to file a bail without delay and access to legal aid of an eligible prisoner are intertwined, the Allahabad High Court on Monday suggested some significant positive measures so as to overcome the delay in filing of bail pleas by undertrial prisoners in absence of proper legal aid."The right of moving a bail application becomes illusory and personal liberty remains... Emphasizing that the rights to file a bail without delay and access to legal aid of an eligible prisoner are intertwined, the Allahabad High Court on Monday suggested some significant positive measures so as to overcome the delay in filing of bail pleas by undertrial prisoners in absence of proper legal aid. "The right of moving a bail application becomes illusory and personal liberty remains a distant dream if the right to legal aid of an entitled prisoner is not effectuated," the Bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot observed as it directed the State Legal Services Authority to devise a scheme for such undertrial prisoners who are unable to filed bail pleas due to lack of proper access to legal aid. The Court suggested the measures as it took note of the issue being faced by the under-trial prisoners regarding their inability to access legal aid raising legal and constitutional issues, which directly affect the right of bail and the personal liberty of the applicant. In this regard, the Court suggested the following measures while directing the jail authorities as well as concerned State authorities to cooperate with the State Legal Services Authority and the District Legal Services Authority and ensure effective implementation of the schemes framed by the State Legal Services Authority: A. To create a comprehensive programme with SOPs for legal aid to prisoners accused of various crimes including heinous offences who have not filed bail applications before the High Court within a period of one year after rejection of bail by the trial court. The said period of one year is only suggestive. The said period has to be determined by the State Legal Services Authority.  B. To create a comprehensive programme with SOPs for giving legal aid to prisoners accused of committing various crimes including heinous offences who have not been able to move bail applications before the trial court six months after imprisonment. The said period of six months is only suggestive. The said period has to be determined by the State Legal Services Authority.  C. The State Legal Services Committee may suggest to the High Court to decide an appropriate procedure for filing of bail applications on behalf of the undertrial prisoners, and particularly those who do not have any pairokars.  D. Legal aid counsels may be given appropriate directions to take measures for listing and early hearing of bail applications.  E. Filing of subsequent bail applications in case the first bail application is rejected by the High Court.  F. The jail authorities and District Legal Services Authority shall maintain the list of all prisoners which shall contain these details. Date of imprisonment, date of filing of bail application before the competent court, date of grant/rejection of bail application by the trial court, the date of grant/rejection of bail application by the High Court, date of conviction, and latest status of pending bail applications. Efforts should be made to make updated order sheets of courts, and likely dates of listing available online in jails.  G. Regular intimation of the status of the case to the prisoners. Take regular feedback from prisoners including those who have been given legal aid. With this, the Court also stressed the importance of legal as it noted that legal aid is a catalyst to redeem the preamble promise of justice and remains a bulwark for the protection of fundamental rights. The Court also observed that the High Court is under a constitutional obligation to address various legal and constitutional issues which impact the grant of bail if they arise in the facts of a case. "The rights to file a bail without delay, and access to legal aid of an eligible prisoner are intertwined. They cannot be separated. The right of moving a bail application becomes illusory and personal liberty remains a distant dream if the right to legal aid of an entitled prisoner is not effectuated. A fresh breeze of fundamental rights shall blow through the stone walls that a prison makes. Iron bars of jails cannot hold back the glad tidings of equal justice," the Court further remarked. The Court also said that the fundamental rights of prisoners paired with statutory duties of the State Legal Services Authority cast an obligation on the SLSA to devise a scheme that shall take care of the following points: (I) to identify prisoners who are undertrials for various crimes including heinous offences and have not applied for bail before the trial court in a timely manner after their imprisonment (II) to identify prisoners who are facing trials for various crimes including heinous offences but have failed to file bail applications before the High Court in an expeditious time frame after rejection of their bail application by the trial court,  (III) to identify prisoners who are facing trials in various offences including heinous crimes but are unable to file subsequent bails before the High Court after the rejection of earlier bail applications by this Court,  (IV) to identify prisoners who are unable to effectively prosecute their pending bail applications in various offences including heinous crimes causing delays in hearing,  (V) to ascertain whether the inability of the said prisoners to expeditiously file or effectively prosecute bail application is caused by factors comprehended under Section 12 read with Section 13 of the Act,  (VI) to approach prisoners who qualify for legal aid, educate them on their rights to filing bail applications without delay, and determine the nature of legal aid needed by them,  (VII) to provide legal aid and facilitate the filing of bail applications The case before the Court The Court was essentially dealing with the case of one Anil Gaur who belongs to an economically deprived class of citizenry and was abandoned by his near and dear ones after his imprisonment in connection with a murder case.  Since he did not have access to legal aid to file his bail applications in a timely manner before the trial court as well as the High Court, therefore, after being denied bail by the trial court in 2019, it took him over 3 years to file his subsequent bail plea before the High Court. Finding him eligible for bail, the Court ordered that he be released on bail in on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court.

The Supreme Court has observed that before before punishing a person for non-compliance of the decision of the Court, the Court must not only be satisfied about the disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, writ or other process but should also be satisfied that such disobedience was wilful and intentional.The bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and BR Gavai observed thus... The Supreme Court has observed that before before punishing a person for non-compliance of the decision of the Court, the Court must not only be satisfied about the disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, writ or other process but should also be satisfied that such disobedience was wilful and intentional. The bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and BR Gavai observed thus while closing a contempt petition filed in 2008 arises out of a family dispute between a father on one hand and his two sons from his first wife on the other hand.  In the contempt petition, it was alleged that the party in his attempt to overreach an order passed by the Apex Court in an earlier contempt petition, approached the Company Law Board and obtained an interim order. The contempt petitioner alleged that invoking the jurisdiction of the CLB and entertaining the said proceedings by the CLB, itself amounts to contempt.  The bench observed that a person does not commit contempt of court if during the pendency of certain proceedings, he takes recourse to other judicial proceedings open to him, even though the latter proceedings put the other party at a loss. It said: "It could thus be seen, that this Court has held, that such action of a person which he takes in pursuance of his right to take legal action in a court of law, will not amount to interfering with the course of justice, even though that may require some action on the part of the other party in connection with his own judicial proceedings. The principle is, that a party is free to take action to enforce his legal right. This Court has approved the view taken by Allahabad High Court in Hrishikesh Sanyal v. A.P. Bagchi and Radhey Lal v. Niranjan Nath , that a person does not commit contempt of court if during the pendency of certain proceedings, he takes recourse to other judicial proceedings open to him, even though the latter proceedings put the other party at a loss." The bench, then, explained the scope of contempt proceedings and observed that only wilful disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of the Court would amount to contempt. The Court said: "It can thus be seen, that this Court has held, that the contempt proceeding is not like an execution proceeding under the Code of Civil Procedure. It has been held, that though the parties in whose favour, an order has been passed, is entitled to the benefits of such 64 order, but the Court while considering the issue as to whether the alleged contemnor should be punished for not having complied with and carried out the directions of the Court, has to take into consideration all facts and circumstances of a particular case. It has been held, that is why the framers of the Act while defining civil contempt, have said that it must be wilful disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of the Court. It has been held, that before punishing the contemnor for non-compliance of the decision of the Court, the Court must not only be satisfied about the disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, writ or other process but should also be satisfied that such disobedience was wilful and intentional. Though, the civil court while executing a decree against the judgment-debtor is not concerned and bothered as to whether the disobedience to any judgment or decree was wilful and once the decree had been passed, it was the duty of the court to execute the decree, whatever may be the consequences thereof. In a contempt proceeding before a contemnor is held guilty and punished, the Court has to record a finding, that such disobedience was wilful and intentional. It has been held, that if from the circumstances of a particular case, though the Court is satisfied that there has been a disobedience but such disobedience is the result of some compelling circumstances, under which it is not possible for the contemnor to comply with the same, the Court may not punish the alleged contemnor." The court added that the contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature and the standard of proof required is in the same manner as in the other criminal cases. It said: "The alleged contemnor is entitled to the protection of all safeguards/rights which are provided in the criminal jurisprudence, including the benefit of doubt. There must be a clear-cut case of obstruction of administration of justice by a party intentionally, to bring the matter within the ambit of the said provision. The Court has also referred to the observations made by this Court in the case of Debabrata Bandopadbyay and Others v. State of West Bengal and Another, wherein it was observed, that punishment under the law of contempt is called for when the lapse is deliberate and in disregard of one's duty and in defiance of authority. The bench then proceeded to close the contempt petition observing that a case of wilful, deliberate and intentional disobedience of any of the directions given by the Court or acting in breach of an undertaking given to the Court is not made out.   Read Judgment    
The Madras High Court recently reiterated that a bail court, while considering an application under Section 167(2) CrPC was not concerned with going into the merits of the case. The court had to consider such an application for default bail by considering whether the statutory period for filing a charge sheet or challan had expires, whether the charge sheet or challan had been filed... The Madras High Court recently reiterated that a bail court, while considering an application under Section 167(2) CrPC was not concerned with going into the merits of the case. The court had to consider such an application for default bail by considering whether the statutory period for filing a charge sheet or challan had expires, whether the charge sheet or challan had been filed and whether the accused was prepared to and had furnished bail.  Justice Murali Shankar, while setting aside the decision of the lower court, also criticized the order passed by the Sessions Judge. The court expressed shock over the manner in which the impugned order was passed and the personal liberty of the accused was handled by the Judicial Officer.  This Court is at loss to understand that the Sessions Judge, who is having 19 years of experience in judicial service, has over looked the legal provisions and the legal dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and the way he played with the personal liberty of the appellant/accused, completely oblivious of a basic provision, which every Officer dealing in criminal cases comes across day in and day out.   The court pointed out that apart from experience, this legal knowledge was also being continuously imparted through State Judicial Academy. Thus, finding the conduct of the officer unacceptable, the court directed the Registry to call for an explanation from the concerned Judicial Officer.  Hence, the Registry is directed to call for an explanation from the concerned Officer in this regard.   The court also highlighted that personal liberty was an important aspect of our constitutional mandate. The court discussed the view taken by the Supreme Court in Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State ofAssam (2017) where the Apex Court had held that in matters of personal liberty, we cannot and should not be too technical and must lean in favour of the personal liberty and that in matters of personal liberty under Article 21 of Constitution of India, it is not always advisable to be formalistic or technical  The accused, who was the sole accused in a crime for the offences under Section 376(2)(n), 417, 506(i) IPC and Section 3(1)(w)(i), 3(2)(v) of SC/SC (POA) Act 1989, had moved for regular bail under Section 439 CrPC but the same was dismissed. Though he preferred an appeal, the High Court dismissed the same.  Subsequently, the accused filed another application under Section 167(2) CrPC which was dismissed by the Sessions Court. This impugned order was under challenge in the present case.   The High Court noted that even a bare perusal of the impugned order would show that the Sessions Judge had passed the order as if the petition was on for regular bail and not one under Section 167(2) CrPC. The Sessions Judge had failed to consider the judicial precedents laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision of Uday Mohanlal Acharya v.State of Maharashtra (2001) and even recently in M Ravindran v The IntelligenceOfficer, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (2021) wherein the courts have discussed the manner in which the Magistrate/court had to deal with applications for statutory bail under Section 167(2) CrPC.  Even in Madras High Court, in the decision of K. Muthuirul v. The Inspector of Police, Samayanallur (2022) had held that the bail Court while considering the bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., is having no power or jurisdiction to go into the merits of the case and to see as to whether the ingredients necessary for granting regular bail are available or not.

While granting a decree of divorce to a couple, the Kerala High Court recently ruled that a wife making secret phone calls to a man ignoring her husband's warning against the same amounts to matrimonial cruelty. Justice Kauser Edappagth in his judgment also observed that mere compromise would not amount to condonation of cruelty unless and until the matrimonial life was restored. "Making discreet phone calls frequently by the wife with another man disregarding the warning of the husband, that too at odd hours, amounts to matrimonial cruelty." It was also reiterated that to constitute cruelty, the conduct and behaviour of one spouse towards the other need only be of such a nature that it causes reasonable apprehension in the mind of the latter that it is not safe for him/her to continue the marital tie. The Court was adjudicating upon a husband's appeal challenging the verdict of a Family Court. The husband had moved the Family Court seeking dissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery and cruelty, but it was dismissed.  The husband's contention was that right from the inception of marriage, the wife has perpetrated various iniquitous acts making his life a living hell. It was also alleged that she has been maintaining an illicit relationship with the second respondent prior to her marriage and even thereafter. Advocate T.M.Raman Kartha appearing for the husband further submitted that a perusal of the printout of CD produced from the BSNL would show that there were frequent calls between the wife and the second respondent, suggesting an unholy relationship between them. Advocate M.B.Sandeep appearing for the wife disputed these claims and argued that she used to call the second respondent only occasionally that too for official purposes. The Court noted that merely for the reason that the wife used to make regular calls to the second respondent, it could not jump to a conclusion that their relationship was an illicit one and that there was an adulterous act between them.  It was further asserted that there must be a high degree of probability to substantiate the allegation of adultery. The evidence adduced by the husband was found to be insufficient to prove adultery even by a preponderance of probabilities.  However, it was observed that there were instances where the wife made calls during odd hours as well. For instance, on 28/2/2013, she had made 10 calls out of which 5 were missed calls between 10.40 p.m to 10.55 p.m. Justice Edappagath noted that although the said evidence is not sufficient to infer adultery on the part of the wife, the relevant question was whether making such calls would constitute mental cruelty.  The Court further recalled that right from the inception of marriage, the marital relationship was not cordial. In fact, they separated three times and reunited and underwent mediation and conciliation several times. The parties had finally decided to resume cohabitation. In that circumstances, the wife should have been more vigilant in her behaviour, the Judge noted. "According to the husband, she continued making calls with the second respondent in spite of his warning. It shows that even after the husband questioned the wife about her telephone conversation with the second respondent, and even after she realised that the husband did not like her making such telephone calls, she continued to make telephone conversation with the second respondent on almost all days, and several times on a single day," the judgment states. The Single Bench also found it pertinent to note that during evidence, the wife had deposed that she used to call the second respondent only on certain days.  However, documentary evidence proved otherwise. Therefore, the element of cruelty as alleged by the husband was satisfied in this case.  Furthermore, both the husband and the wife accused each other of committing a breach of the compromise.  "At any rate, it is not in dispute that there was breach of the compromise. The question is not who has committed the breach. The question is whether the compromise has been adhered to by both parties and whether there was normal resumption of conjugal relationship. Mere compromise would not amount to condonation of cruelty unless and until the matrimonial life was restored."  There was absolutely no material on record to indicate the resumption of conjugal life in its true spirit between the husband and the wife after the compromise.. Under such circumstances, the Court found it to be a fit case to grant a divorce to the couple.    
The Supreme Court of India on Monday held that claims raised by an obstructor including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property in execution proceedings filed by the decree holder against the judgment debtor, has to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court in the execution proceedings itself.

The Supreme Court of India on Monday held that claims raised by an obstructor including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property in execution proceedings filed by the decree holder against the judgment debtor, has to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court in the execution proceedings itself.  The Bench has held that in accordance with Order XXI Rule 101 CPC, an application filed under Order XXI Rule 97 with respect to resistance or obstruction to possession of immovable property have to be determined by the Court dealing with the application and for that a separate suit is not required to be filed. A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice BV Nagarathna has made the observations while delivering its judgement in a civil appeal filed by Bangalore Development Authority challenging the Karnataka High Court's order dismissing writ petitions filed by Bangalore Development Authority against the order passed by the Executing Court dismissing its applications under Order XXI Rule 97 CPC in Execution Case filed by the decree holder (R1) against the judgment debtor (R2) "Therefore, as per Order XXI Rule 101 CPC, all questions including questions relating to right, title or interest in the property arising between the parties to a proceeding on an application under Order XXI rule 97 or rule 99 CPC and relevant to the adjudication of the application shall have to be determined by the Court dealing with the application. For that a separate suit is not required to be filed. Order XXI Rule 97 is with respect to resistance/obstruction to possession of immovable property," the judgement authored by Justice MR Shah reads. The Bench noted that it is the specific case of the BDA that pursuant to the acquisition of the land in question, the BDA has become the absolute owner and the said land is vested in the BDA. Further possession was already taken over by the BDA and the land was handed over to the Engineering Section.  The Bench has therefore held that the applications submitted by BDA for impleadment in the execution proceedings and the obstruction against handing over the possession to the decree holder were required to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court by impleading the BDA as a party to the execution proceedings. It has further been observed that even though a substantive suit filed by the BDA against the decree holder and the judgment debtor to declare the lease agreement as null and void is pending, irrespective of the same, considering Order XXI Rule 101 CPC, the question relating to right, title or interest of the BDA in the suit property was required to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court. The Bench has passed the order and issued the directions in consideration of the following aspects: The BDA is claiming right, title or interest in the land in question being acquired under the provisions of the 1976 Act.The lease agreement between the decree holder and the judgment debtor is subsequent to the acquisition of the suit land.The case of BDA is that such a transaction is null and void once the suit land for which the lease agreement was executed was acquired under the provisions of the 1976 Act.The award was also declared and a notification under Section 16(2) of the Land Acquisition Act evidencing taking over possession of the land by BDA was also published.  "Therefore, when BDA which has submitted the obstruction/objection in the execution proceedings filed by the decree holder against the judgment debtor with respect to suit land which was acquired by BDA and when the BDA claims right, title or interest in the suit property, such obstruction was required to be adjudicated upon by the Executing Court while considering the application/obstruction under Order XXI Rule 97 or Rule 99 CPC," the Bench has held. While allowing BDA's appeal, the Bench has set aside the order passed by the Executing Court dismissing the applications filed by the BDA for impleadment in the execution proceedings and/ dismissing the obstruction application. The Apex Court has also set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dated 21.03.2016 dismissing the writ petitions filed BDA and upholding order dated 29.01.2015 passed by the Executing Court The Bench directed the Executing Court to implead the BDA in the execution petition and thereafter adjudicate upon the obstruction or objection raised by BDA including the question relating to right, title or interest claimed by BDA in the suit land on the basis of the acquisition of the suit property acquired under the provisions of the 1976 Act. The Bench has granted a time period of six months for completion of the same.  Case Title: Bangalore Development Authority vs N. Nanjappa and another   
The Calcutta High Court has recently set aside an order of conviction for the offence of murder under Section 302 of the IPC against the husband of the victim on the ground that the child witness being of extremely tender age when the incident occurred was unable to comprehend the circumstances and was also prone to tutoring.  In the instant case, the deceased had suffered burn injuries at her matrimonial home and had subsequently passed away in the hospital she had been admitted to. A Bench comprising Justice Bivas Pattanayak and Justice Joymalya Bagchi noted from the record that the concerned trial court had relied heavily on the deposition of the child witness who had been summoned by the Court under section 311 CrPC to record a finding against the appellant that is the husband of the victim.  Underscoring the need for the evidence of a child witness to be examined with utmost care, the Court observed,  "When the prosecution primarily rests on the evidence of a child witness, it is the duty of the Court to examine the evidence of the said witness with utmost care and circumspection. A child of tender years is prone to prompting and tutoring. Hence, an onerous duty is cast on the Court to examine the deposition of a child witness not only on his capacity and ability to understand circumstances but also on the possibility of the witness being tutored by persons who have control and custody over him." The Court further noted that the child of the deceased was barely two years when the incident occurred and that there is no clear proof with regards to the actual age of the child at the time of incident. It was also observed that while the admissibility of the evidence of a child witness is dependent on his ability to understand questions put to him and give rational answers thereto as per section 118 of the Evidence Act, probative value of his deposition would dependent on an additional factor, that is, his capacity to comprehend and understand the events at the time of occurrence. Opining further that the child witness was not in a position to comprehend the circumstances in which her mother had died, the Court observed further,  "In the present case, though the child witness was six years old at the time of his examination and was capable of answering questions, rationally, it must be borne in mind he was deposing with regard to events which occurred in 2010 when he was barely 31⁄2 years old (as per F.I.R.) and not even two years old (as per his own deposition in Court). The extremely tender age of the child witness, that is, between 2-3 years at the time when the incident occurred gives rise to serious doubt whether the said witness was able to comprehend the circumstances in which her mother had suffered burn injuries and died." The Court further noted that the child had deposed before the Court after four years of the incident and that in the meantime he had been in the control and custody of her maternal grandparents and uncles. The Court opined that had the child understood the circumstances in which her mother had suffered burn injuries, he would have certainly divulged hem to his maternal grandparents and uncles however none of them had deposed anything to this effect.  It was further held that in the absence of corroboration from the relations of the deceased who had custody of the child, it was difficult to rely on the evidence of the child witness which had been narrated for the first time in Court after four years. The Court also noted that it is possible upon being summoned by the Court that the child had been tutored by his maternal grandparents/uncles to depose against the appellant. Opining further that deposition of the child witness was fraught with inconsistencies, the Court underscored,  "Deposition of the child witness is, therefore, fraught with inconsistencies and exaggerations. Extreme tender age of the witness at the time of occurrence and the fact he had not narrated such facts to his grandparents or uncles with whom he had been residing for the last four years give rise to serious doubt as to his maturity to understand circumstances leading to the death of his mother. Hence, it would be unsafe to rely on this witness to come to a finding of guilt against the appellant." The Bench further noted that if the child witness is not to be believed, then there is no direct evidence to explain as to how the deceased had suffered burnt injuries. It was also opined that the attending facts and circumstances of the case do not wholly rule out the possibility of accidental burns. Accordingly, the Court acquitted the appellant by observing,  "These loopholes in the prosecution case leave a lingering doubt that the victim may have suffered accidental burn injuries which prompted her husband that is the appellant and her mother-in-law to take all measures to save her life. In this backdrop, I am inclined to extend the benefit of the doubt to the appellant and acquit him of the charge levelled against him." Case Title: Piyarul Sk v. The State of West Bengal

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to BJP Leader, Kailash Vijayvargiya, RSS member Jisnu Basu, and Pradeep Joshi in an assault case in view of the fact that the matter has reached the Supreme Court. The Court observed that the petitioners/bail applicants should be granted bail till October 25 as the matter before the Supreme Court is set to be heard on October 20. The Bench of Justice Harish Tandon and Justice Kausik Chanda was hearing the pleas of bail applicants including Vijayvargiya challenging the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore, directing the complaint filed by the victim woman to be treated as First Information Report. The facts in brief  As alleged by the victim woman, Vijayvargiya called her to his flat wherein the bail applicants committed rape on her, one after another, and she was forced to leave the flat in a vegetated condition.  Further, it was alleged that since thereafter, she was physically assaulted on multiple occasions; more precisely, 39 times on diverse dates and places, and ultimately two complaints were lodged, dated December 20, 2019 u/s 341/506(ii)/34 of the Indian Penal Code and u/s 341/323/325/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code, however, no FIR was registered. Thereafter, an application under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was filed on November 12, 2020, which was dismissed by the CJM, Alipore. The said order was assailed before the High Court by filing the Criminal Revisional Application. The said criminal revision application was allowed by the HC, setting aside the order of the CJM, Alipore, and the matter was remitted back for reconsideration to the CJM, Alipore. Finally, on October 8, 2021, and solely on the basis of the directions/orders passed by the High Court, CJM Court directed the complaint to be treated as FIR. Before the Court, it was contended by the Counsel for the petitioners that in the two complaints lodged by the woman, there was no single whisper of the gravity of the offence that was alleged in her application before the lower court. The Counsel for Basu argued that the closure reports filed by the investigating agency into the two complaints had arrived at the conclusion that the allegations were cooked up due to political vendetta. Court's observations At the outset, the Court took into account the arguments for the Counsels of the petitioners that the findings of the High Court in setting aside the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Alipore suffered from glaring infirmity and inconsistency, and the said order has now been challenged before the Supreme Court. Since the matter is likely to be listed on October 20, 2021, the Court was of the view that once the ball has rolled to the Supreme Court, the aspect cannot be overlooked at this juncture. "Since the origin of the instant case is founded upon the order of this Court, scrupulously followed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, in allowing an application under Section 156(3) of the Code, the matter largely depends upon the outcome of the Special Leave Petition and till such time, we feel that the petitioners should not be deprived of the personal liberty," the Court noted allowing their bail pleas till October 25.

The Allahabad High Court on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to one Julfikar who has been accused of subjecting a 9-year-old boy to forced circumcision for religious conversion purposes. The bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Gupta ordered that in the event of arrest of the applicant (Julfikar), he shall be released on anticipatory bail till the submission of the police report, if any, under section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. before the competent Court. As per the FIR, accessed by Live Law, Ghaziabad police received a piece of information through social media against the applicant with the allegation that he had converted the religion of the 9-Year-Old boy by adopting the correct procedure i.e. writing 'godnama' on a stamp of Rs. 50/- and by cutting the exterior part of the penis by a sharp-edged weapon. The accused was booked under Section 323, 326, 120-B IPC, Section 75/80 of the Juvenile Justice Act, and Section 3/5 of U.P. Law Against Religion Prohibition of Conversion Act. Now, he moved the High Court arguing that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case and that he has no concern with the conversion of the religion of the child. He also submitted that child's foster parents Soni @ Kunni Devi and Mithlesh Yadav had given the child to him and he had given the child to one Babli and Umar Mohammad.  It was further informed to the Court that Babli has been granted anticipatory bail by the court below and co-accused Umar Mohammad has also been granted regular bail, therefore, he may also be enlarged on anticipatory bail as he is ready to cooperate with the trial.  Against this backdrop, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, considering the nature of the accusation and the fact that the applicant is entitled to be released on anticipatory bail in the case, the Court allowed his plea. However, the Investigating Officer was directed to conclude the investigation of the case in accordance with law expeditiously preferably within a period of three months independently without being prejudiced by any observation made by the Court while considering and deciding the present anticipatory bail application of the applicant. Case title - Julfikar v. State of U.P. [CRIMINAL MISC ANTICIPATORY BAIL APPLICATION U/S 438 CR.P.C. No. - 7968 of 2022]   
The Allahabad High Court has observed that at the stage of bail, it is only to be seen whether provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act have been prima facie complied with or not and it cannot be precisely ascertained whether compliance with Section 50 of the NDPS Act had been substantially made or not, as the same can only be ascertained during the trial. The bench of Justice Sameer Jain observed thus while dealing with the plea of an NDPS Accused seeking bail on the ground that at the time of search and recovery, the mandatory provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act were not complied with. The case in brief It was the case of the accused, who was allegedly found in possession of 240 gms. of Alprazolam powder, that although the recovery memo states that an option was given to her to be searched either before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, in fact, her counsel submitted, no such option was ever given to her. It was further urged that in view of the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Arif Khan @ Agha Khan Vs. State of Uttarakhand, 2018 AIR (SC) 2123, it was imperative for the searching officer to produce the applicant before a Magistrate or Gazetted Officer and since the same had not been done, therefore, the entire recovery vitiates, thus, entitling the accused to bail. On the other hand, the A.G.A submitted that before the search, the accused was in fact, given an option to be searched either before a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer, however, as per the recovery memo, she did not opt for the same and stated that she may be searched by the Searching Officer and thereafter her search was made by two female police constables. Thus, it was argued by the state that the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act were duly complied with in its letter and spirit and, therefore, considering the non-obstante clause of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, the applicant should not be released on bail. High Court's observations At the outset, perusing Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the Court said that it is imperative on the part of the Searching Officer to take the accused before such an Officer, but if, even after giving the option to the accused, he does not opt to be searched either before a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer then, the officer can make a search himself without taking the accused either before a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer. In this regard, the Court also relied upon the Supreme Court's rulings in the cases of the State of Punjab Vs. Baldev Singh (1999) 6 SCC 172 and Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja Vs. State of Gujarat (2011) 1 SCC 609 and further observed thus: "...if in spite of appraising the right of accused he/she did not choose either to be searched before a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer then search may be taken by the empowered officer and it is not imperative on his part to take the accused either before a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer." Significantly, the Court also relied upon the Delhi High Court's ruling in the case of Nabi Alam alias Abbas v. State (Govt Of Nct Of Delhi), wherein it was held that once a suspect under the NDPS Act is informed about his right to be searched before a Gazetted Officer/ Magistrate but he chooses not to exercise that right, then the empowered officer can conduct the search of such a suspect without producing him before a Gazetted Officer/ Magistrate, for the said purpose. Read more about the Judgment here: S. 50 Of NDPS Act- Presence Of Magistrate During Search Of Contraband Articles Not Mandatory If Accused Waives His Right: Delhi High Court Consequently, finding that before taking a search, the empowered officer apprised the accused that she is having a right to be searched either before a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer but in spite of that she (applicant) did not opt for the same and with her consent, her search was made by two female police constables, therefore, the Court ruled, as per Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja case (supra), the empowered officer has complied the provisions of Section 50 of NDPS Act and it cannot be said that there is a violation of Section 50 of NDPS Act. The Court added that at the stage of bail, it is only to see whether prima facie provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act have been complied with or not. With this, the bail plea was rejected. About Section 50 of the NDPS Act It may be noted that Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act states that when any officer duly authorized under section 42 is about to search any person under the provisions of section 41, section 42 or section 43, he shall, if such person so requires, take such person without unnecessary delay to the nearest Gazetted Officer of any of the departments mentioned in section 42 or to the nearest Magistrate. Section 50 NDPS Act suggests that it is the duty of the Investigating Officer to apprise the accused of his legal right that his search for the possession of narcotics, be conducted in the presence of the Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer, however, if the accused waives off this legal right or consents (be it oral or written) then in a such a case the Investigating officer can conduct his search for the same.

The Allahabad High Court has granted final anticipatory bail to Amazon Prime Video head Aparna Purohit who is facing an FIR registered in Lucknow, for allegedly depicting Hindu gods in a bad light in the web series Tandav. The Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal considered the overall facts and circumstances of the case and consequently, came to the conclusion that the applicant deserved to be granted anticipatory bail. Essentially, Purohit was seeking anticipatory bail in connection with FIR against her whereinunder she has been booked for alleged commission of offences under Sections 66 (Computer related offences), 66F (Punishment for cyber terrorism) and 67 (Transmitting obscene material) IT Act, 2008 (as amended) apart from Sections 153-A (Promoting enmity between different groups), 295 (Defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion), 505(1)(b) (Public mischief), 505(2) (Statements promoting hatred between classes), 469 (Forgery for purpose of harming reputation) of IPC. As per the prosecution story, in the said web series, certain actors cast some scenes portraying 'God' in a very derogatory manner which hurts the sentiments of the public at large. It was the contention of the counsel for the applicant that she had not intended to hurt anyone's sentiment and there is no criminal history of the applicant. It was also argued that there is no possibility of the applicant to flee from justice, and, therefore, she is entitled for interim protection from this Court. In view of the submissions of the counsel for the applicant, the Court granted her bail by ordered thus: "In the event of arrest of the applicant involved in aforesaid case shall be released on anticipatory bail till the submission of police report, if any, under section 173(2) Cr.P.C. before the competent Court on his/her furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Station House Officer of the police station concerned." Recently, a Lucknow Court had allowed Purohit to travel abroad. Purohit had moved the Lucknow Court with her application seeking permission to travel abroad (Dubai) to meet her parents who were unwell. The application had been moved in view of Allahabad High Court's last year's order wherein she was asked to not leave the country without the permission of the Court. 
The Calcutta High Court on Thursday allowed a government school teacher to seek a transfer to a school nearer to her residence after taking into account the report filed by a Medical Board which had advised her to avoid long journeys owing to her health condition.

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday allowed a government school teacher to seek a transfer to a school nearer to her residence after taking into account the report filed by a Medical Board which had advised her to avoid long journeys owing to her health condition.  Opining that the school teacher cannot be made to risk her life, Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay underscored,  "..it is observed that a lady teacher with specific advice of the doctors of a Medical Board of a Government Hospital to avoid journey, cannot be compelled to attend the school which is at a distance of 142 kilometers. To and fro journey is 284 kilometers. Even if the petitioner arranges an accommodation nearer to the school, it cannot be said that she will never come to her in-laws' house or her father's residence from the rented house in school area. At the same time going against the advice of the doctors of the Medical Board means taking risk of her life." The concerned school teacher had filed the instant petition seeking a transfer on the ground that she had been facing difficulties in attending her school due to her medical ailments since 2015. She had further averred that the distance of the school from her residence is 142 kilometers.  The Court noted that a candidate can apply for transfer if such distance is above 25 kilometers and accordingly took into consideration that in the instant case the petitioner has to travel a distance of 142 kilometers, meaning thereby that the journey she has to undergo to and fro journey is 284 kilometers. It was further noted that the concerned Medical Board had examined the petitioner in the month of August, 2021 and had clearly advised her to avoid such a long journey.  Opining that her service period being less than 5 years cannot stand as an impediment in the way of her transfer, the Court observed,  "In such a situation when the Medical Board in their report dated 25.08.2021 advised her to avoid journey, it is immaterial whether the petitioner is short of some months service from five years as on date. The petitioner has not been transferred till date and that is why I am considering the present tenure of her service, it is slightly below five years. However, when advise is to avoid journey after medical test by not an individual doctor but a Medical Board the service period cannot stand in the way for transfer." Accordingly, the Court declared that there is no impediment for the petitioner for getting a transfer to a school nearer to her residence. The school was also directed to issue no-objection certificate in favour of the petitioner by April 29, 2022 which should be a physical copy duly signed and sealed by the Teacher-in-Charge of the school. The Court further ordered that the petitioner should submit a handwritten or typed application for her transfer along with a copy of this order to the District Inspector of Schools by May 5, 2022 and the District Inspector of Schools shall forward the same to the School Service Commission by May 12, 2022. The petitioner was also allowed to select vacancy in other schools nearer to her residence including the vacancies in schools which she has already selected, if those are not filled up in the meantime since she had filed the application for transfer on September 11, 2021, i.e. more than seven months back.  "The Commission is directed to issue recommendation letter for transfer by 26th May, 2022 and the President of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education should issue the appointment letter for the school selected by the petitioner and recommended by the Commission by 9th June, 2022. The school authority, where the petitioner will go for joining, shall allow the petitioner to join the school without any hindrance of any kind whatsoever", the Court ordered further.  The concerned school was also directed to transfer the money accumulated in the Provident Fund Account of the petitioner to the school where the petitioner would join, by two months from the date of the intimation. The petitioner was also directed to communicate this order to the school by Friday 12 noon.  Case Title: Snigdha Datta (Basu) v. The State of West Bengal & Ors.      
The Telangana High Court recently permitted the petitioner, accused under Section 498-A IPC, to travel abroad to pursue his employment subject to executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh before the trial Court and offering bank guarantee for the said amount before the departure.

The Telangana High Court recently permitted the petitioner, accused under Section 498-A IPC, to travel abroad to pursue his employment subject to executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh before the trial Court and offering bank guarantee for the said amount before the departure.  "It is made clear that if the petitioner fails to return to India within the stipulated time, the personal bond and bank guarantee/FDR offered by the petitioner shall stand forfeited in favour of State Government without any notice."  The petitioner who is the accused is a citizen of USA. The petitioner was alleged to have committed the offences under Section 498A of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 showing the petitioner as absconding. When the petitioner visited India to meet his parents, the police officials detained him on ground of issuance of a Look Out Notice. However, he was released on bail on furnishing the sureties but was directed to not leave India without permission of the Court.  The petitioner filed a petition before the Additional Metropolitan Magistrate to permit him to travel to USA to report to his duties. However, the same was dismissed on the ground that the petitioner had not disclosed when he would return for proceeding with the case and had not given any undertaking with regard to the steps that would be required for closure of the case.  Aggrieved by the dismissal, the petitioner filed a Criminal Petition u/s 439 CrPC before the High Court along with an undertaking affidavit wherein he stated that liberty may be granted to file a petition u/s 205 of CrPC to be represented by a Special Vakalath Holder for the smooth functioning of the Trial including examination u/s 251 and 313 of CrPC. Furthermore, he promised that he shall return to India as and when directed by the Trial Court at appropriate stage or by the end of October, 2022 whichever is earlier.  Considering the said facts, Justice Juvvadi Sridevi permitted the petitioner to travel abroad for a period of 6 months and kept the LOC issued against the petitioner in abeyance.

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed a petition moved by two Railway Stations Auto Rikshaw Drivers' Unions seeking financial assistance from the State Government under the Atma Nirbhav Gujarat Scheme after observing that the petitioners cannot claim financial assistance as a matter of right. Observing that all businesses and professions have badly been hit by the covid 19 pandemic, a division bench comprising of Justice Bela M. Trivedi and Justice Bhargav D. Karia observed thus: "It cannot be gainsaid that the rigour of Covid Pandemic had affected the lives and livelihood of people world over and has caused great financial losses to every sector of the society." Furthermore, it said: "Under the circumstances, the petitioners cannot claim as a matter of right to get financial assistance or monetary benefits for auto rickshaw drivers, more particularly when all the businesses and professions have been badly affected due to the Pandemic." The development came after the petitioners approached the High Court challenging State Government's order dated 12th March 2021 wherein it was resolved that a separate relief package for the auto-rickshaw drivers in view of the Atma Nirbhar Gujarat Sahay Yojna will not be granted. In view of this, the plea sought reasonable financial assistance to the members of the petitioners unions for the period of lockdown and thereafter for the survival of their families in view of sec. 12 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. During the course of hearing, Advocate KR Koshti appearing for the petitioners submitted that huge financial loss was suffered by members of the unions and that the State had not granted any specific reliefs or facilities to the persons who are working as unorganized or self employed workers. Therefore, it was submitted that the auto rickshaw drivers should have been treated as self- dependent persons and should have been given special relief package by providing financial assistance under the provisions contained in the Disaster Management Act. "It can also not be denied that the State Government considering the plight of the people at large has provided reliefs in terms of free food, medical cover and shelter, etc. from time to time and has also granted ex-gratia assistance on account of loss of livelihood." The Court said at the outset.

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to a man who allegedly shared intimate pictures of his girlfriend with her family members as it noted that this was an exclusive case of betrayal of the faith of the victim by the applicant. The Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi also observed that while the victim permitted the accused to have those photographs under certain confidence and understanding, the applicant/accused had backstabbed her and betrayed her to its core. The case in brief As per the FIR lodged against the bail applicant by the victim-girl, they both came into contact with each other through the Facebook platform, and thereafter, they came into a relationship. Further, she has alleged that after crossing all the limits of decency and chivalry, the applicant-accused outraged her modesty. Thereafter, allegedly he took certain intimate "videos and pictures" in intimate condition, and thereafter, he started exploiting her. He kept on transgressing his limits quite often and then started sending lascivious and objectionable WhatsApp chats with her, just to threaten and to feel her embarrassed and uneasy. Further, in February 2021, when she was going to her room, en route she was intercepted by the applicant, thereafter, he misbehaved with her and extended all sorts of threats, and hurled filthy abuses at her. In her 164 Cr.P.C. statement, the girl stated that after taking her pictures, the bail applicant accused started blackmailing her and threatened her to send those videos and photos to her family members and would make it viral.  Horrified by this, she started dancing to his tune, and eventually, the accused sent all those photos to her family members and also threatened to make those pics viral in public. The applicant was thereafter arrested and is behind the bars since August 2021 in connection with a case against him under sections 376, 504, 506, 507, 354, 354(Kha) of IPC and Section 67 of the I.T. Act. Court's observations  Taking into account all the facts and material on record, the Court noted that the acts of the bail applicant indicated his selfish and short-sighted approach and he, in order to establish the consensual relationship, mercilessly sacrificed the victim's dignity and honor on the road. Regarding the act of sharing the snaps and calling accused, the most gender insensitive and crooked person, the Court remarked thus: "She has permitted to have those photographs under certain confidence and understanding with the applicant but the applicant now backstabbed her and betrayed her to its core, just to establish his point. Naturally, the victim has to pay its heavy price in the future. Under these circumstances, the applicant cannot be permitted to roam around freely, without paying the price of this sin. In the nutshell, this is an exclusive case of betrayal of the faith of the victim by the applicant. In her 164 Cr.P.C. statement, she clearly states that the applicant has forwarded those intimate photographs to her family members and the author of those pics are none other than the applicant alone." After assessing the material on record, the Court observed that the applicant did not deserve any sympathy, therefore, keeping in view that it is the applicant who exploited his relationship for his joy, thereafter, winning the victim's confidence, succeeded in getting those intimate photographs and lastly started blackmailing her, the Court denied him bail.   
The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted conditional bail to a man accused of beating people were returning back to their house raising the slogan of 'Jai Sri Ram.  The Bench of Justice Jayant Banerjee ordered the release of the accused (Irfan) on a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/ with two sureties. As per the prosecution version, at about 8.00 pm, the complainants/victims were returning back to their house raising the slogan of 'Jai Sri Ram', and that is when the applicant's side started abusing them and when they protest the same, they were beaten by the 'batt' of 'tamancha', 'balakati' and 'iron rod'. Pursuant to this, Accused Irfan was booked under Sections 147, 148, 504, 307, 354Kha, 324 IPC. Now, before the High Court, the applicant's counsel submitted that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present crime and that the applicant's side also received injuries. It was further submitted that no specific role was assigned to any of the accused persons by the injured and the complainant and only a general role was assigned to the accused person.  It was also submitted that there is no apprehension that after being released on bail, he may flee from the course of law and the applicant is in jail since March 11, 2022, and that the possibility of conclusion of the trial in near future is very bleak. Lastly, it was contended that it is a case of parity inasmuch as the other co-accused have already been granted bail by this Court.  In view of this, the Court directed that the applicant- Irfan be released on bail in the case on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/ with two sureties each of the same amount to the satisfaction of the court Case title - Irfan v. State of U.P.    
The Supreme Court observed that merely because an application is filed under Section 34(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act by a party, it is not always obligatory on the part of the Court to remit the matter to Arbitral Tribunal. "When it prima facie appears that there is a patent illegality in the award itself, by not recording a finding on a contentious issue, in such cases,... The Supreme Court observed that merely because an application is filed under Section 34(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act by a party, it is not always obligatory on the part of the Court to remit the matter to Arbitral Tribunal.  "When it prima facie appears that there is a patent illegality in the award itself, by not recording a finding on a contentious issue, in such cases, Court may not accede to the request of a party for giving an opportunity to the Arbitral Tribunal to resume the arbitral proceedings.", the bench comprising Justices R. Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy observed. The court said that the discretionary power conferred under Section 34(4) of the Act, is to be exercised where there is inadequate reasoning or to fill up the gaps in the reasoning, in support of the findings which are already recorded in the awar As per Section 34(4) of the Act, upon a request by a party, the Court may adjourn the proceedings for a period determined by it in the order to give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of Arbitral Tribunal, will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award. In this case, an Arbitration award was passed by the Arbitrator in a dispute between I-Pay Clearing Services Private Limited and ICICI Bank Limited. The latter challenged the award by filing a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The Arbitrator has framed five points for determination and Point No.1 was, "Whether the contract was illegally and abruptly terminated by the respondent?". The main ground in the application filed under Section 34(1) of the Act by the ICICI Bank, is that the  Arbitrator without recording any finding on Point No.1,  awarded Rs.50 crores to the I-Pay.  In the said proceedings, I-Pay filed an application under Section 34(4) of the Act, for adjourning the proceedings for a period of three months by directing the  Arbitrator to issue appropriate directions/ instructions / additional reasons and / or to take such necessary and appropriate action. The High Court held that the defect in the award is not curable, as such, there is no merit in the application filed under Section 34(4) of the Act and dismissed the same. In appeal before the Supreme Court, it was contended that lack of reasons or gaps in the reasoning, is a curable defect under Section 34(4) of the Act, and therefore the award can be remitted to the arbitrator to give reasons. That the provision under Section 34(4) of the Act can be utilised in cases where the arbitral award does not provide any reasoning or if the award has some gaps in the reasoning. According to ICICI bank, as the Arbitrator has passed the award by ignoring important and relevant evidence on record, it suffers from perversity and patent illegality, which cannot be cured on remittal under Section 34(4) of the Act by the Arbitrator. Under guise of adding reasons, the Arbitrator cannot take contrary view against the award itself, it was contended. The court, while dismissing the appeal made the following observations: It is the discretion vested with the Court for remitting the matter to Arbitral Tribunal to give an opportunity to resume the proceedings or not.  Further, Section 34(4) of the Act itself makes it clear that it is the discretion vested with the Court for remitting the matter to Arbitral Tribunal to give an opportunity to resume the proceedings or not. The words "where it is appropriate" itself indicate that it is the discretion to be exercised by the Court, to remit the matter when requested by a party. When application is filed under Section 34(4) of the Act, the same is to be considered keeping in mind the grounds raised in the application under Section 34(1) of the Act by the party, who has questioned the award of the Arbitral Tribunal and the grounds raised in the application filed under Section 34(4) of the Act and the reply thereto. Merely because an application is filed under Section 34(4) of the Act by a party, it is not always obligatory on the part of the Court to remit the matter to Arbitral Tribunal. The discretionary power conferred under Section 34(4) of the Act, is to be exercised where there is inadequate reasoning or to fill up the gaps in the reasoning, in support of the findings which are already recorded in the award. Under guise of additional reasons and filling up the gaps in the reasoning, no award can be remitted to the Arbitrator, where there are no findings on the contentious issues in the award. If there are no findings on the contentious issues in the award or if any findings are recorded ignoring the material evidence on record, the same are acceptable grounds for setting aside the award itself. In absence of any finding on contentious issue, no amount of reasons can cure the defect in the award.  Under guise of either additional reasons or filling up the gaps in the reasoning, the power conferred on the Court cannot  be relegated to the Arbitrator. In absence of any finding on contentious issue, no amount of reasons can cure the defect in the award. A harmonious reading of Section 31, 34(1), 34(2A) and 34(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, make it clear that in appropriate cases, on the request made by a party, Court can give an opportunity to the arbitrator to resume the arbitral proceedings for giving reasons or to fill up the gaps in the reasoning in support of a finding, which is already rendered in the award. But at the same time, when it prima facie appears that there is a patent illegality in the award itself, by not recording a finding on a contentious issue, in such cases, Court may not accede to the request of a party for giving an opportunity to the Arbitral Tribunal to resume the arbitral proceedings. Further, as rightly contended by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent, that on the plea of 'accord and satisfaction' on further consideration of evidence, which is ignored earlier, even if the arbitral tribunal wants to consciously hold that there was 'accord and satisfaction' between the parties, it cannot do so by altering the award itself, which he has already passed.

The Madras High Court has recently dismissed a batch of pleas challenging the premature release of 13 convicts who were convicted in the infamous Melavalavu Massacre.  The Melavalavu Massacre was a caste-based violence where a group of men murdered seven people including the Village Panchayat President and Vice-President as they refused to accept a person from the Dalit Community as their village head. 40 men were arrested — the trial court acquitted 23 and convicted 17 for offences under Section 302 r/w 34 IPC and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The conviction was upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court.   Of the 17 convicted, one died in prison and three were released prematurely in 2008. To commemorate the Birth Centenary of former Chief Minister MG Ramachandran, the State framed a scheme for considering the cases of premature release of convicted prisoners who have completed 10 years of imprisonment. The State government thus decided to give amnesty to these life convicts in 2019.  While refusing to interfere with the order of the Government, the division bench of Justice G Jayachandran and Justice Sunder Mohan of the Madurai Bench noted that the order of premature release was made after due consideration exercising the State's power conferred under Article 161 of the Constitution. It included objections from the victim’s family and the conduct of the accused.  "In the instant case, we find the impugned order of premature release been issued after due consideration of facts relevant. It includes the objections from the side of victims and the conduct of the prisoners during the parole and in prison, the law and order situation prevailing in the Village after three out of 17 convicts released prematurely earlier, the parity between those three convicts and the remaining 13 convicts (one died due to illness)."  The petitioners had challenged the premature release by submitting that one of the convicts was previously convicted of committing the double murder of members belonging to the Schedule Caste community which disentitled him to get the benefit of remission.  The State had also failed to take into account the fact that the villager was prone to caste discrimination and leaching violence against SC members, it was argued.  "Numerous cases registered under the SC & ST (POA) Act, 1989 in the Melavalvu Police Station in the past would show that the premature release of these convicts is not conducive for the peace, tranquillity and safety of the oppressed class. Without considering the safety of the victims family, the State has exercised its power to release them prematurely without application of mind," it was contended.   The petitioners also submitted that even though the convicts were acquitted under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, a division bench of the High Court had, while upholding the conviction, said that there was enough material to hold them guilty.   The State, however, submitted that the decision for premature release was made after following due procedure and taking into consideration all the relevant factors. Further, with respect to one of the convicts charged with double murder, the State submitted that he was acquitted under the SC & ST (POA) Act.   The court noted that the State had considered all relevant factors while granting premature release.   "It is further reported by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor through the status report that there is no law and order problem either when the prisoners were released on parole on various occasions and also after their premature release. This justifies the discretion of the State exercising its prerogative power applying mind considering all relevant materials."  Thus, the court refused to interfere with the order and dismissed the petitions.  Case Title: P Rathinam v. State of Tamil Nadu and others

While considering a series of transfer petitions moved by a woman, the Kerala High Court ruled that shifting from permanent residence to a temporary residence by itself is not a ground to transfer cases pending within the jurisdiction of the permanent residence of both parties. Justice A. Badharudheen dismissed the transfer petitions observing that allowing such pleas would result in cases being transferred frequently: "The rational is; in the case of temporary residence, particularly rental accommodation, the same is not at all static and it can be changed for any immediate reason. If cases are transferred to such temporary abode, again and again cases will have to be transferred, when the temporary residence being shifted. Therefore, I am of the considered view that availing a temporary residence, either by way of rental accommodation or otherwise shall not be a ground to allow transfer of cases on the mere plea that the said place is convenient to the wife." The petitioner, originally a permanent resident of Pala, filed the petitions seeking the transfer of two petitions before the Family Court in Pala to the one in Attingal. Her husband (respondent) is also a resident of Pala. The transfer petitions were filed on the ground that the petitioner recently shifted her residence to a rental house in Attingal following her appointment as Digital Marketing Trainee.  Appearing for the petitioner, Advocates P.T. Abhilash and L.D. Lijoroy submitted that the petitioner has been residing in Attingal along with a 3-year-old child and therefore, has been experiencing difficulties travelling to Pala to conduct the cases. Opposing the petitions, Advocate P.C. Haridas representing the respondent submitted that a shift in place of residence by the petitioner at her convenience that too in a rental house, cannot be a reason to transfer cases at her convenience, relying on Vidhya Mundekkat v. Akhilesh Jayaram (2021 (6) KHC 506) Referring to the said Division Bench decision, they also argued that it is not an invariable rule that whenever a wife makes a request pointing out her inconvenience, transfer of a case to a court of her choice is automatic. The crucial question before the Court was whether a temporary shift of residence by the wife is a reason to transfer of cases within the jurisdiction of the said temporary residence. Noting that the transfer petitions were filed only on the ground that the petitioner shifted her residence to Attingal, that too in a rental house, the Court found that shifting a permanent residence to a temporary residence by itself could not be a ground to transfer cases pending within the jurisdiction of the permanent residence of both parties.  As such, finding no merit in the petitions, they were dismissed.  Case Title: Meria Joseph v. Anoop S. Ponnattu  
The Delhi High Court has said that it is imperative for a court to look at a Will from the eyes of a layman rather than a lawman for reaching a final outcome. A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Saurabh Banerjee observed that it is the foremost duty of the Court to carefully give a purposeful meaning to the words and logical interpretation to the language used in a Will to infer and draw the real intention of the testator. "A Will will be a Will only when it will lay to rest the wishes of who is at rest. We will endeavor to proceed so that the Will of who lays at rest is put to rest," the bench said in the beginning of its ruling dated October 11. The court observed that as far as possible, all the clauses in a Will must be given equal importance, benefit and uniformity in conjunction with each other and not disjointly. "The clauses in a Will are like Sailors on a ship sailing in the same direction. Each clause has an individual value like each Sailor has an individual role to play. Thus, a Will has to be harmoniously construed under all circumstances," said the court. At the outset, the court noted that disputes regarding interpretation of a Will have been knocking the legal doors since time immemorial and though such doors have been successfully closed by numerous pronouncements, but, unfortunately the said issue will always be burning as there can be no closure to it. Since a meaning is sought to be given to the testator's intention as to what he must have meant when he was alive while making the Will, due importance has to be given to the surrounding circumstances including the testator's background, status and relations with the family and society, the court said. "The purpose must be to derive the real intention of the testator and recognize the dispositive rights of the beneficiaries for reaching a conclusion as far as practically possible. The Court is to look behind the cloak and lift the veil," it added. Furthermore, the court observed that a Will has to be read as a whole, adding that any contradictions, inconsistencies or variations have to be brought to variance with each other on a level playing field.  "The intention ought to be inferred from the words and the language used in the Will without reading into them or drawing any preconceived notion and without tinkering with the basic structure of the Will for deciphering their true literal meaning. The words in the Will ought to be given a plain, simple and grammatical meaning as per Dictionary without any if(s) or but(s)," said the court. The court also said some clause(s) in the Will are or can be overstepping on each other and as the same cannot be altered or no explanation can be sought from the testator.  "It should be made sure that such clause(s) do not trample upon each other so as to negate any one of them. In case the clause(s) are inconsistent and a divergent meaning is possible, the order of precedence should be followed, i.e., the more powerful/meaningful clause(s) is to take precedence over the less meaningful clause(s)," the bench said. The court also opined that when a Will contains a clause bequeathing absolute rights, then the same cannot be followed by other clauses with restricted rights. It observed that an absolute right is an outright recognition which cannot be fettered by imposing a condition in the form of a restrictive right.  "Where words in a clause can be interpreted in more than one way, it would be in the interest of things to choose and give the best possible, plausible, constructive meaning in the overall interest of everybody so as to draw a "single straight line‟ with no breakers rather than falling back on something which is implausibly destructive against the interest of everybody. In such situations, the meaning which furthers the cause ought to be chosen rather than which goes against the cause," the court said. It added, "The Court steps into the shoes of a kapellmeister and at the end of the day as everybody likes a melodious song, it is the duty of the Court to choose the music which is ears to the soul." Furthermore, the bench observed that the words and clauses of the same Will must not be picked or chosen out of context, adding that all the words must be regarded as essential whereas all the clauses should be reconciled with each other and must be read together 'as being part and parcel of the same document'. However, the court added that in case where it is not possible to do the same, a more beneficial interpretation should be adopted so as to bring a hiatus to the conflicting situation.  The court made the observations in a case related to a will declaring that the house shall belong to all the four children with each having 25 percent share in the property.

In the recent judgement, the Supreme Court through a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli upheld an important position of law pertaining to Dowry Death and the presumption of guilt in cases relating to it. The ingredients of Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act have been explained. The court also placed reliance in the proximity test laid down in the landmark case of Maya Devi and Anr. V. State of Haryana (2015) 17 SCC 405.  The judgement authored by Justice Hima Kohli notes that in order to meet the applicability of Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code, the following pre-requisites must be met:  "(i) that the death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurred otherwise than under normal circumstance;  (ii) that such a death must have occurred within a period of seven years of her marriage;  (iii) that the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment at the hands of her husband, soon before her death; and  (iv) that such a cruelty or harassment must have been for or related to any demand for dowry."     The court also notes that Section 304B IPC read in conjunction with Section 113B of the Evidence Act leaves no manner of doubt that once the prosecution has been able to demonstrate that a woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry, soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty or harassment in connection with the demand for dowry, have caused a dowry death within the meaning of Section 304B IPC.  Factual Background  The deceased in this case is contended to have been killed by her in-laws in relation to the demand of dowry. The deceased had been married to the husband accused for a few months and there had been multiple witnesses before the court who testified that she was subject to the demand of dowry and her in-laws even threatened her that if she does not bring the dowry demanded, her husband shall be remarried to someone else. On one day, the deceased went missing and seven days later her body was recovered from a waterbody with no ante mortem injuries.   The court heard two appeals together in this case. The first appeal has been brought by the mother-in-law of the deceased and the second appeal has been brought by the husband of the deceased. On September 20, 1999 the Trial Court convicted both the appellants under Sections 304B and 201 read with Section 34 if the IPC and sentenced them to a rigorous imprisonment of ten years and three years respectively on each count with both the sentences running concurrently. The High Court in its impugned judgement upheld the decision of the Trial Court.  Arguments by the Counsels   The counsel for the appellant failed to provide a plausible explanation as to her disappearance. An argument was made that the body recovered from the waterbody was unidentifiable however the father of the deceased recognized it on the basis of the clothes worn and some part of the face remaining intact. Another argument was made that the accused was working in Kolkata during the time the incident took place, however the same could not be proved before the court.  The prosecution's case was well established against the husband accused through the testimony of multiple witnesses. No eye witnessed were produced before the court however the circumstantial evidence had been corroborated to prove the guilt of the accused.  The Court after having heard both the parties came to the conclusion that the evidence against the accused had been corroborated to establish the prosecution's case well. The Court referred to the case of Bansi Lal v. State of Haryana (2011) 11 SCC 359 wherein it was stated that- "While considering the case under Section 498-A (Sic. Section 304-B), cruelty has to be proved during the close proximity of time of death and it should be continuous and such continuous harassment, physical or mental, by the accused should make life of the deceased miserable which may force her to commit suicide." The Court also placed reliance on the case of Maya Devi and Anr. V. State of Haryana (2015) 17 SCC 405 where it was held that- "To attract the provisions of Section 304-B, one of the main ingredients of the offence which is required to be established is that "soon before her death" she was subjected to cruelty or harassment "for, or in connection with the demand for dowry". The expression "soon before her death" used in Section 304-IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. However, the said expression would normally imply that the interval should not be much between the cruelty or harassment concerned and the death in question. In other words, there must be existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the death concerned. If the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale enough not to disturb the mental equilibrium of the women concerned, it would be of no consequence."  In the judgement, the court emphasizes that the expression "soon before her death" used in Section 304-IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test which does not define any particular time period and must be applied on a case-to-case basis. Further, elaborating on the presumption raised under Section 304B of IPC, the Court states:  "Section 304B IPC read in conjunction with Section 113B of the Evidence Act leaves no manner of doubt that once the prosecution has been able to demonstrate that a woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry, soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty or harassment in connection with the demand for dowry, have caused a dowry death within the meaning of Section 304B IPC. The said presumption is, however, rebuttable and can be dispelled on the accused being able to demonstrate through cogent evidence that all the ingredients of Section 304B IPC have not been satisfied." (Para 17)  The Court noted that the presumption of dowry death is raised in this case since the victim had gone missing from her matrimonial home within a few months of her marriage and immediately after demands of dowry were made on her and that her death had occurred under abnormal circumstances. Since the appellants have not been able to satisfy the presumption raised against them, the Court came to the conclusion that all the ingredients of Section 304B IPC have been met against the accused husband despite the prosecution's case resting solely on circumstantial evidence.    The Court concluded that the impugned judgement and order of sentence imposed on him is maintainable. For the accused mother-in-law the court came to the conclusion that no specific allegations had been made against her, nor any specific evidence or testimony pointed the guilt towards her. The court accordingly allowed her appeal and ordered for her release.

The Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has held that although different persons may react to a particular situation differently, mere refusal to repay a loan cannot in any way be considered to be an act of abetment to drive someone to commit suicide. In this regard, Justice Rajnesh Oswal added, "In order to constitute an offence of abetment, the act committed by the accused must be of such nature so that the deceased must be left with no other option but to take extreme step of ending his life." This observation was made by the High Court in a petition filed under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the challan arising out of FIR dated August 14, 2010 registered with Police Station Nowabad, Jammu for offences under Section 306 (Abetment to commit Suicide) of the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC), pending before the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Jammu and the order by virtue of which the charge for commission of offence under Section 306 had been framed against the petitioner.  Facts The deceased Ghan Shyam, aged 35-36 years was a street vendor and his mother-in-law i.e. the present petitioner, was also in the same business. The deceased had allegedly given Rs. 73,000/- as loan to the petitioner for her business and was himself indebted to many people, as he had also borrowed money from them for his business.  Being harassed by his lenders to clear his debts, on December 7, 2009, the deceased demanded from the petitioner the money, which he had given to given to her as a loan and it led to verbal altercation between the two which led to the deceased to say that if the petitioner did not clear her dues towards him, he would kill himself, as he is being harassed by the debtors.  The petitioner had then told the deceased that at that moment she had no money to return and this prompted the deceased to take an extreme step of stabbing himself with a knife in the chest. Submissions Before Court Advocate Basit M. Keng for the petitioner submitted that there was not even an iota of evidence on record that the petitioner at any point of time abetted the commission of suicide by the deceased, as such, the proceedings pending before the trial Court were nothing but an abuse of process of law.  AAG Aseem Sawhney for the State said that the trial Court had passed the order of framing the charges on the basis of evidence before the Court and the instant petition deserved to be dismissed. Findings The Court was of the opinion that the allegations against the petitioner do not constitute an offence under Section 306 RPC. In order to charge a person for commission of offences under Section 306 RPC, there must be evidence on record that the accused abetted the commission of suicide by the deceased., noted the Court. "One can be charged for the offence of abetment only when he instigates any person to do that thing or intentionally or engages with one or more other person in conspiracy for the doing of that thing or intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing," it said. Reliance was placed on the Supreme Courts' observations in Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke v. State of Maharashtra & Anr. where it was held that merely because a superior officer assigned work to his junior officer and took actions against him like stopping of his salary, he cannot be held to have a guilty mind or criminal intent, to attract offence under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, for abetment of suicide. In the instant case, the High Court observed, "Though the different persons may react or respond to a particular situation differently but this court is of the considered opinion that mere refusal to repay the loan cannot in any way can be considered to be an act of abetment to drive the deceased to commit suicide." It thus opined that the ingredients of offence under Section 306 of the RPC were absolutely lacking in the instant case and the trial Court had not considered this vital aspect of the case. Accordingly, the impugned order was set aside and the petitioner was discharged for commission of offences under Section 306 RPC and the challan stood dismissed.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that in absence of the material supporting the allegations or specifying details of such incident, it cannot be held that some activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of peace, public order and tranquility and that too when there is not any whisper in the record substantiating these vague allegations.  The observations were made by Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal while hearing a plea in terms of which the detenu through his father had challenged the legality and validity of the detention order issued by respondent under section 8 of the J&K Public Safety Act, 1978.  The main plank of the argument of the counsel for the petitioner was that the order impugned specifically reflected that the District Magistrate had simply perused the contents and recommendations mentioned in the dossier and had not seen the other connected documents while passing the order of detention, which clearly proved beyond any shadow of doubt that there was total non-application of mind and all the material had not been gone in detail while passing the order of detention, which vitiated the same and was hence liable to set aside.  The petitioner further contended that since all the material had not been taken into consideration by the Detaining Authority while passing the order of detention, the detenue had been denied of effective representation, which is in violation of section 13(1) of the Public Safety Act (PSA), 1978.  Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Nargal observed that it has been specifically mentioned that the detenue has pelted stones on the police party while passing through Sharshali Haj Mohalla, Khrew and thereby, they were prevented from discharging their lawful duties regarding which FIR No. 17/2020 was registered under sections 147, 148, 336 and 427 IPC in Police Station, Khrew in which he has been granted bail.  The bench however recorded that even though allegations of activities prejudicial to the maintenance of peace, public order and tranquility in the area have been made but these are without specifying the details of the persons and the exact date on which he met with the so called chronic stone pelters.  "In absence of the material supporting the aforesaid allegations or specifying details of such incident, it cannot be held that his activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of peace, public order and tranquility nor there is any whisper in the record substantiating these vague allegations", the bench maintained.  Explaining the effect of not specifying the details in the impugned order the bench observed that since no particular incident, event or details have been reflected in the grounds of detention which is the basis for passing the impugned order, accordingly, the detenue has been denied of effective representation as the detenue is not aware of the material which has been applied against him while passing the order impugned.  Buttressing the said position of law the bench placed firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in Khudiram Das v. State of West Bengal and others, (1975) wherein SC observed,  "All basic facts and particulars which influenced the detaining authority in arriving at the requisite satisfaction leading to the making of the order of detention must be communicated to the detenu. The judicial scrutiny cannot be foreclosed by a mere statement of the detaining authority that it has taken into account only certain basic facts and materials and though other basic facts and materials were before it, it has not allowed them to influence its satisfaction".  Elaborating its mind on the matter at hand the bench maintained that except general statements, there is no material on record which shows that the detenue is acting is such a manner, which is dangerous to the public order. The solitary incident in the present case in which he has already been granted bail is not enough to curtail the personal liberty of the detenue by passing the order impugned, the bench underscored.  For the foregoing reasons the bench allowed the petition and the impugned order of detention was set aside. It was further directed that the detenue be released from the preventive custody forthwith provided he is not required in connection with any other case(s).

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that in case of electricity consumption beyond the sanction load, the electricity consumer is liable to pay penalty in the form of demand surcharge. It thus dismissed an appeal against trial court's judgement granting mandatory injunction and restricting the respondents from discontinuing the appellant's electricity connection, subject to payment of dues. In this second appeal, the appellant sought refund of the amount paid. The bench comprising Justice Alka Sarin observed, "Since the plaintiff-appellant was consuming electricity in excess of the sanctioned load there is no occasion for him being refunded any amount by way of issuing a mandatory injunction."  After considering the rival submission of the parties, the court observed that as per the findings of the courts below, the plaintiff-appellant applied for an electricity connection of 95 KW load but vide an application he further requested for an electricity connection of 21 KW load. He also undertook to build-up the remaining load within next six months.  Subsequently, even when he was not sanctioned increased load, the usage was in excess making him liable to pay the surcharge of Rs.750/- per KW as per the instructions of the defendant-respondent.   Court further added that no question substantial of law arises in the present case therefore, concurrent findings of fact recorded by the Courts warrants no interference by this Court.  No question of law, much less, any substantial question of law arises in the present case. Both the Courts below have recorded concurrent findings of fact warranting no interference by this Court.  In view of the above, the court finding no illegality and infirmity in the judgments and decrees passed by the Courts below dismissed the appeal accordingly.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court observed in a recent case that a petitioner will not be deprived of the right to protest on an issue merely because he has approached a constitutional court on the same subject matter.In a recent writ petition before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and B.S.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court observed in a recent case that a petitioner will not be deprived of the right to protest on an issue merely because he has approached a constitutional court on the same subject matter. In a recent writ petition before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and B.S. Bhanumathi in obiter said:  "Approaching a constitutional court for redressal of grievances ipso facto would not disentitle a citizen from protesting in relation to the same subject-matter. We say for the reason that when the Court would be looking at the dispute, it would examine the matter only from a legal lens, based upon settled parameters of adjudication; whereas, the purpose of protest is to draw attention of the government to an issue."  It may be noted that the Supreme Court had taken note of the same issue in the context of recent farmers protest. In October last year, a bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar made a preliminary observation that a person can't hold public protests in a sub-judice matter and sought the assistance of the Attorney General for India to decide the matter. However, a different bench led by Justice SK Kaul made an oral observation while considering another matter related to farmers protests that the Court was not against right to protests even if the issue was pending before the Court. What was the case before AP HC? The petitioner filed the writ petition relating to grievance towards pay scales. The petitioner sought declaration that the G.O.M.s No. 1 of the Government of Andhra Pradesh dated 17.01.2022 was illegal and arbitrary and contrary to provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Re-Organization Act, 2014 and the Constitution of India.  The Advocate General contended that when the Court has already been called upon, by way of the writ petition filed by the Employees' Union, it was not proper for the Union to give a call for, or proceed on strike, which could bring the State's administrative machinery to a grinding halt. He submitted that though Article 19(1)(a) guarantees to all citizens right to freedom of speech and expression, it is not absolute.  The Advocate General relied on TK Rangarajan v. Government of Tamil Nadu, 2003 to submit that employees have no fundamental right to strike as it is a weapon that is mostly misused resulting in chaos and total maladministration.  However, the Bench noted that in Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan v. Union of India, 2018, it was held that the right to peaceful protest is recognized as a fundamental right under the Constitution and it rests on the participation of an informed citizenry in governance. It is crucial as it strengthens representative democracy by enabling direct participation in public affairs.  On the basis of the aforementioned cases, the Bench added that approaching a Court would not prohibit the person in question from protesting in a legally permissible manner, subject to the caveat being the extant rules and regulations guiding the person concerned, inclusive of his status, if so, as a government employee.   The writ petition was not decided on merits and it was directed to be listed before the appropriate bench as the matter in issue would not come under their roaster. The Bench further clarified that the remarks made are in the nature of obiter.   Cause Title: K V Krishnaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh   
The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that the right to change the name is a facet of a fundamental right as guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution of India and that such a right cannot be denied.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that the right to change the name is a facet of a fundamental right as guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution of India and that such a right cannot be denied.  Essentially, the bench of Justice Pankaj Bhatia observed this while hearing the plea of a lady (named Rajni Shrivastava) who wanted to change her name to 'Rashmi Srivastava', however, her application regarding this was rejected by the UP Secondary Education board. The board said that her application was rejected on the ground that in terms of the mandate of the provisions as contained in the Regulations under Chapter III Regulation 7 of the Regulations framed under the Intermediate Education Act 1921 that the said request was beyond the prescribed limitation under the said Regulations. However, allowing her writ plea, the Court directed the concerned authorities to carry out the desired change of name in the mark sheet and Certificate. The case in brief The petitioner wanted to change her name and therefore, she took steps for getting the same intent published in the newspapers. Pursuant to this, in her Aadhar card and Permanent Account Number (PAN), the changes were made and her name was recorded as Rashmi Srivastava.  However, there arose a discrepancy in the Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and the Bank Account on one hand as contrasted with the High School Certificate, the Intermediate Certificate, and the Graduation Certificate where the name of the petitioner was recorded as Rajni Shrivastava. Her application regarding her intent to change her name was rejected by the Secondary Education Board and a similar representation was rejected by the University authorities as well on the ground that unless the correction as desired by the petitioner is made in the High School records, no consequent action can be taken. Therefore, she moved to the High Court with her instant writ plea. Court's observations  The Court took into account the judgment in the cases of Kabir Jaiswal v. Union of India & Ors. and Jigya Yadav vs. C.B.S.E. LL 2021 SC 264 to note that the right to change the name is a facet of a fundamental right as guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution of India and cannot be denied.  Further, the Court said that the foundation based upon which the application of the petitioner was rejected namely that the request was made beyond the limitation prescribed under Regulation 7, was wholly untenable as the same militated against the law laid down by the High Court in the case of Anand Singh vs. U.P. Board of Secondary Education and others (2014) 3 ADJ 443 (DB). With this, the Court directed the petitioner to move an appropriate application afresh along with a copy of the Court's order and the documents including the Aadhar Card and the PAN Card before the concerned authority along with the original certificate and mark-sheet.  "On receiving such application, the respondent no.2 is directed to carry out the desired change of name in the marksheet and Certificate. However, it is clarified that in the fresh certificate and mark-sheet issued to the petitioner, it would contain the name 'Rashmi Srivastava alias/nee, Rajni Shrivastava'. The said exercise shall be completed by the respondent no.2 within six weeks from the date of filing of the application. The petitioner shall thereupon be entitled to file the application before the respondents no.3 and 4 along with original records who shall also make the necessary corrections in the educational certificates/records issued to the petitioner in the light of the said fresh certificate issued to the respondent no.2. It is further directed that the respondent no.2 shall carry out the necessary corrections in the intermediate examination records of the petitioner also which shall be in consonance with the name change, as recorded in the High School Certificate in terms of the directions given above," the Court further directed as it disposed of the plea.

The Bombay High Court recently held that a child who was born after the cut-off date but passed away before nomination, would not be counted to disqualify the parent from contesting panchayat elections under the Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act, 1959. Justice Arun R. Pedneker of the Aurangabad Bench set aside the authorities’ order disqualifying a woman on the ground that she had more than two children after the cut-off date.  “Thus a child, born after the cut-off date and has passed away before the nomination is not to be counted for the purpose of disqualification…In the instant case, since the authorities below have proceeded on the basis that, whether the child born after the cut-off date is dead as on the date of nomination is a immaterial fact, that the authorities have committed error in law in passing the impugned orders,” the court held. Section 14(1)(j-i) of the Act provides that a person having more than two children shall not be a member of the panchayat. However, candidates having more than two children before the cut-off date are protected from disqualification by a proviso to the section. The petitioner was declared elected unopposed as a member Gram Panchayat Nimgaon Khalu in January 2021. A resident of the village filed a complaint before the Additional Collector, Ahmednagar under section 14(1)(j-1) of the Act. He claimed that she had more than two children and one of the children was born after the cut-off date of September 9, 2001.  The Additional Collector disqualified her, and the appellate authority upheld the order of disqualification.  Advocate Suvarna Zaware for the petitioner contended before the high court that the child born on February 12, 2002 was a premature child and passed away shortly after birth on April 02, 2002. Advocate Prashant Nangare for the complainant disputed the birth certificate of the petitioner’s fourth child which records the date of birth as June 10, 2001 (before cut-off date). He argued that this child is actually the child who was born on February 12, 2002 (after cut-off date) as it is not possible to have another child within eight months of the birth of earlier child. The court relied on the full bench judgement in Subhash Sajesingh Gavit v. Returning Officer and said that the death of the child as well as proviso to Section 14(1)(j-1) would protect the petitioner. “Since the child born after the cut-off date being dead and more than two children born prior to the cut-off date being protected under the proviso to Section 14 (1)(j-1) of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959, the petitioner would not incur disqualification”. The court however, noted that the claim of death of the petitioner’s child itself is disputed. The doctor at the High Court Dispensary informed the court that it is medically possible to have a premature child born within the time frame and such a child would be very week. Hence, the petitioner’s contention that a premature child was born and expired is possible. The court said that the authorities have not considered the Subhash Sajesingh Gavit case which held that that the number of children has to be considered as on the date of nomination. “The Collector as well as the appellate authority – the Additional Commissioner has proceeded on the basis that if the candidate has more than 2 children and one of them being born beyond the cut-off date of 12.09.2001 the candidate incurres disqualification,” the court noted. The court further noted that the authorities did not consider the evidence regarding the demise of the child born on February 12, 2002 which is also disputed. Hence the court set aside the impugned orders and sent the matter back to the Collector for fresh consideration. It permitted the parties to lead the evidence as to whether the child passed away or not. The court noted that application for registering the death of the child born on 12.02.2002 is pending. The court advised the Magistrate to decide the application expeditiously as it will have a direct bearing on the case.

The Patna High Court on Thursday issues directions for expeditious conclusion of confiscation proceedings under the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016.  A division bench comprising of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar observed that the Court is "flooded with several petitions solely on account of non-initiation of such proceedings of confiscation or passing of illegal orders with respect thereto. Also, on account of lack of parties pursing the remedies so provided under the Act." The Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 prohibits the manufacture, storage, distribution, transportation, possession, sale, purchase and consumption of any intoxicant or liquor, unless so allowed in terms of the Act.  While sec. 56 of the Act lays down the procedure for confiscation of "things" used for in the commission of such an offence, sec. 58 gives power to District Collector/Authorized officer to issue an order of confiscation.  "It is seen that till date, in large number of cases, position about conclusion of the proceedings, be it under Section 58, 92 or 93 remains the same," the Court said.  Directions passed by the High Court  -	All proceedings under Section 58 must positively be initiated/concluded within a period of ninety days from the date of appearance of the parties.  -	Appeal/Revision, if any, be also decided within a period of thirty days from the date of initiation, failing which the "things" (vehicle/property/ etc.) shall be deemed to have been released in terms of several orders passed by this Court.  -	Wherever confiscatory proceedings stand concluded and parties could not file the appeal/revision within the statutory period of limitation, as already stands directed in several matters, if they were to initiate such proceedings within next thirty days, the plea of limitation would not come in their way of adjudication of such proceedings on merit.  Issuing the said directions, the Court ordered thus:  "We only hope and expect that the Authorities under the Act shall take appropriate action at the earliest and in accordance with law, within the time schedule fixed, failing which the vehicle/property/things liable for confiscation shall be deemed to have been released without any further reference to this Court."

The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted bail Former IPS officer Amitabh Thakur in the abetment to suicide case, in which a woman and her friend had set themselves on fire outside the Supreme Court and succumbed to burn injuries.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday granted bail Former IPS officer Amitabh Thakur in the abetment to suicide case, in which a woman and her friend had set themselves on fire outside the Supreme Court and succumbed to burn injuries.  "Admittedly, the charge sheet is already filed and there is no averment in the counter affidavit for tampering any evidence," the bench of Justice Rajeev Singh stated.  The woman had alleged that Thakur had helped the BSP MP Atul Rai in harassing and threatening her to withdraw her case or weaken it. Subsequent to this incident, the Uttar Pradesh government had formed a two-member probe panel to look into the allegations, which found the duo prima facie guilty. Consequently, Lucknow police lodged an FIR against Thakur and Rai and subsequently arrested Thakur on charges of Abetting the woman's suicide. The FIR against Thakur also contains charges under Sections 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 195-A (threatening any person to false evidence), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record, etc), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC. Hence, this bail application was been by Thakur seeking bail.  His counsel, Advocate Nadeem Murtaza, submitted that allegations are totally frivolous. The counsel further submitted that there is no evidence that the applicant played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing an act that facilitated the commission of suicide and there is no mens rea. It is also submitted that conviction under Section 306 I.P.C. is not sustainable without there being a 9 proximity to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused. The counsel for the Respondent, Advocate V.K. Shahi, submitted that the Applicant abused his position of power and his conduct comes into the category of instigation. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the court allowed the bail application admitting that the charge sheet has been filed and there is no averment in the counter affidavit for tampering with any evidence. It ordered, "Let applicant - Amitabh Thakur be released on bail on his furnishing personal bond of Rs.20,000/- and two reliable sureties each of the like amount." He has been directed not try to influence the witnesses or tamper with the evidence of the case.Further, he shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (a) opening of the case, (b) framing of charge; and (c) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C.Case Title: Amitabh Thakur v.

The Gauhati High Court recently upheld the order of a trial court wherein it had rejected a plea on the ground that the defence side had failed to prove the contradictions of the witnesses in accordance with law.

The Gauhati High Court recently upheld the order of a trial court wherein it had rejected a plea on the ground that the defence side had failed to prove the contradictions of the witnesses in accordance with law.  While examining the validity of such conclusion recorded by the learned trial court, the division bench of Justice Suman Shyam and Justice Robin Phukan relied on Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which laid down the manner in which cross-examination of the witnesses was to be made as to any previous statement made in writing. The Court relied on the case of V. K. Mishra and another Vs. State of Uttarakhand and another where the Supreme Court had the occasion to consider the correct manner of proving contradictions as to any previous statement made by a witness.  The Apex Court in that case had held, "Under Section 145 of the Evidence Act when it is intended to contradict the witness by his previous statement reduced into writing, the attention of such witness must be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him, before the writing can be used. While recording the deposition of a witness, it become the duty of the trial court to ensure that the part of the police statement with which it is intended to contradict the witness is brought to the notice of the witness in his cross-examination. The attention of witness is drawn to that part and this must reflect in his cross-examination by reproducing it. If the witness admits the part intended to contradict him, it stands proved and there is no need to further proof of contradiction and it will be read while appreciating the evidence. If he denies having made that part of the statement, his attention must be drawn to that statement and must be mentioned in the deposition. By this process the contradiction is merely brought on record, but it is yet to be proved. Thereafter when investigating officer is examined in the court, his attention should be drawn to the passage marked for the purpose of contradiction, it will then be proved in the deposition of the investigating officer who again by referring to the police statement will depose about the witness having made that statement. The process again involves referring to the police statement and culling out that part with which the maker of the statement was intended to be contradicted. If the witness was not confronted with that part of the statement with which the defence wanted to contradict him, then the court cannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved in compliance with Section 145 of the Evidence Act that is, by drawing attention to the parts intended for contradiction." In the instant case, the High Court found that the defence counsel had failed to invite the attention of the witnesses to any previous statements in writing so as to contradict the witnesses. Therefore, it was of the view that the defence could not be permitted to avail the benefit of such alleged contradictions, if any, in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses. These developments came in an appeal against conviction which was preferred by five appellants assailing the judgment and order dated 11.03.2019 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sonitpur, Tezpur in a case where charges were framed against the accused persons under sections 302 read with section 149 of the IPC. The trial court had sentenced each of them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and also to pay fine of Rs.5000/- each and in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three months each. The trial court had held that the prosecution has succeeded in establishing the charges brought against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt, both by direct evidence of the eye-witness as well as by the circumstantial evidence. It had further held that the deceased was last seen together with the accused persons and therefore, the circumstance of "last seen together" would also be an additional link in the chain of circumstances which would support the prosecution case. Furthermore, the defence counsel's argument that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses were full of inconsistencies and material contradictions raising serious doubt on the prosecution story was also rejected by the court below when it held that those were minor discrepancies which would have no bearing in the prosecution case.  The trial court had thus held that the defence side had failed to prove the contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses by following the due procedure laid down by the law. The High court went through the statements of all witnesses as recorded before the trial Court.  It was found that during his cross-examination the I.O. had brought on record certain contradictions in the testimonies of a few prosecution witnesses. Since these contradictions were heavily relied upon by the defence side so as to impeach the prosecution case, the Court dealt with them in greater details. The eye-witness had categorically deposed that he had seen 8/10 people including the appellants assaulting the deceased by means of "dao". The Court thus noted, The evidence of PW-4 could not be shaken during his cross – examination. However, it is also seen from his statement recorded by the Police under section 161 Cr.P.C that the PW-4 did not mention the name of Abdul Kadir Gilani as one of the persons whom he had seen to have assaulted the victim. The name of Gilani has been added by PW-4 for the first time while deposing before the court. From the above it is evident that there has been some exaggeration and embellishment in the testimony of this witness. The question is, should the evidence of this witness be discarded due such exaggeration and embellishment ? In this regard, the Court relied on the case of Leela Ram v State of Haryana, wherein the Supreme Court had observed that one hardly comes across a witness whose evidence does not contain some exaggeration or embellishment but the court can sift the chaff from the grain and find out the truth from the testimony of the witnesses. The evidence of such witnesses are to be considered from the point of view of trustworthiness. Total repulsion of the evidence would be unnecessary. "In the present case, we have noticed that there are some omissions such as failure on the part of the PWs-4 and 9 to state before the police that they had arrived at the place of occurrence in a motorcycle or that the PW-1 had failed to state that he came riding in a motorcycle and in the flash of headlight of the motorbike he had seen the assailants leaving the place. But such omissions, in our view, do not erode the credibility of these witnesses since the basic facts stated by them before the police do not contradict their earlier statements in a manner such that both their statements cannot co-exist. Moreover, as mentioned above, the defence side has also failed to prove the contradictions in the statement of these witnesses in the manner required by law. On the contrary, we find that the version given by PWs-1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 broadly bears up the same story without any vital contradictions and therefore, their evidence is found to be trustworthy", remarked the Court. The Court further relied on a decision of a Division Bench of the High Court rendered in the case of Ghanakanta Das & others Vs. State of Assam wherein it held that the procedure to be followed in order to contradict the evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses during trial with a statement made before the police during investigation would be to draw the attention of the witness to that part of the contradictory statement and question him as to whether, he did in fact make the statement.  "If the witness admits to have made the particular statement before the Police then his admission would be recorded and would form part of his testimony and can be relied upon by the accused as establishing the contradiction. However, if the witness denies of having made such statement before the Police then the particular portion of the statement should be previously marked for identification and when the Investigation Officer (I.O.) comes to the witness box, he should be questioned as to whether the witness had made the particular statement before him during the course of investigation. The answer of the I.O would prove the contradiction. Unless the said procedure is followed and the witnesses are given opportunities for explanation, their previous statements made before the police cannot be used for contradictions. On such failure, it was held that the testimony of the witnesses could not have been thrown out on the ground that their evidence before the trial court has been contradicted by the previous statements made before the police." In so far as ne of the appellant Md. Abdul Kadir Gilani was concerned, the Court held that evidence on record although indicated his presence in the place of occurrence but it was not sufficient to indicate his involvement in committing the offence. "Therefore, there is a genuine doubt as regards his actual involvement in commissioning the crime. As such, giving the benefit of doubt, the conviction of appellant Md. Abdul Kadir Gilani is hereby set aside and he is acquitted of the charges brought against him. Consequently, we direct that the appellant Md. Abdul Kadir Gilani be forthwith released from jail if his custodial detention is not required in connection with any other case", ordered the Court.  The appeal was thus partly allowed. Cause Title: Abdul Kadir and 4 Ors v State of Assam Senior Advoacte R. P. Sarmah, assisted by Advocate M. R. Adhikari, appeared for the appellants.  Additional Public Prosecutor, B. Bhuyan, appeared for the State/respondent No.1 and Advocate K. M. Haloi, represented the informant/ respondent No.2.    
The Kerala High Court on Friday directed Ilaha College of Arts and Science to admit a candidate who had been denied admission on the belief that he would disrupt the discipline of the College.  Justice Devan Ramachandran, while issuing the direction, was of the view that the petitioner was being denied admission to the College based on 'speculative reasons'.  "...it is evident that the College is refusing admission to the petitioner based on certain speculative reasons. It may be true that there was an incident in the past, which led to a police complaint being filed against the petitioner, but this does not ipso facto mean that his attempt is to 'wreck vengeance'", the Court observed. The petitioner in this case had been allotted the Ilaha College of Arts and Science (hereinafter 'College') by the MG University (the 1st respondent herein) for the B.A. Economics course. It is the case of the petitioner that despite presenting his memo of allotment to the Principal, he was not granted admission. Aggrieved, he preferred the instant writ petition. It was contended by the Standing Counsel for the College P.M. Saneer that the petitioner intended to 'wreak vengeance' upon the College, since the latter had denied admission to the petitioner on the ground of lack of merit, when he had earlier approached it to seek admission in Management quota. It was submitted that thereafter, the petitioner had created a ruckus in the college, because of which a complaint had been filed by the College against him to the Sub Inspector, Muvattupuzha Police Station. It was further submitted that the College had itself submitted a letter to the University on the bona fide belief that the petitioner would disrupt the discipline of the College, if admitted.  The Standing Counsel for the University Surin George Ipe contended that the College was attempting to 'wriggle out of its statutory obligation', and that the latter approached the University with the letter only on 6th October 2022, while the admission had to be completed by the end of September, 2022. It was added that since the admission procedure was completed, the actions of the College would have to be considered seriously.  The Court while allowing the admission of the candidate in this case, noted that if the College had any objection regarding the admission of the petitioner, the same ought to have been raised before the competent Authority before the next allotment period was completed.  However, the College was granted liberty to pursue the matter before the University, and the latter was also directed to decide the same after hearing both sides.  Importantly, the Court added that the petitioner was being admitted to the College on his express undertaking that he would act in strict compliance of the discipline of the College and would not exhibit any conduct in breach thereof. Advocates Philip M. Varughese, Mathews Joseph, Aiswaria Devi R., Chacko Mathews K., Sreekumar P.N., Emmanuel Cyriac, and Elizabeth George appeared on behalf of the petitioner.  Case Title: Muhammad Afreethi v. Mahatma Gandhi University & Anr.   
The Allahabad High Court has observed that the defect of non-filing an affidavit in support of an election petition at the stage of filing of an election petition cannot be cured by way of filing the subsequent affidavit.  The bench of Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery observed thus while confirming an order of an election tribunal that rejected an election petition filed under Section 12-C of U.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1947 on the ground of non-filing of the affidavit.  The Court concluded that the Election Tribunal had rightly rejected the election petition at a preliminary stage for the non-compliance of a mandatory requirement of filing an affidavit under Order 6 Rule 15(4) CPC.  Here it may be noted that the abovementioned provision states that the person verifying the pleading shall have to furnish an affidavit in support of his pleadings.  The case in brief  Essentially, an Election Petitioner, who was a runner-up in the Pradhani election filed an election plea (without any affidavit) challenging the election of the candidate who won y 16 votes and thus, was elected as a Pradhan.  The said election plea was rejected by the tribunal by allowing the preliminary objection raised by the petitioner (elected pradhan) that the election petition was not accompanied by an affidavit, which was a mandatory requirement under Order 6 Rule 15(4) CPC.  Being aggrieved, the election petitioner filed a Civil Revision which was allowed by the Additional District Judge, Court No. 1, Agra with the observation that the Election Tribunal had not taken note of the affidavit of the election petitioner filed subsequently duly affirming the contents of the election petition.   Consequently, the order impugned therein was set aside and the election petition was restored for hearing. Now, challenging that very order, the petitioner moved the High Court.  The petitioner argued that at the first instance, the election petition was filed without any affidavit in its support and it being a non-curable defect, could not be cured by way of filing a subsequent affidavit. On the other hand, the counsel for the election petitioner argued that since he had filed a subsequent affidavit, thus, the election plea was maintainable.  Court’s observations  Having heard the arguments of the counsels, at the outset, the Court noted that a challenge to an election of a returned candidate is a serious affair wherein the election petitioner has to set up a case to set aside the election on legal grounds and for that purpose, pleadings play an important role.   The Court further observed that though no specific format is prescribed for election petition under Act, 1947 as well as Rules framed thereunder, however, principle and procedure prescribed under the Code of Civil Procedure has to be followed and every pleading including an election petition has to be affirmed by an affidavit of election petitioner.  The Court added that in this regard a specific provision was inserted by Act 46 of 1999 w.e.f. 01.07.2002 under Order 6 Rule 15 (4) that “the person verifying the pleading shall also furnish an affidavit in support of his pleadings.”  The Court further relied upon the Bombay High Court’s ruling in the case of Ashok Tapiram Patil alias A. T. Nana Patil vs. Gurumukh Mehrumal Jagwani and others, (2006) 6 BomCR 832, wherein it was held that the election petition must be accompanied by an affidavit in support of pleadings of the election petition.  Consequently, finding the approach of the election tribunal in rejecting the election plea as appropriate, the Court set aside the order of the Additional District Judge, Court No. 1, Agra, and affirmed the Election Tribunal’s order  Appearances  Counsel for Petitioner: Kshitij Shailendra, Sandeep Kumar   Counsel for Respondent: C.S.C., Ajay Dubey, Kamini Pandey (Dubey)  Case Title – Lokendra Singh vs. State Of U.P.

The Delhi High Court has observed that a minor child is entitled to claim maintenance for his upbringing by the father and that such a child is not bound by the divorce settlement regarding maintenance between his parents.

The Delhi High Court has observed that a minor child is entitled to claim maintenance for his upbringing by the father and that such a child is not bound by the divorce settlement regarding maintenance between his parents.  Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh was dealing with an appeal filed by a minor child being aggrieved by the grant of interim maintenance by the Family Court at Rs. 15,000 per month.  The High Court had vide order dated April 22, 2021 enhanced the said maintenance amount and directed the father to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor, considering that his school fee itself was in that range. Observing that when the mother of the minor child obtained divorce by mutual consent, the maintenance was fixed in respect of the child at Rs. 5,000 per month, the Court said: "It goes without saying that the appellant being a minor, is not bound by that settlement, and he is entitled to claim maintenance for himself for his upbringing from the respondent i.e., his father." The appellant had contended that the father had not truly and correctly disclosed his income and that from his Income Tax Returns (ITRs) filed before the Court, it appeared that apart from agricultural income which was the only income claimed to have been earned by the father, he had been deriving rental income from a property, which was separate from the agricultural income. The counsel appearing for the minor child had vehemently challenged the averments made in the affidavit filed by the father thereby claiming that he had deliberately mis-stated facts before the Court. "Considering the fact that the present appeal is directed against the fixation of the interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 15,000/- per month, which we have raised to Rs. 25,000/- per month, and the appellant's petition is still pending consideration before the learned Family Court, we are inclined to relegate the parties to the learned Family Court to establish their respective claims/ defence before the learned Family Court, and to invite the final order from the learned Family Court," the Court said.  The Court therefore disposed of the appeal with a direction to the respondent father to continue to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor child till the disposal of the petition preferred by the child, or till further orders that the Family Court may pass.  "The right of the appellant to seek further enhancement, even at the interim stage, is preserved. No adjournments shall be sought by the parties, nor should either of the parties be granted any undue adjournments by the learned Family Court, and we request the learned Family Court to dispose of the petition pending before it under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 within the next one year," the Court added.  The Court said that all rights and contentions of the parties, including those raised in the appeal, were preserved and shall be examined by the Family Court. Title: FATEH SAHARAN v. ROHIT SAHARAN    
The Supreme Court observed that its jurisdiction under Section 25 of CPC cannot be extended to determine the question of territorial jurisdiction of the proceedings. The plea of jurisdiction or the lack of it can be prompted before the Court in which the proceedings are pending, Justice JK Maheshwari observed. In this case, Neilan International Co. Ltd. filed a transfer petition under Section 25 CPC, seeking the transfer of petition filed by Powerica Limited under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the LXXII Addl. City Civil and Sessions Judge (Commercial Court) at Bengaluru, Karnataka to the Bombay High Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction in Mumbai, Maharashtra, in light of Petitioner having filed Arbitration Petition before the Bombay High Court under Sections 47 and 48 of the Act for the enforcement of arbitral award passed by Arbitral Tribunal in ICC International Court of Arbitration Case No.19933/TO in London under the ICC Rules 2012.  According to the petitioner, Bangalore Principal City Civil Court as it has no jurisdiction to entertain an award passed in the International Commercial Arbitration. This petition was opposed by the respondent contending that the plea regarding the lack of jurisdiction of the Bengaluru Court to entertain the petition cannot be taken in a transfer petition. Reliance was placed on an order passed in 'Naivedya Associates v. Kirti Nutrients Limited' The bench therefore considered the primary issue whether the plea of territorial jurisdiction or the lack thereof can be entertained by this Court in its jurisdiction under Section 25 of CPC. "Apropos, it is no longer res integra that there is limited scope vested in this Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 25 of CPC and the same cannot be extended to determine the question of territorial jurisdiction of the proceedings before it as the plea of jurisdiction or the lack of it can be prompted before the Court in which the proceedings are pending.", the court observed while it dismissed the Transfer petition.

Holding that the prosecution could not prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday upheld the acquittal order passed by the trial court in a 42-year-old murder case (which took place in July 1980). The Bench of Justice Om Prakash-VII and Justice Narendra Kumar Johari was essentially dealing with a Government appeal filed against a 1985 jdgment and order passed by Special Judge (E.C. Act)/ Additional Sessions Judge, Jalaun at Orai by which the two accused were acquitted of the charges under Sections 302/34, 302 IPC. While accused respondent No.2 (Ramesh) died during the pendency of the appeal in the year 2021, the appeal against him was abated and thus, the appeal survived qua respondent no. 1 (Narendra Singh). The case in brief  As per the FIR lodged by the informant (brother of the deceased), he and his brother had gone to the Court on July 16, 1980, for taking a certified copy of a certain judgment. At about 02.00 - 02.15 p.m., when they were returning together from the District Court, the accused persons opened fire upon the deceased. It was alleged that the murder was committed by the accused persons, namely, Narendra Singh and Ramesh due to old enmity between the accused Narendra Singh and the informant. Having heard the counsel for the parties and going through the record, the trial court acquitted the accused person on the basis of the followings reasons: - PW-1 and PW-2 were not the eye account witnesses. They were present at the time of incident in the District Court premises and had received information about the incident there. - The Prosecution was not able to prove the place of incident and that It was a blind murder case.  - The PW-1 being the real brother of the deceased was an interested witness and PW-2 was a pocket witness of the police and he appeared as a witness in several cases initiated on behalf of the prosecution. Challenging their acquittals, the State Government preferred the instant appeal in the High Court. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court perused the statement of PW-2 made in the examination-in-chief and cross-examination and thereafter, noted that if both are taken together it was evident that PW-2 cannot be placed in the category of 'fully reliable witness', even though he was not declared as a hostile witness. The Court further noted that it had come on the record that PW-1 (informant) was also not present at the time of occurrence at the place of incident and that he had himself admitted in the examination-in-chief that when they were returning from the Court towards the market, deceased was not accompanying them. "Presence of this witness alongwith PW-1 and other witnesses disclosed in the F.I.R. at the time of incident was not found believable , which is based on correct appreciation of facts and evidence. The trial court while recording the aforesaid facts has discussed the entire evidence in detail and has rightly concluded that PW-1 and PW-2 were not present at the place of occurrence at the time of incident. They were planted later on by the police after due consultation," the court further added as it found justification in the acquittal order of the trial court. Consequently, considering the entire aspects of the matter, the court came to the conclusion that the judgment and order of the trial court was well thought out and well discussed and that it had rightly held that the prosecution had not succeeded to prove the guilt of the accused respondent beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the Government Appeal was dismissed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the trial court was affirmed. Case title - State of U.P. v. Narendra Singh [GOVERNMENT APPEAL No. - 1990 of 1985]   
The Supreme Court has held that a doctor's act of storing small quantities of medicines will not amount to an offence of unauthorized stocking of medicines under Section 18(c) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940. "When small quantity of medicine has been found in the premises of a registered medical practitioner, it would not amount to selling their medicines across the counter in an open shop", observed a bench comprising Justices Krishan Murari and Sudhanshu Dhulia while quashing the criminal proceedings against a Tamil Nadu-based doctor under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940.  The bench noted that the quantity of medicines which was allegedly seized from the premises of the petitioner was extremely small, a quantity which can be easily found in the house or a consultation room of a doctor.  The case in brief  The premises of appellant S. Athilakshmi, who is a registered medical practitioner carrying on her medical practice at premises in Chennai, was inspected in March 2016 by the Drugs Inspector, wherein a certain quantity of medicines, lotions, ointments, etc, were found.   Alleging that she stocked drugs for sale and sold the drugs without having a valid drug license, which is punishable under section 27(b)(ii) of the said Act, an application was moved by the inspector for obtaining a sanction for prosecution from the office of the Director of Drugs Control, Tamil Nadu.  The sanction was received in Jan 2018, after which, the Inspector filed a complaint before the Magistrate, Egmore, for prosecuting the Appellant under Section 18(c) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 punishable under Section 27(b)(ii) of the Act.    She challenged the proceedings before the Madras High Court, however, her plea filed under Section 482 CrPC was dismissed, prompting her to file the instant SLP before the Supreme Court.  Supreme Court’s observations  The top Court noted that the Madras High Court lost sight of the fact that the appellant was a registered medical practitioner and her area of specialization being dermatology, it was possible that she was distributing these drugs to her patients for emergency uses and thus, she is protected by the Act itself.   In this regard, the Court referred to Schedule (K) 7 appended to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, which exempts certain drugs from the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act (which includes both Section 18 and Section 27 referred above, which are penal provisions).  The Schedule serves as an exception in favour of the medical practitioner where the drugs given in Schedule ‘K’ would be exempted from the purview of Chapter 4 of the Act.  It may be noted that Entry No. 5 under Schedule (K), which was applicable to the facts of the instant case, states thus:  “Drugs supplied by a registered medical practitioner to his own patient or any drug specified in Schedule C supplied by a registered medical practitioner at the request of another such practitioner if it is specially prepared with reference to the condition and for the use of an individual patient provided the registered medical practitioner is not (a) keeping an open shop or (b) selling across the counter or (c) engaged in the importation, manufacture, distribution or sale of drugs in India to a degree which render him liable to the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act and the rules thereunder.”  Against this backdrop, observing that she was protected under Entry 5 to Schedule K, the Court observed that the quantity of medicines seized from the appellant was extremely small, a quantity which can be easily found in the house or a consultation room of a doctor. "The provisions of Section 18 and 27 are relevant provisions under the law, which have a social purpose, which is to protect ordinary citizens from being exploited inter alia, by unethical medical practitioners, and for this reason the punishment under Section 27 can extend up to 5 years under the law, and has a minimum punishment of 3 years. But given the facts and circumstances of the case and considering that the Appellant is a registered medical practitioner, along with the fact that the quantity of medicines which have been seized is extremely small, a quantity which can be easily found in the house or a consultation room of a doctor, in our considered view no offence is made out in the present case", the Court observed.  “ In fact, an exception has been created under Schedule ‘K’ read with Rule 123 to the rules, the appellant ought to have been given the benefit of these provisions and such a registered medical practitioner should not have been allowed to face a trial where in all likelihood the prosecution would have failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,” the Court further observed.  The Court further noted that the appellant had produced multiple invoices from pharmaceutical shops to show her bonafides and that drugs seized from her premises were admittedly of ‘standard quality’ which indicated that it was not a case where the Appellant was operating a shop to sell spurious medicines over the counter.  The Court also factored into account that no explanation was furnished in the instant case for a delay in getting the approval for prosecution.   “The sanction for prosecution given in the present case appears, prima facie, to suffer from the vice of non­application of mind. There is no reference to any of the documents, evidence or the submissions submitted by either of the parties, no reasons assigned or even an explanation pertaining to the delay which indicates it has been passed in a mechanical manner.”  The Court also found faults with the sanctioning authority for not examining whether a practicing doctor could be prosecuted under the facts of the case, considering the small quantity of the drugs and the exception created in favour of the medical practitioners under Rule 123, read with the Schedule ‘K’.  In view of this, the appeal was allowed and the order of the Madras High Court was set aside and the criminal proceedings on the file of X Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai were quashed.

By The Drugs Inspector [SLP (Criminal) No. 9978 of 2022] Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940- Supreme Court quashes criminal proceedings initiated against a doctor for stocking small quantities of medicine- Such stocking will not amount to the offence of unauthorized stocking of medicines as per Section 18(c)- When small quantity of medicine has been found in the premises of a registered medical practitioner, it would not amount to selling their medicines across the counter in an open shop -Para 9 Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940- Sections 18 and 27- The provisions of Section 18 and 27 are relevant provisions under the law, which have a social purpose, which is to protect ordinary citizens from being exploited inter alia, by unethical medical practitioners, and for this reason the punishment under Section 27 can extend up to 5 years under the law, and has a minimum punishment of 3 years.

While interpreting Section 37 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), the Calcutta High Court has recently opined that 'reasonable grounds' to believe that the accused has not committed an offence must be more than mere 'prima facie' grounds.

While interpreting Section 37 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), the Calcutta High Court has recently opined that 'reasonable grounds' to believe that the accused has not committed an offence must be more than mere 'prima facie' grounds.  Section 37 of the Act deals with classification of the offences contained within the Act and provides for cases where bail can be granted to the accused person. It provides dual conditions for bail in case of certain offences: one, prima facie opinion of the innocence of the accused and two, the accused will not commit a similar offense while on bail. Justice Bibhas Ranjan De observed,  "It is axiometic that 'reasonable grounds' means something more than prima facie grounds. It contemplates substantial probable causes for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence. It requires existence of such facts and circumstances as are sufficient to justify satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence. Section 37 of the NDPS Act mandates a more stricter approach than an application for bail sans the NDPS Act." The Court further noted that considering the seriousness of offence punishable under NDPS Act and in order to control the menace of drug trafficking, stringent parameters for grant of bail under the NDPS Act has been prescribed. "After careful scrutiny of section 37 of the NDPS Act 1985 we find that the exercise of power to grant bail is not only subject to the limitations contained in section 439 Cr.P.C, but is also subject to the limitations placed by section 37 which commences with non-obstante clause", the Court underscored further.  Enumerating further, the Court observed that  enlargement on bail of any person accused of commission of an offence under the NDPS Act must satisfy two conditions- First condition is that the persecution must be given an opportunity to oppose the application; and the second, is that the Court must be satisfied that there are 'reasonable grounds for believing' that he is not guilty of such offence. If either of these two conditions is not satisfied, rejection of bail is rule, the Court stated further.  Background  In the instant case, on April 7, 2021 one Sanjiv Kr. Intelligence Officer, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) attached to Kolkata Zonal Unit (KZU) had received information in relation to trafficking substantial quantity of "Ganja" by one Susanta Dey allies Ravi and Manik Chanrda Das with a car namely TATA ACE GOLD likely to be unloaded in the house of said Susanta Dey and then to supply to one Asim Mirdha. The said information was reduced into writing and after intimating superior Officer a team of NCB Officers led by Superintendent, NCB (KZU), reached near the vicinity of the house of Susanta Dey. At about 20.45 hours they found the said vehicle approaching the house of Susanta Dey. Thereafter two persons got down from the drivers cabin and started unloading nylon sacks. NCB team intervened and thereafter those two suspects disclosed their identity as Swapon Biswas and Susanta Dey. Subsequently, the NCB team reached the house of Manik Das (the petitioner) and Asim Mirdha. Though Manik Das was not found in his house but Asim Mirdha was found in the house and on being asked he disclosed that he was to procure the said Ganja through the arrangement made by Susanta Dey. Thereafter, he was also served with notice under section 67 of the NDPS Act and his statement was recorded. All seized articles were found to be Ganja by the examination report of chemical laboratory, Kolkata and the report was submitted before the  jurisdictional Court on June 25, 202. During investigation Asit Karmakar and Manik Das were arrested and their statements were recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act.  Observations  The Court observed that at the stage of consideration of bail, the Court does not have the power to evaluate evidence. Accordingly, the Court opined that in the instant case, the petitioner has failed to discharge his onus under Section 37 of the NDPS Act and accordingly remarked,  "It is for the petitioner to establish by cogent and unimpeachable evidence that he was not in conversation or contact with the arrested co- accused through the mobile phones which the NCB relies upon to claim nexus between the petitioner and the other co-accused and the conspiracy between them. Given the mandate of Section 37 of the NDPS Act in the facts of the present case, the petitioner has failed to discharge such onus." Furthermore, the Court dismissed the contention of the petitioner that pursuant to the Supreme Court judgment in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu the statement of co-accused under section 67 of the NDPS Act is of no value and that bail cannot be rejected on the basis of such a statement.  "Even if we ignore the statement of co-accused under section 67 of the NDPS Act in terms of ratio of the decision in Tofan Singh's case (supra) we are unable to ignore the call details report. At this stage while dealing with a bail application we cannot overlook the complicity of the petitioner in terms of section 10 of the Evidence Act", the Court elucidated further.  Accordingly, the Court refused to grant bail to the petitioner.  Case Title: Manik Das @Manik Chandra Das v.

The Telangana High Court has held that Beedi workers are "workmen" under Section 2(n) of Workmen's Compensation Act. Justice M. Laxman further held that rolling of Beedies is a "manufacturing process" and hence a Beedi roller is a workman under the Act.  Brief facts of the Case  The present Civil Miscellaneous Appeal assailed the order on the file of Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation and Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Karimnagar whereby the claim made by the appellant for compensation for death of his daughter Yeddandi Yellavva in the course of employment with the opposite party, while rolling the Beedies, was dismissed.  The impugned order showed that the Commissioner had framed the preliminary issue of maintainability as follows:  "Whether the workwoman employed in Beedi manufacturing process is covered under the purview of Workmen's Compensation Act or not."  The Commissioner held that the occupation of the deceased did not come under the purview of Workman under Section 2(n) of Workmen's Compensation Act and consequently the claim petition was dismissed.  Issue  Whether a 'Beedi Roller' is a workman within the definition of Section 2(n) of Workmen's Compensation Act?  Ruling of the Court  The contention of the counsel for the opposite party was that the orders passed by the Commissioner required no inference since there was no manufacturing process so as to construe the deceased as a workwoman.   Justice M. Laxman referred to Section 2(n)(ii) and Clause 2 of Schedule II of Workmen's Compensation Act as well as Section 2(k) of Factories Act to determine the issue of law.   The court held:   A glance at the definition of Clause 2(n) of the Workmen's Compensation Act shows that any person employed in any such capacity as is specified in Schedule-II, comes under the definition of Workman. Clause 2 of Schedule-II clearly shows that any person employed otherwise than in clerical capacity in any premises or within the precincts where the manufacturing process as defined under the Clause-k of Section 2 of Factories Act is coming under the definition of workman. The definition of 2(k) also makes it clear that the process of making any article or substance with a view to usage, sale, transport, delivery or disposal is constituted as manufacturing process.   On the basis of the aforementioned reading of the provisions, the court held that the rolling of Beedies is nothing but making of any article or substance with a view to usage or sale or transport. Therefore, the activity of the deceased being the Beedi roller, clearly falls within the definition of a workwoman.   The appeal was allowed and the matter was remanded to the Commissioner for disposal of claim on merits.   Case Title: Yeddandi Venkataiah v. M/s.Prabhudas Kishoredas Tobacco Products Ltd.

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to Kairana MLA Nahid Hasan in connection with a case of criminal intimidation. The Bench of Justice Samit Gopal denied him bail looking to his criminal history and the order-sheet of the trial court showing that he avoided appearing before the trial court. Essentially, an FIR was registered under Section 406, 504, 506, I.P.C against Hasan and one Nawab by one Shahjahan alleging therein that her husband had given a Bolero pick-up vehicle of which he was the registered owner on rent in the year 2015 to co-accused Nawab. Case in brief It was further alleged that Nawab did not pay the required monthly rent of the same and therefore, finally on 22.04.2019, when they came to know that the vehicle was standing in the premises of the applicant (Hasan), both the first informant and her husband went there to see the vehicle and that is when they got a phone call from the applicant (Hasan) who threatened them and told them to go back.  It was thier case that they were also abused and threatened for life and even threat was extended that they would be got involved in false cases. Her husband due to fear went to Police Station Kotwali after which the Inspector in-charge was sent to the place where the vehicle was standing and then again a threatening call was received and there were abuses received by the first informant and the threat of life was extended.  Hasan's counsel argued before the court that the incident is a petty offence and even otherwise as per the prosecution case, the vehicle was given on rent to coaccused Nawab. The applicant was not entrusted with the vehicle. On the other hand, the state argued that the applicant had been avoiding appearance in the Court in spite of service of summons and that there are good chances of him not co-operating with the trial in the instant case, and that he may abscond and tamper with evidence and threaten the witnesses in spite of the fact that he is a public representative Court's observations  After having heard the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, the Court observed that although as per the prosecution case, the vehicle in question was not given to the applicant by the first informant and her husband, but the said vehicle was recovered from the premises of the applicant.  Further, the Court noted that he has criminal history of 17 cases and as per the the order-sheet of the trial court, in spite of service of summons on 03.03.2021, the applicant kept on avoiding appearance before the trial court. It was only when he was arrested in another case he was then taken on remand in this case on 29.01.2022.  "In these circumstances, as of now, looking to the criminal history of the applicant and the order-sheet of the trial court which shows the absondence of the applicant and the apprehension of the applicant not co-operating in the trial and their being an apprehension of his tampering with evidence and threatening the witnesses, this Court is not inclined to release the applicant on bail. The applicant may renew his prayer of bail after the evidence of first informant and her husband has been recorded by the trial court in the present case," the Court observed as it denied him the benefit of bail. Case title - Nahid Hasan v. State of U.P. [CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 8054 of 2022]    
The Delhi High Court has observed that the FIR and chargesheet can be quashed if the allegations made in the FIR or complaint or the evidence collected, though remaining uncontroverted, do not disclose the commission of an offence.

The Delhi High Court has observed that the FIR and chargesheet can be quashed if the allegations made in the FIR or complaint or the evidence collected, though remaining uncontroverted, do not disclose the commission of an offence.  Justice Asha Menon was of the view that the the decision of the Court to exercise or not to exercise the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. would be predicated on the facts of each case, however, while considering the facts, the court cannot embark on an inquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR.  The Court was dealing with a plea seeking quashing of chargesheet dated 4th December, 2021 emanating from an FIR registered with the Crime Branch, Rohini on the basis of a complaint lodged by the respondent No.2 by way of an email addressed to the Commissioner of Police, Delhi. It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that that the entire case was a product of mala fide, falsehood and absurdity and this was a case of sheer abuse of the criminal process and was also covered by the judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Haryana and Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal. Therefore it was prayed that the Court ought to quash the chargesheet in accordance with the guidelines incorporated of the said judgment.  It was contended that property in question belonged to Mr. Sunil Datt and Mr. Ashok Kumar, whereas the complainant who had been divorced by Mr. Sunil Datt way back in 2000 was claiming a right to the ground floor.  It was claimed that the complainant could produce no document to reflect that she had been in possession of the ground floor for the last two years. Moreover, after the husband and wife had divorced, it could not be reasonably believed that 17 years later the respondent No.2 would have been given the keys of the ground floor by the ex-husband.  It was submitted that the aunt of Mr. Sunil Datt and Mr. Ashok Kumar, who were brothers, was living in the first floor of the same property and that there were some disputes inter se parties. The Court noted that the Apex Court in Bhajan Lal case distilled the principles governing the exercise of the extraordinary power of the court under Article 226.  "When seen on these touchstones, it is clear that the entire thrust of the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners is on the genuineness of the allegations made against the petitioners," the Court noted.  The Court was of the view that the submissions reflecting on the reliability of the statements of the respondent No.2 or the genuineness of her complaint cannot be subject matter of the proceedings and that the Court cannot weigh the material so as to determine the question of truth in the complaint.  "As observed in Bhajan Lal case (supra), it is when the allegations made in the FIR, if taken at face value alongwith other materials accompanying the FIR, do not disclose an offence, that the court would be justified in quashing the FIR. If the allegations made in the FIR or complaint or the evidence collected, though remaining uncontroverted, do not disclose the commission of an offence, then the FIR and charge-sheet could be quashed," the Court said.  It added that if the allegations in the FIR or complaint were inherently improbable, then the FIR and charge-sheet could be quashed, however, none of the situations prevailed in the matter.  "If these allegations were to be taken at face value or they were to be treated as uncontroverted, they disclose the commission of various offences by the accused persons including the petitioners in cohort with each other. None of these allegations appear to be absurd or inherently improbable," the Court said.  While the Court said that there was no ground to exercise those powers in the present case, it added that it would be open for the accused petitioners, to make their submissions on the material placed before the Trial Court to seek discharge, if at all no offence was made out against them. "In the light of these discussions, no merit is found in the petition which is dismissed in limine," the Court concluded.  Title: MR. ABHISHEK GUPTA & ANR. v. STATE OF NCT OF DELHI & ANR    
The Delhi High Court has said that sick or infirm persons need not satisfy the twin conditions for the grant of bail under Section 45(1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The twin conditions are that when an accused applies for bail under PMLA, the public prosecutor has to be given an opportunity to oppose the same and if the court is considering grant of bail, there must be reasonable grounds for it to believe that the person is not guilty and is unlikely to commit any offence while on bail. However, a proviso to the provision states that a person who is sick or infirm may be released on bail. After perusing the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the PMLA, Justice Jasmeet Singh in an order on a bail application said the inclusion of the proviso for grant of bail shows the legislative intent to incorporate relaxations for persons below 16 years of age; a woman or those who are sick and infirm. The court also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in Gautam Kundu v. Directorate of Enforcement wherein it has been emphasised that the legislature has carved out the exception for these categories. "Thus, the proviso to Section 45(1) of PMLA carves out an exception from the rigours of Section 45 for persons who are sick or infirm. Once a person falls within the proviso of Section 45(1), he need not satisfy the twin conditions under section 45(1) as elucidated in the dicta of Gautam Kundu (supra)," said Justice Singh. The Enforcement Directorate had earlier argued that the test required is whether the applicant in custody suffers from a condition which cannot be addressed from the jail. Justice Singh made the observations while granting bail to one Devki Nandan Garg in the money laundering case registered by the ED in connection with Shakti Bhog loan fraud case. Garg has been suffering from multiple ailments since 2001, his bail plea said. In December 2020, CBI had registered an FIR against Shakti Bhog Foods Limited under Section 120B, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 along with section 13(2), 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 after receiving a complaint from the State Bank of India. Since the offences were scheduled offences under PMLA, a money laundering case was registered in January 2021.  ED's investigation revealed that Garg allegedly fabricated transport bills and used fake PAN account details in the fake invoices provided by him by Shakti Bhog Foods Limited through various shell companies. Garg is alleged to have been actively involved in rotation and layering of bank funds in dummy entities.  According to the ED, Garg acquired 'proceeds of crime' of Rs.15.76 Crores for fake bills worth Rs.1576 Crores as commission. As per the agency, the said funds were proceeds of crime under Section 2 (u) of the PMLA.  Senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Garg, argued that he was entitled for bail as he was covered within the definition of sick and infirm person under proviso to Section 45(1) of the PMLA.  The court was apprised that Garg has one kidney, which is also non-functional, and the other one is impaired; has serious heart condition and had also undergone various surgeries. It was also stated that he was suffering from spondylitis, vertigo, syphilis and also contracted COVID-19 earlier this year while he was in judicial custody.  The ED argued the medical conditions of Garg are "historical" as he has been suffering from them since 2001.  "Even during the period of alleged offences i.e., from the year 2007 to 2012, the applicant was suffering from these ailments," the central agency counsel told the court, adding he was getting proper and satisfactory medical facilities in the jail.  Perusing the medical reports, Justice Singh said there is no doubt that Garg is sick and infirm. The court added that some of the medical conditions are serious and life threatening. Noting that 'sick' and 'infirm' are not defined under PMLA, the court relied upon the dictionary meaning of the words. "He is functioning on 30% capacity of one kidney and the other kidney is dead. He requires constant monitoring otherwise his fluctuations can cause death. He has undergone multiple surgeries for removal of his large intestine, gall bladder, peptic ulcer, colostomy and even a hernia operation. He has a pacemaker installed due to his heart condition and is also suffering from Spondylitis and Vertigo. During his period in jail, the applicant contracted Syphilis on 27.10.2021 and Covid-19 on 17.01.2022," said the court. Dealing with ED's argument on whether Garg suffered from a condition which could not be addressed from the jail, the court said there cannot be a squabble with the proposition that the accused is entitled to proper and adequate medical attention and assistance.  While prisons provide medical facilities, the services are not comparable to or equivalent to the level of treatment and care one can avail from private hospitals, said the court. "The facilities in the jail are of a general nature and character which is inadequate to monitor proper health of the applicant who is suffering from multiple serious ailments. The jail is not equipped to provide special and intensive treatment and care that the applicant is in need of," it added.  The court further said that Garg's condition is such that he requires emergent medical assistance which could not be provided in jail in a prompt and efficient manner vis-à-à-vis hospital atmosphere.  "Syphilis is a bacterial infection which can remain inactive in the body for decades before becoming active again. If untreated, syphilis can severely damage the heart, brain or other organs, and can be life threatening. The risk of kidney failure is high and can be triggered by the slightest of infection. The applicant needs constant daily monitoring to check that the parameters of 30% kidney function do not collapse," the court said.  Rejecting the argument on the ailments being "historical" in nature, the court said ailments aggravate with age.  "I have already discussed that ailments which, coupled with old age brings the applicant within the purview of "Infirm Person". The level of care, attention, minute to minute monitoring, emergent response which the applicant can get from a hospital cannot be provided at the jail," said the court. Title: DEVKI NANDAN GARG v. DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT    
Dismissing the criminal revision plea of a convict who hit a bike in a rash and negligent manner thereby causing the death of two persons, the Madhya Pradesh High Court last week noted that the court should not award a flea-bite sentence for offence under Section 304-A of IPC by showing undue sympathy.Section 304-A Indian Penal Code deals with Causing death by negligence [Whoever causes the... Dismissing the criminal revision plea of a convict who hit a bike in a rash and negligent manner thereby causing the death of two persons, the Madhya Pradesh High Court last week noted that the court should not award a flea-bite sentence for offence under Section 304-A of IPC by showing undue sympathy. Section 304-A Indian Penal Code deals with Causing death by negligence [Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both] This assertion came from the bench of Justice G. S. Ahluwalia that observed that the convict wasn't even eligible for a reduction of the jail sentence as two persons lost their lives due to the applicant/convict, who was solely negligent in causing the accident by hitting the motorcycle by coming from the wrong direction. The background of the case The Court was dealing with a Criminal Revision filed against the judgment and sentence dated September 15, 2021, passed by First Additional Sessions Judge, Ganjbasoda, Link Court Kurvai, District Vidisha, affirming the judgment and sentence, by which the applicant had been convicted for 279, 338 and 304-A of IPC. It was submitted by the counsel for the applicant that four persons, i.e. two males and one woman were riding on a motorcycle along with a minor girl and thus, it was clear that they themselves were negligent as only two persons can ride on a motorcycle.  It was further submitted that in fact, no accident had taken place from the motorcycle of the applicant and since the driver of the motorcycle could not control the motorcycle, therefore, it slipped, and as a result, two persons riding on the said motorcycle died on the spot. Court's observations  Perusing the post mortem report, the Bench observed that the deceased (Priti and Chandrashekhar) had sustained multiple external and internal injuries including multiple fractures, as a result, they died on the spot, and that the death of both persons was accidental in nature. Further, taking into account the spot map prepared by the police, the Court concluded that the accident took place on the extreme side of the road, and thus, the Court held thus: "...the evidence of the witnesses that the deceased was driving the vehicle on the extreme left side, whereas the applicant hit the motorcycle by coming from the wrong side appears to be correct." The Court further noted that according to the applicant himself, the deceased persons were on their left side and since the accident took place on the extreme left side of the road, therefore, the Court concluded as follows : "...it is clear that the applicant was driving the motorcycle in a wrong direction and hit the motorcycle of the deceased Chandrashekhar, while they were on the extreme left side of the road. Thus, it is the applicant who was at fault. Merely because three male persons and one minor girl were riding on the motorcycle, would not give any authority to the applicant to hit the said motorcycle by coming from the wrong direction." Concludingly, the Court opined that it was the applicant himself, who was driving the offending vehicle and by coming from the wrong side, hit the motorcycle of the deceased, resulting in the death of two persons.  As the findings of facts recorded by the Courts below cannot be said to be perverse or contrary to the record, accordingly, the Court upheld the conviction of the applicant for the offences under Sections 279, 338, and 304-A of IPC.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Gwalior Bench recently held that a Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) cannot be treated as an undertrial prisoner as contemplated under Section 436-A CrPC, since arrest/ confinement/ apprehension are not contemplated in Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Gwalior Bench recently held that a Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) cannot be treated as an undertrial prisoner as contemplated under Section 436-A CrPC, since arrest/ confinement/ apprehension are not contemplated in Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.  Justice Anand Pathak was essentially dealing with a criminal revision preferred by a CCL, challenging the order passed by the lower court, whereby his appeal was dismissed and the order passed by the Juvenile Justice Board was affirmed.  As per the case diary, the CCL, aged 14, was facing allegations of committing rape upon a 3-year-old girl. Moreover, the medical reports of the victim supported the allegations levelled against him. He was in correction home/remand and was facing proceedings before the JJB for offences punishable under Section 376 IPC and under Section 5, 6 POCSO Act.  The CCL prayed for his release citing the period of retention in remand/correction home. He also raised the legal question that as per the provision under Section 436-A CRPC, he had suffered more than two years of incarceration, and therefore, he ought to be released on bail because maximum retention/detention for CCL in remand home can only be three years. He argued that since he had completed more than half of the period of detention, his case for bail had merit.  Taking note of the pleadings of the CCL, the Court framed the following questions for its consideration-  "1. Whether a child in conflict with law completes more than one half of total period of retention of three years in special home, then whether he is entitled to avail the benefit of Section 436-A of Cr.P.C.?   2. Whether a child in conflict with law can be treated as under trial prisoner as contemplated under Section 436-A of Cr.P.C.?   3. Any additional submission related to this question can also be addressed by the learned amici curiae in the matter."   The CCL submitted that the Act of 2015 is a beneficial and benevolent legislation, and therefore, is to be construed to have incorporated the provisions impliedly. Building on this argument, he submitted that the application under Section 436-A CrPC is one such clause which offers the welfare of CCL and helps to achieve the general objective of the Act of 2015, and that the same does not exclude CrPC in expressed terms. Therefore, he submitted that relevant provisions such as Section 436-A CrPC could be borrowed here for the benefit of CCL.  Mr. V.D. Sharma, the Amicus Curiae, submitted that on a careful reading of Section 1(4) of the Act, 2015 and Section 5 CrPC, it is clear that the former would prevail over the latter. He placed his reliance on the decision of a division bench of the Court in Ankesh Gurjar @ Ankit Gurjar v. The State of M.P, wherein it was concluded that Section 12 of the Act of 2015 is a complete code in itself qua the subject of bail. Therefore, he asserted that general provisions as to Bail and Bond as referred under Section 436-A CrPC has no applicability in relation to the bail of Juvenile. Thus, according to him, Section 436-A CrPC cannot be attracted in any case, relating to Juveniles.  Addressing the point regarding the Act of 2015 being a beneficial legislation, he submitted that it is specifically meant to deal with all matters relating to Children and that vide Section 3 of the Act of 2015, the legislature had intended to provide certain principles which are to be followed while implementing the provisions of the Act of 2015. He further submitted that on a conjoint reading of Section 3(xii) with Section 12, coupled with Rule-8 of the 2016 Rules of the Act of 2015, it can be understood that apprehension/detention of the child is an exception and should be a matter of last resort and that too by recording reasons for doing the same. Therefore, Mr. V.D. Sharma submitted that that the purview of CrPC has been taken away from the Act of 2015.   Mr. S.K. Sharma, another Amicus Curiae appointed by the Court, came up with a different point of view. Elucidating the historical background of Section 436-A CrPC, he submitted that the said provision came into force by way of Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005, whereas, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (Predecessor of Act of 2015) is prior in time. Therefore, he argued that the non obstante clause of Section 1(4) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 (predecessor of the Act of 2015) did not have any occasion to consider Section 436-A CrPC.  He further submitted that since the concept of Section 436-A CrPC originated from different judgments of the Apex Court and was based on Article 21 of the Constitution of India, therefore, even if there was a bar, existing impliedly under Section 1(4) Act of 2015, the same cannot hold good. He asserted that as per the provisions of the Act of 2015, certain presumptions have been raised in favour of juvenile in which presumption of innocence is one of the attributes and the same was applicable in the present case. He argued that since remand home also confines and restrains the activities of a juvenile, therefore, in fact his confinement deserves to be addressed under Section 436-A CtPC. Supporting the case of the CCL, he submitted that considering the period of his retention, he be considered for release on adequate surety.  The Court began with its observations by interpreting the relevant provisions under the Act of 2015 and the CrPC. Corollary to it, the Court noted that the primary purpose of the Act of 2015 is to reform or a repatriate the child in to society and not of deterrence or retributive qua child-  For this reason even when the child is assessed to be tried as an adult is not jointly tried with the adult co-accused (Section 23 of the Act of 2015) nor is tried by the regular Courts of law but by Children Courts as per Sections 15 and 19, so that child friendly atmosphere may prevail in that Children's Court.  The Court then examined the conflicting provisions under the Act of 2015 and CRPC, in the context of its observations in the Ankesh Gujar case-  Perusal of Section 1 (4) although gives an impression that apprehension, detention or imprisonment etc. are contemplated by the legislature while enactment, but when it is tested on the anvil of Section 12 of the Act of 2015 vis-a-vis provisions of Cr.P.C., then Division Bench of this Court ironed out the creases in the case of Ankesh Gurjar (supra) and held that concept of arrest / apprehension in a police lock-up / jail as contemplated in Chapter V of Cr.P.C. is not recognized in the Scheme of Act of 2015. Therefore, juvenile is not lodged in any police lock-up and jail, therefore, benefit of anticipatory bail is not available to him in Act of 2015.   The Court elucidated that the very concept of "Apprehension or Arrest" has been negatived by its decision in the Ankesh Gujar case and therefore, as per the legal mandate, a juvenile is never under confinement by way of arrest (pre or post trial), and when he is not arrested under the Act of 2015, then Section 436-A CrPC does not come in to play. It opined that words, such as Investigation, Inquiry or Trial as contemplated in CrPC are not borrowed in letter and spirit in Act of 2015.  Coming to the provision under Section 436-A CrPC, the Court noted-  Although Section 436-A of Cr.P.C. Contemplates maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence under that law. Here expression, under that law can only mean either Indian Penal Code (because of Section 376 of IPC, Juvenile is facing) or POCSO (Section 5/6 of POCSO Act), not the Act of 2015.   With the said observation, the court scrutinised the Act of 2015 and noted that the statute is for the welfare of children and is guided by the said spirit and objects, and that it does not contemplates imprisonment as a way of punishment or as a way of retribution to the crime allegedly committed by a CCL. Therefore, the argument of the CCL regarding Section 436-A doesn't hold ground and that the said provision is not applicable in the factual matrix of his case-  When relevant Law itself desist from imprisonment or arrest then the theory of suffering more than half of the maximum period of imprisonment gets frustrated. In short, Section 436-A of Cr.P.C. itself does not support the arguments advanced by petitioner.   If the controversy is seen from the vantage point of judgment delivered by Division Bench of this Court in the case of Ankesh Gurjar (supra) then also it is legally established that CICL can never be arrested or apprehended and therefore, valuable right of anticipatory bail is not even contemplated in the Act of 2015. Thus, provisions of Section 436-A of Cr.P.C. is not applicable in the present set of facts.  After the abovementioned conclusion, the Court noted that considering the allegations levelled against him and the medical reports of the victim, his case for release lacked merits at the current stage.   Collating its aforesaid analysis and observations, the Court dismissed the Criminal Revision, holding that a CICL cannot be treated as an undertrial prisoner as contemplated under Section 436-A CrPC-  In view of the discussion made about, questions as formulated above deserve to be answered in negative and child in conflict with law can not be treated as under trial prisoner as contemplated under Section 436-A of Cr.P.C. and cannot be released after completing half of total period of detention of three years in special home to avail the benefit of Section 436-A of Cr.P.C.  Case Title: Vidhi ka Ulaghan Karne Wala Balak Versus State of M.P. & Anr.                                  
The Punjab And Haryana High Court last week granted protection to a Muslim Girl (16 Year Old) who married a Muslim boy (21 year old) while noting that she is of Marriageable Age under Muslim Personal Law. Essentially, the Bench of Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi was hearing a protection plea filed by the couple (both Muslims) who solemnized their marriage as per Muslim rites and ceremonies. The couple contended before the Court that in Muslim law, puberty and majority are one and the same and that there is a presumption that a person attains majority at the age of 15 years.  It is further submitted that a Muslim boy or Muslim girl who has attained puberty is at liberty to marry anyone he or she likes and the guardian has no right to interfere.  The counsel for the petitioners cited various rulings of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in this regard including the ruling in the case of Yunus Khan vs. State of Haryana & Ors.' [2014(3) RCR (Criminal) 518. It was their further plea that their life and liberty is in grave danger at the hands of respondents Nos.5 to 7 and even though they moved a representation to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Pathankot, however, no action has been taken thereon.  The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they would be satisfied at this stage if directions are issued for deciding the said representation in a time-bound manner in accordance with the law. At the outset, the Court observed that in the case of Yunus Khan case, it was noted by the Court that the marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the personal law of the Muslims. "The law, as laid down in various judgments cited above, is clear that the marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the Muslim Personal Law. As per Article 195 from the book 'Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla', petitioner No.2 being over 16 years of age was competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice. Petitioner No.1 is stated to be more than 21 years of age. Thus, both the petitioners are of marriageable age as envisaged by Muslim Personal Law.It may be noted that as per Article 195 from the book 'Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla', Every Mahomedan of sound mind, who has attained puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage, and Puberty is presumed, in the absence of evidence, on completion of the age of fifteen years. In this regard, the Court further noted, "The Court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the apprehension of the petitioners needs to be addressed. Merely because the petitioners have got married against the wishes of their family members, they cannot possibly be deprived of the fundamental rights as envisaged in the Constitution of India." Thus, in view of the above discussion, the petition was disposed of with a direction to the respondent No.2- Senior Superintendent of Police, Pathankot, to decide the representation of the petitioners and take the necessary action as per law. In India, the legal age of marriage is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. This is governed by the Special Marriage Act, of 1954, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006. However, under Muslim law, marriage or Nikah is a contract. The Muslim law recognizes- the right of adults to marry by their own free will. The conditions for a valid Muslim marriage are: Both the individuals must profess Islam;Both should be of the age of puberty;There has to be an offer and acceptance and two witnesses must be present;Dower and Mehar; andAbsence of a prohibited degree of relationship. It is equally important to note that in the Hadiya Case (Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M. and ors.), the Supreme Court had observed that the Legitimacy Of an adult woman's choice of marriage can't be questioned. On December 15, 2021, the Union Cabinet cleared the proposal to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. This move would bring the legal age of marriage for women at par with men which is 21 years. The Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani introduced in the Lok Sabha the "Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021", which seeks to increase the age of marriage for women to 21 years across all religions.

The Jharkhand High Court last week took suo moto cognizance of an e-mail complaining about the negligent attitude adopted by the MGM Hospital, Jamshedpur as it alleged that a lady with 90% burn injury was left half-naked and without any proper medical facilities.  Appearing before the Bench of Chief Justice Dr. Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad the sender of the Mail, Advocate Anup Agarwal informed the Court that the lady had died of burn injury and that that the lady was not kept in the burn ward and initially, she was simply kept on a bed.  Submissions made before the Court  Advocate Agarwal further sent some photographs of the lady, wherein, in one of the photographs, she was sitting on the floor beside the bed.   Advocate Agarwal also submitted that since she was not given immediate treatment by admitting to the burn ward and which caused the loss of her life.  Further, appearing before the Court, AAG-II informed that there were 20 seats in the burn ward and 24 patients were there and no seat was vacant and, therefore, she was kept in the emergency ward.  Court's observations  Observing that MGM authorities do not have any element of compassion, the Court remarked,  "They are not able to take a decision as to who should be treated first in certain circumstances and they are utilizing dilly-dallying tactics in the treatment. However, this is our prima facie observation as we are not at all satisfied with the information given by the MGM Hospital to the leaned Addl. Advocate General."  Significantly, the Court also noted,  "This untoward and unfortunate incident has given rise to several questions regarding the attitude of the Management of the Hospital, the facilities which are to be provided either by the State or by any competent authority to such Hospitals and perhaps it also shows lack of training to the concerned doctors and staffs in dealing with the situation as in no case a lady with 90% burn injury can be kept like that which is revealed from the photographs sent by Mr. Agarwal."  Directions given by the Court  The Court directed the Member Secretary, JHALSA to make an inquiry in the matter and submit a report to the Court within a period of one week.   Apart from that, the State has also been asked to file a counter affidavit answering the issues.  The Court has also asked the State Government as to whether when the lady came to the Hospital with more than 90% burn injury, immediately any information was given to the police and whether the police has immediately lodged First Information Report?  The Court directed the Hospital Management and the State Authorities to fully cooperate with the Member Secretary, JHALSA during the inquiry and the entire expenditure would have to be incurred by the State Authority.  The matter was thus posted for further hearing on Thursday (25th February).  Case title - Court On Its Own Motion vs The State Of Jharkhand   Read Order

In a significant order, the Allahabad High Court has quashed the orders of the Uttar Pradesh Government recognizing or acknowledging 17 Other Backward Classes sub-castes as Scheduled Castes. The Court said that this exercise could have been undertaken only by way of parliamentary law. "The provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution do not leave any scope for including any Caste or Group to the list of Scheduled Caste in a State provided by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, except by law made by Parliament," the Bench of Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice J. J. Munir held. The castes which the UP government had intended to include in the SC category were - Majhwar, Kahar, Kashyap, Kevat, Mallah, Nishad, Kumhar, Prajapati, Dheevar, Bind, Bhar, Rajbhar, Dhiman, Batham, Turha, Godia, Manjhi and Machua. The case before the Court Essentially, the bench was dealing with a writ plea filed by Dr. B.R. Ambedker Granthalaya Evam Jan Kalyan Samiti, Gorakhpur challenging two Government Orders issued in 2016 [21st December and 22nd December], whereby members of certain 'Other Backward Castes' were sought to be declared as Scheduled Castes. The petitioner had argued that only the Parliament of the country has the right to include any caste in the SC list as per the provision under Article 341 of the Constitution. Additionally, another writ plea was moved by one Gorakh Prasad, challenging the subsequent Government Order issued by the State in 2019 [June 24] to the same effect. It was argued on behalf of the petitioners that the list of Scheduled Castes was prepared by the President of India and only the Parliament has the right to make any changes to the same and that the states have no right to amend it in any way. Court's observations As far as the order dated 21st December 2016 was concerned, the Court noted that it did not add or introduce any caste as a Scheduled Caste to the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 issued by the President of India in the exercise of powers under Article 341 of the Constitution.  The Court observed that the 21st December order only says that the members of the Caste Majhwar, whose Entry Number is 53 in the Scheduled Castes Order should be issued the necessary certificates after verification of their status, therefore, the Court did not find any illegality with that order. However, with regard to the 22nd December order, the Court observed that it clearly recognized 17 Other Backward Classes as Scheduled Castes in the name of clarification.  The Court emphasized that the order of the UP Govt recognizing 17 Castes, that were otherwise in the category of O.B.C., as Scheduled Castes in the State of Uttar Pradesh was not proper as it is impermissible for a state government to undertake such an exercise in view of the provisions of Article 341 of the Constitution. "The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 alone can specify which castes, races or tribes or groups within castes, races or tribes, shall be regarded as Scheduled Castes under the Constitution, in relation to a particular State or a Union Territory. The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order has to be made by the President of India. Under Article 341(2), any change to the list of Scheduled Castes specified in the President's order can only be made by Parliament by law. A parliamentary law alone can include in or exclude from the list of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, as amended in 1976, a particular caste. The order to be made by the President, which has been described under Article 341 as a notification is insulated from any kind of variation by a subsequent notification, even by the President. The only variation that can be done is by a parliamentary enactment, not otherwise," the Court held. The Court also relied upon the Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of STATE OF MAHARASHTRA vs. KESHAO VISHWANATH SONONE [CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4096 of 2020], wherein it was held that the power to include or exclude, amend or alter the Presidential Order is expressly and exclusively conferred on and vested with the Parliament and Courts cannot and should not extend jurisdiction to deal with the question as to whether a particular caste or sub-caste or group or part of a tribe is included in any one of the entries mentioned in the Presidential Order. In this view of the matter, the orders dated December 22, 2016, and June 24, 2019, were quashed and the writ petition was allowed. Case title - Dr. B.R. Ambedker Granthalaya Evam Jan Kalyan v. State of U.P. and others [PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION (PIL) No. - 2129 of 2017]    
The Court found that the Rehabilitation Centre has the necessary infrastructure.The Madras High Court, on Wednesday, dismissed a Public Interest Litigation filed by one Viswanathan against the Tamil Nadu Government's decision to shift 1000 crocodiles from Madras Crocodile Bank Trust to Greens Zoological Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre (GZRRC) in Gujarat. The petitioner had challenged the decision on the ground that 1000 crocodiles were being shifted to a facility... The Madras High Court, on Wednesday, dismissed a Public Interest Litigation filed by one Viswanathan against the Tamil Nadu Government's decision to shift 1000 crocodiles from Madras Crocodile Bank Trust to Greens Zoological Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre (GZRRC) in Gujarat.  The petitioner had challenged the decision on the ground that 1000 crocodiles were being shifted to a facility where only 56 crocodiles could be kept. He had also challenged grant of permission for operating the mini zoo stating that the same was in violation of provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972, and the Recognition of Zoo Rules, 2009. He also submitted that the Zoo was allowed to operate a Rescue and Re-habitation Center within the Zoo, which is a violation of Rule 2(j) of the Recognition of Zoo Rules 2009. He thus sought for quashing the order challenging the same to be illegal. He had also sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Crime Branch- Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) or a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the issue. The bench of Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice N Mala dismissed the PIL after considering the fact that the Rehabilitation Centre had the necessary infrastructure. The court pointed out that even experts were satisfied with respect to the infrastructure available at the facility and thus the court did not find any ground to interfere with the decision. There was also photographic evidence that shows the infrastructure available in the facility. The court also took into consideration the submission made by the Madras Crocodile Bank where they had conceded that they did not have the necessary financial backing to take proper care of the increasing number of crocodiles and vouched for the state of art infrastructure available at the Gujarat facility.  We are therefore of the opinion that the objections of the petitioner to the transfer of the 1000 crocodiles from the 4th respondent to the 3rd respondent rescue centre is devoid of merits and without any factual basis and as such rejected as untenable The court noted that Wild animals were not the property of the State or Central government or any organisation or individuals. They are the wealth of the nation and no one could claim ownership over them. Taking an eco-centric approach, the court observed that it had a duty to protect both humans and non-humans. Authoring the judgment, Justice Mala observed as under Our nation culturally has always been Ecocentric. We believe in peaceful co-existence with all creatures and our love and reverence for the animal world is reflected in our religion, folklore, art and craft. From ancient times we are known to have protected, venerated and conserved wild life. The legacy of protection of wild animals and plants is reflected in the constitution 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 by which Article 51-A was inserted in Part IV-A of the constitution. The court also noted that the Supreme Court in Centre for Environmental Law, World Wide Fund-India Vs.Union of India had held that the approach to such issues should be Ecocentric and not Anthropocentric. The Court has held that egocentric is life centered, nature centered where nature includes both human and non-humans. Anthropocentric on the other hand is always human interest focused. The rescue and rehabilitation of the crocodiles in issue have to be viewed from Ecocentric angle. The court further highlighted that the Parliament did not intend to curtain the operation of Zoos by private firms. In fact, the National Zoo Policy of 1998, calls for synergy between various government agencies, non-government agencies and people at large for achieving the objectives of the Act.  The court also disagreed with the contention of the Petitioner and held that a rescue centre is covered by the definition of zoo under sec 2 (39)of the Wild Life Act.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that a Magistrate can take cognizance of the complaint or application filed by the aggrieved person and issue notice to the respondent under Section 12 of the D.V. Act even in the absence of a Domestic Incident Report (DIR). The bench of Justice Rajeev Singh referred to the recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Prabha Tyagi vs Kamlesh Devi  (SC) 474, wherein it was held that Section 12 of the DV Act does not make it mandatory for a Magistrate to consider a Domestic Incident Report filed by a Protection Officer or service provider before passing any order under the D.V. Act. In essence, the Apex Court had in Prabha Tyagi (Supra) clarified that even in the absence of a Domestic Incident Report, a Magistrate is empowered to pass both ex parte or interim as well as a final order under the provisions of the D.V. Act. Read more about the Apex Court's ruling here: Domestic Violence Victim Can Enforce Her Right To Reside In 'Shared Household' Even If She Has Not Actually Lived There: Supreme Court What is a Domestic Incident Report? Before we move ahead to understand what the court held in this case, let us first understand what does a Domestic Incident Report (DIR) mean? A Domestic Incident Report is a report made in the prescribed form on receipt of a complaint of domestic violence from an aggrieved person. It may be noted that as per Section 12 of the DV Act, an aggrieved person or a Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person including the service provider may present an application to the Magistrate seeking one or more 58 reliefs under the D.V. Act.  Further, the proviso to Sub-Section (1) of Section 12 states that before passing any order on such an application, the Magistrate shall take into consideration any Domestic Incident Report received by him from the Protection Officer or the service provider Now, it must be understood that such a report comes into the picture only when a Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person including the service provider presents an application to the Magistrate.  But what happens when an aggrieved person herself approaches a magistrate u/s 12 of DV Act and does not approach the magistrate through the Protection Officer or a service provider? Now, in such a case, naturally, there wouldn't be any Domestic Incident Report (DIR) in existence. In such a situation, can it be said that in the absence of a Domestic Incident Report, the Magistrate cannot pass any order under the D.V. Act particularly when an application is filed before the Magistrate by the aggrieved person by herself or through a legal counsel? The Apex Court in the case of Prabha Tyagi vs Kamlesh Devi  (SC) 474 observed that although, the expression 'shall' is used in the proviso to Section 12 of DV Act, it is restricted to only those cases where a Protection Officer files any Domestic Incident Report or, as the case may be, the service provider files such a report.  "When a Domestic Incident Report is filed by a Protection Officer or a service provider, in such a case the Magistrate has to take into consideration the said report received by him. But if such a report has not been filed on behalf of the aggrieved person then he is not bound to consider any such report. Therefore, the expression 'shall' has to be read in the context of a Domestic Incident Report received by a Magistrate from the Protection Officer or the service provider as the case may be in which case, it is mandatory for the Magistrate to consider the report. But, if no such report is received by the Magistrate then the Magistrate is naturally not to consider any such Domestic Incident Report before passing any order on the application," the Court had held. The case before the High Court A complaint under Section 12 of the Act, 2005 was filed on 25th January 2022 by the aggrieved person herself, on which, the court concerned called for the DIR from the Protection Officer and fixed the matter for 3rd March, 2022.  Now, on March 3, since the report was not made available, another application was moved by the applicants with the prayer to proceed in the matter and issue notice to the private respondents, but the court below rejected the said applicant and called for the DIR. Now, against that very order, the aggrieved person moved the High Court. Allowing the plea, the High Court set aside the impugned order. The Court below was directed to proceed in the matter and conclude the same expeditiously, strictly in accordance with law and the principle laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Prabha Tyagi (supra), without giving any unnecessary adjournments to either of the parties.

The Supreme Court observed that the Wakf Board can determine the nature of the property as wakf only after conducting inquiry as prescribed under Section 40 of the Wakf Act. The conduct of inquiry pre-supposes compliance of the principles of natural justice so as to give opportunity of hearing to the affected parties, the bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian said. The court allowed an appeal filed by the State challenging the action of Wakf Board and measuring 1654 acres and 32 guntas as wakf property and held that the said land vest with the state and/or Corporation free from any encumbrance.  One of the issues that was considered was whether the power to investigate and determine the nature of property is an administrative function or is it a quasi-judicial function as an inquiry is required to be conducted before any property is declared to be Wakf property? At the outset, the court noted that the Board is competent to collect information regarding any property which it has reason to believe to be Wakf property and if any question arises as to whether a particular property is a Wakf property or not, or whether a wakf is a sunni wakf or a shia wakf, it may, after making such inquiry as it may deem fit, decide the question. Referring to the provisions of the Act, the court found that the power of the Board to investigate and determine the nature and extent of Wakf is not purely an administrative function. The bench observed thus:  "145... Such power has to be read along with Section 40 of the Act which enjoins "a Wakf Board to collect information regarding any property which it has reason to believe to be wakf property and to decide the question about the nature of the property after making such inquiry as it may deem fit." The power to determine under Section 32(2)(n) is the source of power but the manner of exercising that power is contemplated under Section 40 of the 1995 Act. An inquiry is required to be conducted if a Board on the basis of information collected finds that the property in question is a wakf property. An order passed thereon is subject to appeal before the Wakf Tribunal, after an inquiry required is conducted in terms of subsection (1) of Section 40. Therefore, there cannot be any unilateral decision without recording any reason that how and why the property is included as a wakf property. The finding of the Wakf Board is final, subject to the right of appeal under sub-section (2). Thus, any decision of the Board is required to be as a reasoned order which could be tested in appeal before the Wakf Tribunal." "146...Therefore, the Wakf Board has power to determine the nature of the property as wakf under Section 32(2)(n) but after complying with the procedure prescribed as contained in 120 Section 40. Such procedure categorically prescribes an inquiry to be conducted. The conduct of inquiry pre-supposes compliance of the principles of natural justice so as to give opportunity of hearing to the affected parties. " The court noted that the proceedings produced by the Wakf Board do not show any inquiry conducted or any notice issued to either of the affected parties. "Since there is no determination of the fact whether the property in question is a wakf property after conducting an inquiry in terms of Section 40(1) of the 1995 Act, the Errata notification cannot be deemed to be issued in terms of Section 32 read with Section 40 of the 1995 Act. Such determination alone could have conferred right on the affected parties to avail the remedy of appeal under Section 40 of the 1995 Act.", the court added.  Headnote Wakf Act, 1995- Section 32 and 40 - The Wakf Board has power to determine the nature of the property as wakf under Section 32(2)(n) but after complying with the procedure prescribed as contained in Section 40. Such procedure categorically prescribes an inquiry to be conducted. The conduct of inquiry pre-supposes compliance of the principles of natural justice so as to give opportunity of hearing to the affected parties. (Para 146) Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act, 1955 - The land dedicated for pious and religious purpose is not immune from its vesting with the State. (Para 196) Constitution of India, 1950- Article 226 - The State Government, as a juristic entity, has a right to protect its property through the writ court, just as any individual could have invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court. (Para 125) Wakf Act, 1995- The Wakf Board is a statutory authority under the 1954 Act as well as under the 1995 Act. The Official Gazette had to carry any notification at the instance of the Wakf Board. The State Government is not bound by the publication of the notification in the Official Gazette at the instance of the Wakf Board only for the reason that it has been published in the Official Gazette. The publication of a notice in an Official Gazette has a presumption of knowledge to the general public as an advertisement published in a newspaper. Therefore, mere reason that the notification was published in the State Government gazette is not binding on the State Government. (Para 132) Wakf Act, 1995- Section 32 and 40 - The power of the Board to investigate and determine the nature and extent of Wakf is not purely an administrative function- The power to determine under Section 32(2)(n) is the source of power but the manner of exercising that power is contemplated under Section 40 of the 1995 Act. An inquiry is required to be conducted if a Board on the basis of information collected finds that the property in question is a wakf property- There cannot be any unilateral decision without recording any reason that how and why the property is included as a wakf property. The finding of the Wakf Board is final, subject to the right of appeal under sub-section (2). Thus, any decision of the Board is required to be as a reasoned order which could be tested in appeal before the Wakf Tribunal. (Para 145) Wakf Act, 1995- Section 40(3) Proviso - If a trust or society is already registered but the Board finds it to be Wakf, the statute contemplates notice to the authority. It does not mean that such trust or society is not required to be heard. The hearing to Trust or Society would also be as per the principles of natural justice. (Para 147) Words and Phrases- Scope and meaning of the word "errata" discussed- "Errata" is a term of French origin which means a thing that should be corrected. It means a mistake in printing or writing - Errata is a correction of a mistake. Hence, only arithmetical and clerical mistakes could be corrected and the scope of the notification could not be enlarged by virtue of an errata notification, (Para 153-154) Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Atiyat Enquiries Act, 1952 - The Jurisdiction of the Atiyat Court would be limited to the disputes relating to Atiyat grants as defined in the Enquiries Act.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Monday observed that Judges should refrain from making harsh or disparaging remarks against counsels, parties or witnesses, unless it is absolutely necessary for deciding the case and until they are heard. The bench comprising Justice Mohan Lal remarked that Judges hold a "powerful seat" which must not be misused by indulging in intemperate comments, undignified banter or scathing criticism. "It is the general principle of highest importance to the proper administration of justice that derogatory remarks are not to be made against persons unless absolutely necessary for decision of the case to animadvert on their conduct." The Court was hearing a petition filed under section 482 CrPC wherein the petitioner had prayed for expunging the adverse remarks, observations and directions made by Special NIA Judge, Jammu in the order impugned.  The petitioner being a Deputy Superintendent of Police in J&K Police and investigation officer in two FIRs connected with the case before Special NIA Judge, was aggrieved by the observations made in the impugned order on the issue of framing of charge in those two matters.  In his order, the Trial Court had proceeded to record his observation and dissatisfaction against the manner in which the IO, i.e., the petitioner had conducted the investigation. It had remarked that observed investigation was "perfunctory" and that the petitioner conducted himself in an "unprofessional manner", among other things. The trial Court had further made personal remarks by casting aspersions on the selection of the Petitioner as a Deputy SP and had remarked that a much better investigation could have been conducted by even a "Head Constable".  The trial court had went even more ahead in its order and directed IGP Jammu that a departmental enquiry should be initiated against the said police officer, where he should be asked that why and under what circumstances he had not collected the real evidence in the said cases and left over the important aspects of the case.  Showing disapproval for such unwarranted observations by the trial court, Justice Mohan Lal observed that the limited controversy before the trial Court was to pass an order regarding the charge/discharge of the accused persons on the strength of the material collected by the investigating agency during investigation.  It was of the view that the petitioner as IO of the case, in his best wisdom, had collected all the material/evidence during the investigation conducted by him and had placed all the relevant evidence before the trial Court in the form of charge sheet. Hence, it was the duty of the Trial Court to evaluate/assess the entire evidence on the record and to prima-facie come to conclusion whether accused persons can be prima-facie charged/discharged for commission of offences indicted against them in the charge sheet. It was not at all necessary for the trial Court to have passed/recorded such harsh/disparaging remarks against the petitioner (being I/O of the case) in its order and this too when the trial court had not even afforded opportunity of explaining or defending the petitioner himself, the bench noted.   The bench also found it worthwhile to record the observations of Supreme Court in A.M. Mathur, Appellant V/s Pramod Kumar Gupta, wherein Supreme court had observed,  "Not only do judges have power to make binding decisions, their decisions legitimate the use of power by other officials. The Judges have the absolute and unchallengeable control of the Court domain. But they cannot misuse their authority by intemperate comments, undignified banter or scathing criticism of counsel, parties or witnesses".  Allowing the petition and expunging the derogatory remarks against the petitioner, the bench called upon the courts below to observe sobriety, moderation and reserve as the duty of restraint is humility of function and should be a constant theme of our Judges.  Higher the forum and greater the powers, the greater is the need for restraint and the more mellowed the reproach should be, the bench underscored.

It is time that the Government comes up with some regulatory measure to check the growth of such therapists: CourtThe Karnataka High Court has said the government should come up with some regulatory measures to check the growth of therapists, who offer their services online including via social media. A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna observed, "It is in public domain that there are huge mushrooming of so called therapies and therapists on social media i.e., Instagram, Twitter or Facebook as the case would be, wherein therapists pose themselves to be in the field of any therapy. It is also in public domain that they are all pseudo-therapists who are "instagram influencers". The court added there are many people on social media, who claim to be therapists but are not bound by any ethics or regulated by any norms.  "Cases of this nature have begun to emerge in large proportions here people wanting to get some therapy fall prey to such pseudo-therapists. Therefore, it is time that the Government comes up with some regulatory measure to check the growth of such therapists." The observations were made by the court while dismissing a petition filed by a woman, who is accused of offences punishable under Sections 66(C), 66(D) and 67(A) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Sections 419 and 420 of the IPC. She had sought quashing of the proceedings pending before an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Bangalore. The FIR: It was alleged by the complainant Shankar Ganesh P J, who is an IT professional, that he came in contact with the petitioner - Sanjana Fernandes alias Raveera, on the dating app Tinder.  According to the complaint, on a particular night when they were on chat, he claimed to be completely stressed and expressed it to Fernandes. She in response told him that she has an Instagram page "positivity-for-a-360-life" and claimed to be Wellness Therapist who promotes general well being of mind, body and soul. The man went on transferring money to her account after "on a class to class basis" during the period of COVID-19 lockdown. The classes took place on Instagram. However, the story took a turn when the man got interested in meeting the woman in person and started sending lewd messages to her.  He also allegedly sent indecent messages containing pornography and other material to the woman, resulting in she blocking his account. Peeved at her reaction, the man began to dig into the veracity of the therapy that the woman claimed and found out that she had 15 such profiles of Instagram and other social media.  He then registered a complaint against the woman for the offence of cheating and the offence under the Information Technology Act, leading to registration of the FIR. Findings: The bench on going through the chargesheet noted that the petitioner - the accused, initially sent a message to the complainant - the man, on Tinder and later they communicated on Instagram.  Then the court went through the consent form signed by the complainant before joining the therapy sessions.  It said, "The complainant has no doubt signed the consent form but that does not mean that the petitioner can escape the clutches of law merely because the complainant has signed the consent form. There is no document or rather is an admitted fact that the petitioner has no qualification to be in the field of any kind of wellness therapy as projected. It is her own generated web page, without any qualification. Therefore it is a case where the petitioner without any substance or qualification lured the customers into the web of wellness therapy through the web page." Commenting on the chats, the court said it was the accused who lured the complainant into the wellness therapy. It added that the police investigation has revealed that she has several such web pages in different names.  "In fact the name of the petitioner is not even divulged in the therapy that she has administered upon the complainant in the subject petition. Therefore, it becomes necessary for a trial for the petitioner to come out clean," said the court. The court further said the accused is required to come out clean as the offences alleged against her are punishable under Section 419 (cheating by personation) IPC and Section 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) IPC. It observed, "The chats would reveal that the petitioner had initially represented that she is a wellness therapist and her team would take care of the complainant. Therefore, without having any team or any qualification whatsoever, it was the web page prima facie created to lure the complainant and the like. It is therefore, the offence of cheating comes clearly made out against the petitioner." The court also said that offences alleged are the one punishable under the Information Technology Act. "An entry in the complaint or the summary of the charge sheet clearly makes out an offence that would become ingredients of Sections 66(C) & (D) and 67(A) of the Information Technology Act and these are in the realm of seriously disputed questions of fact," it said. The court also noted that the woman has registered a case against the man for sending him lewd messages and the same is pending adjudication.  Finally the court held, "I do not find any warrant to interfere with the case on hand as the petitioner has not demonstrated by production of such unimpeachable evidence of sterling character for this Court to interfere or interject the proceedings in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC." It added: "Since the wellness therapy has generated such illness as is complained of by the complainant and finding no merit in the petition, the petition stands dismissed" Case Title: SANJANA FERNANDES @ RAVEERA v.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Wednesday observed that disputes between the two limbs of Government of India should not be brought to the Court, to be fought for years at the expense of public exchequer.  "It would be desirable to relegate the parties to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Mechanism provided under the Office Memo" , the court observed.  The observations were made by Justice Sanjeev Kumar while hearing a plea in terms of which the Hotel Corporation of India had challenged the notice for termination of the lease and subsequent eviction notice issued by the Estates Officer concerned.  The petitioner Corporation also challenged the order passed by the Appellate Authority under the J&K Public Premises (Eviction of unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1988 dismissing its appeal against the eviction notice.  Justice Kumar observed that the Hotel Corporation of India Ltd. is an autonomous body/Public Sector Undertaking subject to ultimate administrative control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India and the other party to the litigation is the Government of UT of Jammu and Kashmir which under the Constitution of India is administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.  "The dispute raised in this petition is, thus, a dispute between an Autonomous Body (the petitioner-Corporation) fully owned, controlled and administered by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir which is administered by the President of India through Lieutenant Governor who is answerable to the President through the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India", the court stated.  Deprecating the tendency of various Government Departments and the Public Sector Undertaking entering into litigation inter se and consuming public time and public exchequer, the court observed that such disputes between the two limbs of Government of India should not be brought to the Court.  Revealing its mind to address the controversy, the bench observed that the termination of lease and issuance of eviction notice by the Government of Jammu is resisted by the petitioner corporation and many issues of law and fact were debated before me in the matter. However, instead of going into all these issues and having regard to the fact that the dispute is between two limbs of Government of India, it would be desirable to relegate the parties to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Mechanism provided under the Office Memo issued by the Law Ministry for settlement of disputes other than relating to taxation.  Accordingly the bench disposed off the plea by directing the Government of India through its Cabinet Secretary to constitute a Committee comprising of (i) Secretary to the Government Ministry of Civil Aviation, (ii) Secretary to the Government, Department of Home Affairs, and (iii) Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs to adjudicate the dispute in question that has arisen between the petitioner-Corporation and the Government of UT of Jammu and Kashmir.  The court further directed that in case any of the parties is aggrieved by the decision of the Committee aforesaid, it shall be open to it to file an appeal before the Cabinet Secretary whose decision, on the subject, shall be final and binding on both the parties.  "Should the Committee at its level fail to resolve the dispute between the parties for any reason whatsoever, the matter shall be referred to the Cabinet Secretary whose decision shall be final and binding on all the concerned", the bench added while giving Cabinet Secretary four weeks time to constitute a Committee from the date of judgment under an intimation to the disputing parties.

The Delhi High Court has said that findings of departmental authorities in disciplinary proceedings cannot be challenged by the employee under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, on the grounds of adequacy or reliability. "It is also a settled proposition that if the enquiry is properly held the departmental authorities are the sole judge of facts," Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma said.  The court was dealing with a writ petition filed by a bank employee, who was dismissed from service in 1995 for misconduct and fraud after a departmental enquiry was conducted by the bank. The employee challenged the award passed by the Central Government Industrial Tribunal (CGIT), where the petitioner’s claim for reinstatement in service was dismissed.  Ruling that it does not deem it fit to interfere with the finding of fact returned by the Industrial Tribunal holding the petitioner guilty for misconduct, the court said:  “In the banking business absolute devotion, integrity and honesty are a sine qua non for every bank employee. It requires that the employees maintain good conduct and discipline as they deal with the money of the depositors and the customers and if it is not observed, the confidence of the public/depositors would be impaired. The banking system is the backbone of the Indian economy. An officer who is found to have been involved in financial irregularities while performing his duty as a bank officer, cannot be let off even if there is a minor infraction in the inquiry report.”  In the department enquiry initiated against the petitioner, Sneh Aggarwal, it was found that she had committed fraud while working as an Advanced Level Punching Machine Operator in the branch office of the Punjab National Bank (PNB). The case against her was that while she had issued FDR for a sum of Rs. 60,000, only a sum of Rs. 6,000 was deposited with the bank.  Concurring with the Enquiry Report submitted by the Enquiry Officer, the Disciplinary Authority imposed a punishment of dismissal from service on her. She, thereafter, raised an industrial dispute and the matter was referred to the Industrial Tribunal, which upheld the punishment of dismissal.  The Tribunal ruled that the bank was able to prove beyond doubt Aggarwal's misconduct. The Tribunal concluded that she was acting against the interest of the bank and that the enquiry conducted by the Enquiry officer was in consonance with principles of natural justice.  Aggarwal challenged the award of the Industrial Tribunal before the High Court. She argued that the findings of the Tribunal were perverse and contradictory, were based on conjectures and irrelevant material and thus, the High Court can interfere with the findings in exercise of its writ jurisdiction.  The court noted that the legislature has not provided any appeal against the award of the Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal, making the Labour Court/ Industrial Tribunal the final adjudicator of facts.  “It is a settled proposition that the award of the Labour Court can be set aside only if there is an error apparent on the face of the record. It is impermissible for the High Courts under its writ jurisdiction to re-appreciate evidence and substitute its view with that of the Labour Court/ Tribunals," the court said.  The bench added: “thus, in writ jurisdiction, the High Court can interfere with an Award of the Labour Court/Tribunal, if there is patent illegality or if the award rendered is contrary to law as a measure of ‘misplaced sympathy’ and was thus perverse. If the Tribunal under special legislation is empowered to decide jurisdictional facts, the High Court cannot adjudicate upon the question of facts decided by such Tribunals.”  The court took note that, based on the oral submissions and documentary evidence produced by the parties before it, the Industrial Tribunal had categorically held that the services of the petitioner were legally and justifiably terminated.  “A bare perusal of the enquiry proceedings also crystallises that due and reasonable opportunities were given to the Petitioner/workman to defend herself," the court said. The court said the petitioner has only raised disputed questions of facts which were examined by the Tribunal as the fact finding court.  "The Tribunal and before that the departmental authorities i.e; the disciplinary authority and appellate authority have all concluded that the Petitioner/workman misconducted herself and was not a reliable person to be kept in the employment of the bank,” the court observed, adding it does not find any infirmity, perversity, illegality, or jurisdictional error in the impugned order. However, the bench took into account that the petitioner had served the Bank for 13 years and there was no complaint or criminal proceedings initiated against her during the said period. The Court thus modified the punishment by substituting the punishment of removal from service to that of compulsory retirement. "The petitioner thus shall be entitled to all benefits which may be available to her by correcting the punishment from that of removal from service to that of compulsory retirement. The present petition is thus allowed to the aforesaid extent," said the court.

The Karnataka High Court has said that the Appellate Court should be very cautious and exercise the discretion judiciously while remanding the matter for a de-novo trial.  A single judge bench of Justice Dr HB Prabhakara Sastry, set aside the order dated September 2, 2013 passed by the appellate court which had in turn set aside the conviction handed down by the trial court under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI) against the accused and remanded the matter to the trial Court ordering for a de-novo trial.  The bench said,  "When the evidence of the parties, in the chief examination, cross examination and re-examination (if any) were recorded in verbatim and was faithfully placed on record then for merely not recording the order observing that the matter would be tried as a summons case or as a regular trial would not itself vitiate the trial conducted by the Magistrate of the Trial Court, when it has not resulted in miscarriage of justice."  The bench noted that as per Section 143 of the N.I. Act, the nature of the proceedings for the trial for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is summary in nature. However, the very same Section also enables the Magistrate when it appears to him that the nature of the case is such that, a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding one year may have to be passed or that it is, for any other reason, undesirable to try the case summarily, after hearing the parties, to record an order to that effect and thereafter recall any witness who may have been examined and proceed to hear or re-hear the case in the manner provided by the Criminal Procedure Code. Thus, it enables the Magistrate to try the case as a summons case.  Further the bench said the accused in the Trial Court itself, had taken a contention that a de novo trial is required to be conducted by the Magistrate. However, the Magistrate of the Trial Court in her impugned judgment has made a detailed discussion on the contention taken up by the accused and has made a specific observation that the predecessor Magistrate had recorded the entire memorandum of evidence of witnesses and not the substance of evidence as required under the summary trial.  Noting that the predecessor Magistrate had not recorded only the substance of evidence. The predecessor Magistrate might have decided to try the case as a warrant case, the bench observed,  "Therefore, the Magistrate of the Trial Court adopted the procedure which has to be adopted in a warrant trial while recording his evidence. She recorded the memorandum of evidence given by the witness in full and given sufficient opportunity to the opponent party to cross-examine the witness fully and thoroughly and has recorded the evidence in its entirety as given by the parties."  It added,  "However, the Sessions Judge's Court only on the point that the Magistrate, before proceeding to record the evidence as in summons case or a warrant case, had not recorded her reason in writing, had set aside the impugned judgment passed by the Trial Court and remanded the matter to the Trial Court for a de novo trial."  Finally the court held, "The Sessions Judge's Court ought to have decided the appeal before it on its merit, as such, the revision under consideration deserves to be allowed and the matter requires to be remanded to the Sessions Judge's Court for its fresh disposal, in accordance with law."

The Allahabad High Court has held that a wife's silence or lack of protest at the time of adoption by her husband cannot give rise to an inference that she has consented to such adoption under Section 7 of the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act, 1956. "The court cannot presume the consent of wife simply because she was present at the time of adoption," a Division Bench... The Allahabad High Court has held that a wife's silence or lack of protest at the time of adoption by her husband cannot give rise to an inference that she has consented to such adoption under Section 7 of the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act, 1956.  "The court cannot presume the consent of wife simply because she was present at the time of adoption," a Division Bench comprising of Justices Manoj Misra and Rohit Ranjan Agarwal has ruled.  It held that in order to satisfy the mandate of the proviso to Section 7 of the Act, a party propounding adoption by a Hindu male, who has a living wife, has to adduce evidence to prove that the same was done with the consent of his wife.   "This can be done either by producing document evidencing her consent in writing or by leading evidence to show that wife had actively participated in the ceremonies of adoption with an affirmative mindset to support the action of the husband to take a son or a daughter in adoption," the Bench said.  [Section 7 states: Any male Hindu who is of sound mind and is not a minor has the capacity to take a son or a daughter in adoption: Provided that, if he has a wife living, he shall not adopt except with the consent of his wife unless the wife has completely and finally renounced the world or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind.]  Background  In the case at hand, the Appellant's claim for compassionate appointment in place of his deceased (alleged) adoptive father Rajendra Singh was denied inter alia because the latter had a living wife.  The concerned authority had rejected the adoption deed relied by the Appellant on the ground that it depicted the adoptive father as unmarried, even though he had a living wife named Phoolmati. It noted that without the Phoolmati's consent, the Appellant's adoption could not be said to be a valid one.  A plea against the said order was dismissed by a Single Bench of the High Court following which, the instant appeal was filed.  The Appellant had taken two primary grounds before the Division Bench: (i) by a decree dated 31.08.1997 the marriage of the deceased (alleged) adoptive father Rajendra Singh with his wife Phoolmati stood dissolved; (ii) even if it is assumed that there was no legal divorce, she, by living separate from her husband, had renounced the world therefore her consent was not necessary.   Further, the Appellant had argued that Section 16 of the HAMA raises a presumption as to the validity of adoption on presentation of a deed in that behalf and since there was no serious contest to his adoption by any of the successors of the deceased, he ought to have been provided the benefit of adoption by raising that presumption.  Findings  All the three arguments raised by the Appellant came to be demolished by the Division Bench.   1. With respect to the alleged divorce deed, the Court observed,  "The alleged decree, which has been brought on the record is not a decree of divorce. It only disposes off divorce proceeding in terms of the compromise."  The said compromise recorded that Rajendra Singh and Phoolmati shall continue to remain husband and wife and that the former shall pay Rs. 5000/- to the latter towards litigation expenses.  2. With respect to the argument that Phoolmati had not been in the company of her husband and therefore it could be taken that she had renounced the world and, as such, her consent would not be required- the Court held that the requirement of consent of the wife, under the proviso to section 7 of the 1956 Act, cannot be dispensed with where there is no dissolution of marriage even though the wife might be estranged from her husband and staying separate.  It observed,  "the consent of even an estranged wife for taking in adoption would be required, if the marriage has not been dissolved. No doubt, consent of wife would not be required where the marriage has been dissolved or the wife has completely renounced the world or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind. But, here, it has not been proved that the marriage was dissolved. Rather, the document produced is to the contrary."  Reliance was placed on Brajendra Singh v. State of MP, (2008) 13 SCC 161 where the Apex Court had held, "There is conceptual and contextual difference between a divorced woman and one who is leading life like a divorced woman. Both cannot be equated."  3. With respect to the Appellant's argument vis-à-vis nature of presumption of the adoption deed, the Court made it clear that such presumption is rebuttable.   It noted that in the instant case, the adoption deed on which reliance was placed by the Appellant declared his alleged adoptive father as unmarried whereas, it is established on the record, that he was married and had a wife living on the date of adoption.   In this backdrop the Division Bench concluded,  "Once it was proved that Rajendra Singh had a living wife, the presumption, if any, arising from that deed with regard to the adoption being in accordance with the provisions of the 1956 Act stood demolished because how could it be presumed that the wife had given her consent for her husband to take a son in adoption when even the existence of that wife is not acknowledged.   In fact in the adoption deed Rajendra Singh has been described as unmarried. Thus, when clinching evidence had come on board that the person who allegedly took the appellant in adoption had a living wife, whose existence was denied in the deed, the presumption, whatever available, stood rebutted."

The Karnataka High Court has held that a family settlement arrived at between parties to share immovable properties has to be among all the family members who agree to common terms and conditions and an agreement in writing between two parties to the suit arrived before the panchayat is not acceptable, unless it is a registered document. A single judge bench of Justice... The Karnataka High Court has held that a family settlement arrived at between parties to share immovable properties has to be among all the family members who agree to common terms and conditions and an agreement in writing between two parties to the suit arrived before the panchayat is not acceptable, unless it is a registered document.  A single judge bench of Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum allowed the appeal filed by Krishnappa and others and set aside the appellate court order.  The bench said,  "Family settlement involves participation and the same needs to be signed by all the members and there has to be an acknowledgment when the agreement is arrived at, free of duress and coercion within the family members. A family settlement is admissible in evidence provided that the agreement is confirmed with approval of all family members who firmly support resolution given in the agreement at a later date which does not require registration."  The appellate court had decreed the suit in entirety, granting share to the plaintiff (Ashwathamma, daughter of original plaintiff) in all the properties. The appellate court, having assessed oral and documentary evidence, had placed strong reliance on 'panchayath palupatti' to arrive at its conclusion.  It was of the view that the parties had amicably resolved to share the properties equally and accordingly, the defendant had agreed under the panchayath palupatti to allot half share.  The appellate court had also placed reliance on judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Polti Lakshmi vs. Krishnavenamma, AIR 1965 SC 825, where it was held that palupatti does not require registration.  Findings:  The High Court observed that palupatti is not in the nature of a "family arrangement" as all the family members have not participated and have not signed it.; It does not indicate that all the assets are part of a common family.  "The main requirement of a family arrangement is that all the family members have to agree and such an agreement should indicate that rights and title of the parties to the arrangement is voluntarily accepted by all the members and the same is acknowledged under the very document."  It added, "One more requisite condition for a family arrangement is that each party to the agreement should recognize the right of other members, as they had previously asserted it, to the portions allotted to them respectively."  It also held that if the parties have reduced the family agreement into writing with an intention of using that writing as an evidence of what they have negotiated and when the arrangement is brought on by the document alone, then the said document requires registration in terms of Section 17(1) of the Registration Act.  Accordingly it held ,  "The document does not indicate that it is in the nature of family arrangement. The document does not indicate that all the family members have participated and therefore, the document is inadmissible in evidence. Secondly, the agreement is sought to be reduced into writing and therefore, it compulsorily requires registration. Ex.P-20 does not record previously negotiated terms but what can be gathered is under the document, plaintiff and defendant No.1 have agreed to take equal share and therefore, it is not a family arrangement but it amounts to a partition deed during the pendency of the suit and therefore, the said document requires registration and is subject to payment of stamp duty."  The bench further held that the Appellate Court erred in not taking note of the fact that plaintiff failed to discharge the initial burden. "The findings of the Trial Court is based on rebuttal evidence. Therefore, the Appellate Court erred in reversing the judgment and decree of the Trial Court by placing reliance on Ex.P-20."  Accordingly, it allowed the appeal and restored the judgment and decree passed by the trial court which held that that only two items of schedule property were joint family ancestral property and dismissed the suit qua the rest items.

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to a man who has been accused of running a fake lottery to dupe Indian nationals and sending the money to handlers in Pakistan. The Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal opined that even though the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act have not been initiated against the bail-applicant, prakash, however, since the matter pertains to national security and therefore, it is not a fit case for bail. The Case in brief Essentially, the bail applicant had been booked under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 of the Indian Penal Code after it was found in the police probe that he was in touch with Pakistani nationals, who are involved in a racket of running fake lotteries in India. Thereafter, the bail applicant was apprehended along with another man, and 30 ATM cards, a Driving Licence, Rs.2500/- cash, three mobile phones, and one Samsung tablet were recovered from his possession.  Allegedly, both of them confessed that they are involved in duping the Indian nationals by opening fake accounts thereby facilitating the Pakistani nationals in using the said account. It was further alleged that he used to open fake accounts on the basis of forged documents and asked the Indian nationals to deposit their money in the said fake accounts on the pretext of getting lottery and after deducting their commissions, the accused persons transferred the remaining amount to the accounts of Pakistani handlers. Opposing his bail plea, the State's counsel argued that it had been proved that many account numbers and cash deposit receipts have been sent to Pakistan through Whatsapp. He also referred to statements of various persons who have been duped by the said nexus run by the applicant and the co-accused Dhiruddin Chaudhary with Pakistani nationals.  It was further submitted that the evidence collected during the investigation categorically establishes the offences and the activity of the accused applicant with the handlers sitting in Pakistan and that the charge-sheet against the applicant had been filed for the offences u/s 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B IPC and further investigation of the case is still in progress. Lastly, it was told to the Court that the data analysis of mobile numbers had revealed the details of the Whatsapp chatting and audio clips with the handlers sitting in Pakistan wherein 81 bank deposit receipts have also been sent to Pakistani handlers as proof of deposit.  Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the number of articles recovered from the possession of the applicant and also the evidence placed on record as well as the submissions advanced by the counsel for the parties, the Court was of the view that since the matter pertains to national security have not been initiated against the applicant as yet, the Court didn't find it a fit case for bail.   
The Allahabad High Court has observed that an Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. can't be filed against a summoning order passed by a Special Judge in an SC/ST Act Offence. The Court observed thus while taking into account Section 14A(1) of the S.C./S.T. Act. In the instant matter before the Court, an application under 482 CrPC was moved praying to quash the summoning order passed by II Additional Sessions Judge/ Special Judge, S.C./S.T. Act, Lakhimpur Kheri against the applicant for offences u/s 323/504/506 I.P.C. & 3(1) of the SC/ST Act It may be noted that Section 14A (1) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 commences with a non-obstante clause and is designed to override the general provisions contained in the Cr.P.C. Let's read, what does it say: "14A. Appeals.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an appeal shall lie, from any judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order, of a Special Court or an Exclusive Special Court, to the High Court both on facts and on law." In simpler terms, under Section 14A(1) of the SC/ST Act, an appeal shall lie from any judgment, cognizance order, order not being interlocutory order of Special Court, or an exclusive Special Court to the High Court, both on facts and on the law. Essentially, this means that while the constitutional and inherent powers of this Court are not "ousted" by Section 14A, they cannot be invoked in cases and situations where an appeal would lie under Section 14A and this position of law has already been accepted by the Top Court in Re: Provision of Section 14a of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015. Now, the only question before the High Court was - as to whether the word "order" as occurring in subsection (1) of Section 14A would also include intermediate orders and as to whether taking cognizance of an offence and summoning the accused is intermediate order. To answer this, the Bench of Justice Anil Ojha referred to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Girish Kumar Suneja v. CBI, (2017) 14 SCC 809, in which it was held that taking cognizance of an offence and summoning the accused is an intermediate order. Further, referring to Re: Provision of Section 14a of SC/ST (supra), the Court held that the word "order" as occurring in subsection(1) of Section 14A would also include intermediate orders, which would mean that summoning order, being an intermediate order can't be challenged under Section 482 CrPC and the same could be challenged only under Section 14A of the SC/ST Act. In view of the above discussion, the Court came to the conclusion that Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. cannot be filed against summoning order passed by II Additional Sessions Judge/ Special Judge, S.C./S.T. Act, Lakhimpur Kheri Moving ahead, the Court noted that in its instant plea a direction was sought to command the court below to decide the bail application of the applicants providing them the benefit of the legal proposition laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Satender Kumar Antil vs. CBI LL 2021 SC 550. In Satender Kumar Antil (supra), the Apex Court had issued guidelines to trial courts and High Courts to keep them in mind while considering the bail applications. Essentially, the Supreme Court had issued guidelines on the aspect of grant of bail to accused who are not arrested during investigation on charge sheet being filed. Read more about the case here: Supreme Court Issues Guidelines On Grant Of Bail To Accused Not Arrested During Investigation On Filing Of Chargesheet During the course of arguments, the Advocates complained that Districts Courts do not follow dictum of Satender Kumar Antil (supra) unless specifically directed by the High Court.  Calling it as a sorry state of affair, the Court stressed that ruling in the case of Satender Kumar Antil (supra) is the law of land and is binding upon all courts in India and there is no need to issue a separate order regarding the same.  However, the Court ordered that a copy of the order be sent to the Registrar General of Allahabad High Court, who, if required, may issue circular to all the courts in the State of Uttar Pradesh under subordination of High Court of Judicature at Allahabad to follow the law laid down by the Apex Court in Satender Kumar Antil (supra). Consequently, the Application U/s 482 Cr.P.C. was disposed of with the observation that applicants are permitted to file fresh petition before the appropriate forum.

Rejecting his plea of mental incapacity, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a man accused of killing his two sons. "Where the accused is charged of murder, the burden to prove that as a result of unsoundness of mind, the accused was incapable of knowing the consequences of his acts is on the defence", the bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sudhanshu Dhulia observed while dismissing a criminal appeal. The court found that he was neither suffering from any medically determined mental illness nor could be said to be a person under a legal disability of unsound mind. The prosecution case against the appellant Prem Singh was that, on 3.5.2009, he took his two sons, aged about 9 years and 6 years, to Haiderpur Canal, and strangulated them. Thereafter, he threw the dead bodies into the canal; and attempted to project as if it were a case of accidental drowning. It was also alleged that he was a drunkard, who doubted the chastity of his wife and suspected that the children were not his sons. The Trial Court convicted him under Sections 302 and 201 IPC and the same was upheld by the Delhi High Court.  Before the Apex Court, he took the following contentions - (1) there was no reason or motive for him to kill his own sons; and the alleged want of explanation on the part of the accused cannot be a ground for conviction in the present case; (2) the Trial Court omitted to examine the capacity of the appellant in terms of Section 329 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19733 while ignoring the material evidence on record to the effect that the accused was not a person of sound mental disposition, for he was admitted to a rehabilitation centre for de-addiction and was discharged against the advice of the centre. While rejecting the first contention, the bench observed thus:  It is, of course, the duty of prosecution to lead the primary evidence of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt but, when necessary evidence had indeed been led, the corresponding burden was heavy on the appellant in terms of Section 106 of the Evidence Act to explain as to what had happened at the time of incident and as to how the death of the deceased occurred. There had not been any explanation on the part of the appellant and, as noticed, immediately after the incident, he attempted to create a false narrative of accidental drowning of the children. There had not been any specific response from the appellant in his statement under Section 313 CrPC either. The court said that when the evidence on record unambiguously proves the guilt of the accused, the factor relating to motive cannot displace or weaken the conclusions naturally flowing from the evidence. Moreover, the present case cannot be said to be of want of motive altogether, it said. The court further noted that the plea of unsoundness of mind was never taken in the trial nor any evidence was led in this regard. It said that there is nothing on record to find that the appellant was a person of unsound mind at the time of commission of crime or was a person of unsound mind when tried in this case. Post-conviction behaviour is hardly of any relevance so far as present appeal is concerned, it said. While dismissing the appeal, the bench observed: The evidence on record, taken as a whole, at the most shows that the appellant was addicted to alcohol and was admitted to the rehabilitation centre for de-addiction. However, there is absolutely nothing on record to show that the appellant was medically treated as a person of unsound mind or was legally required to be taken as a person of unsound mind There was no fault on the part of the Trial Court or the investigating agency, it is also noteworthy that contrary to even a trace of want of mental capacity of the appellant at the time of commission of the crimes in question, the manner of commission, with strangulation of the children one by one; throwing of their dead bodies into the canal; appellant himself swimming in the canal and coming out; and immediately thereafter, stating before several persons that the children had accidentally slipped into the canal so as to project it as a case of accidental drowning, if at all, show an alert and calculative mind, which had worked with specific intent to cause the death of the children and to cause disappearance of evidence by throwing dead bodies into the canal and thereafter, to mislead by giving a false narrative. By no logic and by no measure of assessment, the appellant, who is found to have carried all the aforesaid misdeeds, could be said to be a person of unsound mind.

The Sikkim High Court recently dismissed a petition challenging the Sikkim State Subordinate Fisheries Service (Amendment) Rules, 2019 which did away with the age relaxation given to the ST, SC, MBC and OBC candidates by the Fisheries Rules, 2008.  Justice Bhaskar Raj Pradhan observed that it is open for the government while framing rules under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India to prescribe such age limits or to prescribe the extent to which any relaxation can be given.  "The issue whether the State has the power to frame rules under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India to prescribe age limits or the extent of relaxation to be given has been lucidly explained by the Supreme Court holding inter alia that it is open for the government while framing rules under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India to prescribe such age limits or to prescribe the extent to which any relaxation can be given. The Supreme Court further held that prescription of such limit or the extent of relaxation to be given cannot be termed as arbitrary or unreasonable. Thus, the challenge to the Amendment Rules, 2019 is rejected."  Article 309 empowers framing of Rules for recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving the Union or a State. The present writ petition was filed by four petitioners. All of them were aspiring to join the Sub-ordinate Fisheries Service as Fisheries Block Officer. The controversy in the present case relates to the eligibility condition for the said post. Fisheries Rules, 2008 stipulated age between 18 years to 30 years as an eligibility condition with relaxation of 5 years for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates and 3 years for Most Backward Classes (MBC) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) candidates. Petitioners 1 and 2 are SC and Petitioners 3 and 4 are OBC.  The 2019 Amendment Rules did away with this relaxation and subsequently, an advertisement was issued on 26.08.2021 for recruitment.  On 12.01.2022 the Public Service Commission published the rejected list of 96 candidates in which the petitioners featured. The rejection list stated that they were overage. The petitioners claimed that they had the necessary educational qualification and challenged the Amendment as being violative of Article 14, 16 and 335 (Claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to services and posts) of the Constitution of India. Petitioners submitted that although Article 335 of the Constitution of India is not enforceable however, it is the paramount duty of the welfare state to ensure that it achieves its purpose.  The Respondent-authorities argued standardization of age for all categories of candidates was a policy decision of the government which cannot be challenged by the writ petitioner more so when they themselves have participated in the selection process by making their online applications which were rejected.  It argued that the petitioners have failed to display how their rights under Article 14 or 16 were violated and in case the writ petition was to be allowed and a direction issued to give age relaxation, flood gates would open.  The respondent also argued that Article 335 of the Constitution of India must be read in consonance with Article 16 (4) of the Constitution of India.  After hearing both the sides the court was of opinion that there is a presumption that the notification was validly made by the government unless proved that it was not.  "The burden laid down by Section 101 and 102 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 has not substituted by the petitioners. Neither in the pleadings in the writ petition nor during arguments by the learned counsel for the petitioners it was shown that the Amendment Rules, 2019 was ultra vires the Constitution of India or any other law." It added that the posts and services for recruitment in specific departments including any other posts and services which have specifically prescribed upper age limit lower than 30 years in their recruitment rules are kept outside the purview of the notification.  "The Amendment Rules, 2019 which amended the schedule seems to be in line with the policy decision of the Government when it prescribed that the incumbent should have attained the age of 21 years and should not have exceeded 30 years for all communities. The prayer of the petitioners for a direction upon the State respondents to relax the age prescribed in the Amendment Rules, 2019 with the strength of the judgment passed by the Jharkhand High Court cannot also be accepted as the circumstances prevailing in the State of Jharkhand when the judgment was passed cannot be equated with what has been pleaded in the present proceedings."  In view of the above the court was of opinion that scope of judicial review of policy decision of the government is very narrow and the present writ petition does not qualify as the exceptional one calling for interference. Accordingly, the writ was dismissed.  Case Title: Tshering Samdup Bhutia and Ors. v. State of Sikkim and Ors.   
The Gujarat High court has reiterated that removal of a person's name from the voters' list is not an "extraordinary circumstance" warranting invocation of High Court's extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. It held that a person aggrieved must avail statutory remedy by filing election petition under Rule 28. A Bench comprising Justice Biren Vaishnav and Justice Sandeep Bhatt affirmed the following observations made by a single judge, "Once the process of election has been set in motion this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India would not interfere in the election process. Accordingly this Court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned order passed by the respondent No.3 and relegate the writ applicant to avail statutory remedy by filing election petition under Rule 28.  The rejection of the writ-applicant's name from the voters' list results in exclusion of name of the writ-applicant from the voters' list...the writ-applicant can avail the benefit of provisions of Rule 28 of the Rules by filing the election petition. The authority under Rule 28 has wide power to cancel and, confirm and amend the election and also to direct to hold fresh election in case the election is set aside and the remedy under Rule 28 is an efficacious remedy." It was claimed that the Appellant's name was deleted from the voter's list and vide an LPA, the Appellant's objection to get his name on the voter's list was also rejected.  To Division Bench relied on Daheda Group Seva Sahakari Mandli Limited vs. R. D. Rohit, Authorised Officer and Cooperative Officer (Marketing) 2006 (1) GCD 211 where it was held that the inclusion or exclusion of names in the voter's list could not be termed as extraordinary circumstances warranting interference by the High Court under Art 226.  Reference was made to Ahmedabad Cotton Mfg. Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. (18 GLR 714) where it was held that even though the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution is very wide, yet the Court should be slow in exercising this jurisdiction where there are alternative remedies available.  In this backdrop, the Single Judge had refused to interfere in the matter. It had however granted liberty to the Petitioner approach the competent authority by raising an election dispute as contemplated under Rule 28 of the Rules, if he is aggrieved by the result of election.  "If such petition is filed, it shall be considered by the competent authority independently and uninfluenced by the findings recorded," it had ordered. The Division Bench herein also refused to take a view different and accordingly, the appeals were rejected.

In a case pertaining to rape on account of false promise to marriage, the Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur observed that married educated women, depending upon the facts of each case, is supposed to be well aware of the consequences of having sexual intercourse with a man prior to solemnizing of the marriage.  The court opined that the consent of a woman under Section 375 of IPC can be held vitiated only on the ground of misconception of fact where such misconception was the basis of her surrender for establishing physical relationship. The court further opined that a breach of promise cannot be said to be a false promise. To establish a false promise, the maker of the promise should have had no intention of upholding his words at the time of giving it, added the court.  Justice Farjand Ali, observed,  "When a woman is married and educated, then, depending on facts of each case, she is supposed to be well aware of the consequences of having sexual intercourse with a man prior to solemnizing of the marriage. In the event of a consent obtained by fraud, inducement is a necessary ingredient. There must be some material on record to hold prima facie that the girl was induced by the accused to such an extent that she was in agreement to have sexual intercourse with him"  The court also opined that in rape cases, the act of sexual intercourse must be forcible and without consent of the woman/lady. However, the court added that the consent obtained by fraud amounts to no consent and therefore, if the intercourse is done with consent but obtained by fraud, it would amount to rape.  It was remarked,  "If an illiterate woman is given promise to marry and under that promise, her consent is obtained for sexual intercourse, then, it can be said that the consent is obtained by fraud. Here, in this case, the prosecutrix is an educated lady and serving as a lady jail guard. Another instance would be that if consent is obtained by hiding the identity or impersonation, then it is a fraud. If a married man obtains consent of an unmarried girl under the false pretext that he will marry her by concealing the fact of his previous marriage, then the consent given by the young girl shall be construed to be a consent obtained fraudulently and thus it is no consent. Here, in this matter, both the parties are not previously married."  The court examined that there is not an iota of evidence or whisper regarding the fact that right from the inception, the accused was having a dishonest intention; rather in juxtaposition, the facts reveal that there was a consensual sexual relationship between the parties and thus, no offence as alleged in the FIR is made out for which the petitioner can be forced to face the rigor of a trial.  Placing reliance on Prashant Bharti v. State of NCT of Delhi and State of Haryana v. Ch. Bhajan Lal, the court deemed appropriate to allow the criminal misc. petitions and to quash the proceedings that arose out of the FIR impugned. In both the cases, the Apex court has discussed the scope of powers of the High Court to quash FIR/complaint/all criminal proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. in detail and has determined such instances where FIR/complaint/all criminal proceedings can be quashed.  The court ordered,  "Accordingly, the criminal misc. petitions are allowed. The FIR No. 36/2020 registered at P.S. Mahila Thana, Distt. Alwar for the offences under Sections 376-D, 418 and 506 of IPC, and all consequential proceedings undertaken in pursuance thereof, are hereby quashed and set aside. The concerned SHO is directed to prepare a closure report of the case and to submit the same before the learned Magistrate concerned within a period of one month from the date of receipt of this order."  Further, the court observed that there is no mention in the FIR as to what point of time the accused refused to marry with the petitioner and in 2018, when the cause of action had arisen, the prosecutrix refused to sue the petitioner; rather, on the contrary, even thereafter she continued her relations with the petitioner. The court found no video clip or other material has been collected or produced by which inference of threat can be drawn. Keeping mum for long in reporting the matter also creates serious doubts in the story, opined the court.  The court also observed that this is an unfortunate but routine case of a boy and a girl having an affair, indulging into a sexual relationship and ultimately ending into a breakup. The court added that present is one of such cases where the parties had consensual sexual relationship and were in love with each other, however, the relationship become sour by the lapse of time.  On perusal of statements and reports, the court found no offence under Section 375 IPC. The messages exchanged between the parties also suggest that at least no offence, as alleged, can be brought under the ambit of Section 375 of IPC, added the court. The court opined that the excuses taken regarding consent given under misconception are prima facie appears to be flimsy and unconvincing.  Facts  In this matter, the prosecutrix is a Jail guard at Central Jail, Bikaner and in 2018, she rented premises at Jaipur for exam coaching. One Dinesh Meena told her that a boy named Radha Kishan Meena-petitioner is serving in the Department of Customs at Gujarat and would be a suitable groom for her. The accused allegedly coaxed her to marry him, for which she consented. It is alleged that on 18.4.2018, the petitioner called her to meet, upon which they both met and she sat as a pillion rider on the motorcycle driven by the petitioner.  It is alleged that she wanted to go to Jodhpur for a physical examination related to the recruitment process and for that purpose she asked the petitioner to drop her at Rajgarh Railway Station, but the accused took her to the residence of a relative of the accused petitioner. As per allegations, the prosecutrix was induced by the accused to develop physical relations and she surrendered herself before him on account of promise to marry her.  It is further alleged that thereafter on several occasions, sexual intercourse was committed upon her at different places and lastly when she made a protest, she was threatened that an obscene video has been made with the petitioner in a compromising situation and if any report is moved, he will make the video viral in order to disrepute her in the society. It is alleged that she was seduced by the petitioner on the false pretext that he will marry her. On the basis of the said report, the afore-mentioned FIR got registered and investigation in the matter is underway.  Arguments  The counsel for the petitioner submitted that even if the allegations as leveled in the FIR are taken on their face value or in their entirety, no case of rape as defined under Section 375 and 376 IPC is made out since the complainant is a grown up lady, aged of 24 years and a literate one, who is serving as a constable and knows her good and bad pretty well. If as per allegations, she submitted herself before the accused petitioner, then it could be presumed that it was a consensual sexual relationship between two major persons and the same would not fall under the penal provisions of Section 376 IPC. Thus, he prayed for quashing of the FIR and all consequential proceedings pending against the petitioner.  The Public Prosecutor for the State submitted that there are no grounds for quashing the FIR. From the bare perusal of FIR, commission of cognizable offence is disclosed which requires investigation. It is submitted that at the stage of quashing of FIR, the appreciation of evidence is not required to be made nor the High Court is supposed to make an enquiry to ascertain the reliability or genuineness of the case as alleged in the FIR. It was submitted that it is a clear case of seducement on account of false promise to marry the young girl, therefore, jointly prayed for dismissal of the petitions.  Adv. Mohit Balwada with Adv.Asha Sharma & Adv. Gayatri appeared for the petitioner while Adv. Anshuman Saxena and Adv. Ramesh Chaudhary, PP appeared for the respondents.  Case Title: Radhakrishan Meena v. State Of Rajasthan, Through P.P    
The Fast Track Special Court (POCSO), Thiruvananthapuram has convicted a 63 year old man to 7 years imprisonment under the Section 9(m) r/w 10 of the POCSO Act, 2012 for sexually assaulting his 9 year old neighbour in the year 2014. The incident was disclosed 6 years later when the victim confided in her school counsellor. The Court found the delay of 6 years in registration of the FIR had been satisfactorily explained by the prosecution, and accepted the same.  "Researches and studies show that there are numerous reasons why a child or even a grown up adult may not disclose about a sexual assault and it may linger at the bottom of their heart as their dirty, scary secret, but they open up or disclose it to someone they find they can confide in or someone whom they trust will listen to them and not judge them etc. In the instant case, according to PW1 she was afraid of the incident and also not aware of the nature of the event that occurred to her. Her subsequent reluctance to visit the house of the accused also shows that she had distanced herself from (the accused) after the incident, which unfortunately her parents failed to notice earlier. Many such factors contribute to non-disclosure of sexual assault by children", the Special Judge Aaj Sudarshan observed while convicting the accused. It therefore ascertained that the delay of 6 years in lodging the FIR could not be considered as fatal to the prosecution when the victim had explained the reasons which had also acquired the confidence of the Court.  The Prosecution case was that the accused had sexually assaulted the victim when she was 9 years old, and residing with her grandparents. The accused was the victim's neighbour, and his family was to the family of the victim. The incident allegedly took place when the victim had sought the help of the neighbours including that of the accused on the instructions of her grandmother, after her grandfather developed discomfort in the chest. The accused had instructed his wife to take the victim to their house when the latter's grandfather was taken to the hospital, and it was there that the assault took place.  The incident came to light when the victim disclosed the event to her school counsellor, after her mother took her for counselling on January 6, 2020, due to her exhibiting behavioural disorders, laziness, lack of interest in studying, loss of appetite, and so on.  It was submitted by the Public Prosecutor R.S. Vijay Mohan that after the incident, the accused used to run away whenever he saw the victim, which was indicative of his guilt or shame. "The reason given by PW1 that she was afraid to disclose the incident to anyone soon after the incident can be because of many factors as understood from the evidence adduced like, the close relationship of her family with the family of the accused, she was residing with aged grandparents and not with her parents which must have resulted in mental agony to a small child of 9 years while her brother got to live with her parents, living with grandparents and living away from parents must have created an emotional and mental distance in her mind with her parents, non-awareness of what actually took place on the night of 01/01/2014, her fear on re-visiting the incident which she described as near death experience, lack of close friends at school, and so on", it was further submitted.  It was argued by the defense counsel Advocate Biju S.S. that it was a false case preferred on the instigation of the maternal aunt of the victim. It was contended that there had been a civil dispute with respect to a pathway between her maternal aunt and the accused. It was argued that otherwise, the victim, who was a brilliant and bright child who had come to know about sexual abuse while studying in Class 4 would have disclosed the same when it had occurred. It was thus contended that the accused had been falsely implicated in this case.  The Court in this case was of the opinion that the delay of 6 years in registration of FIR had been well explained by the prosecution in the circumstances.  "...it is to be borne in mind that no girl wishes to falsely implicate a man in a case stating that the man had sexually assaulted her. The delay in disclosing the unfortunate event to anyone causing delay of 6 years in registering Ext P18 FIR is well explained by PW1", it observed.  The Court also relied on the Apex Court decision in Tulsidas Kanolkar v. State of Goa (2003), to emphasize that delay in lodging the FIR cannot be used as a ritualistic formula for discarding the prosecution case and doubting its authenticity.  "In the instant case, PW1 was afraid to disclose the incident and was also unaware of the catastrophe which had befallen on her. So, the delay in lodging Ext P18 FIR does not in any way render the prosecution version brittle", it held.  The Court further took note of the victim's statement that she was unaware of any civil dispute between her maternal aunt and the accused.  "That apart, it may be noted that hardly any family member would fit a person in a POCSO case to take revenge by risking the future and honour of their child. Not all people are hard hearted to bring dishonour to their child. Life of a female child ends when a false accusation is levelled by her against a person only to take revenge on him", the Court observed.  Having found that the prosecution had thus proved the sexual assault through the evidences submitted, the Court thus convicted the accused. It sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 7 years and to pay a fine of Rs.25,000/-. In default of payment of the fine amount, the accused was directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of 6 months. The Court added that in case the fine amount was realized, it would have to be be given to the victim as compensation.  "The accused is entitled to get set off on the substantive sentence for the period from 23/01/2020 till 11/02/2020 the period he had undergone detention as an under trial prisoner", it added.  Case Title: State v. Sundaresan Nair  
The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently quashed a rape case against a man registered at the instance of his 'second wife' as the Court noted that it was a frivolous case and her version indicated false allegations against the man. The Bench of Justice Anand Pathak observed that it was vexatious and frivolous litigation just to exert pressure on the man to extract money or an attempt made by the prosecutrix ('second wife') to convert domestic dispute into criminal allegations. The Case in brief Essentially, the 41-year-old respondent No.2/complainant/prosecutrix lodged an FIR against 55-year-old Manohar Silawat (Applicant/Petitioner) alleging that she was raped by him in the month of May 2001 and as a result whereof, she became pregnant and out of such relation, one child was born.  It was further alleged that thereafter, he used to have physical relationship with her continuously and he used to call her for intermittent payments towards her maintenance amount and used to commit rape, and threatened her with dire consequences.  On the other hand, challenging the FIR registered against himself and consequential criminal proceedings arising out of the case under Sections 376, 506 of IPC, the petitioner moved the instant Section 482 CrPC. The Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the complainant and the petitioner, both belong to Scheduled Caste and as per their customs, between them, Natra (social customs like live-in/marriage) was performed in which, with the consent of his first wife, the petitioner lived with both of his wives. It was his further case that when despite the instance of the prosecutrix, the petitioner did not part his whole property in favor of the prosecutrix, then these false allegations have been leveled against him. The Counsel also referred to an application made by the complainant/alleged victim under Section 125 of Cr.P.C.before Principal Judge, Family Court, Gwalior seeking maintenance from the petitioner alleging that she is his wife and in July 2019, she was removed by him from his family household. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the prosecutrix had lived with the petitioner and in fact blessed with a boy namely Harsh (now almost 20 years old) and after 18 years, she had filed a complaint on which case has been registered against the petitioner. Finding her case to be unbelievable, the Court further observed thus: "When petitioner and prosecutrix lived together as a couple for 18 long years then after such lapse of time any allegation levelled by prosecutrix pales into oblivion because they are primarily motivated to exert pressure. Not only this, perusal of application under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. filed at the instance of respondent No.2 further reveals that on the one hand she levelled the allegations that they lived in live-in relationship but now she makes an application that they lived as married couple. Such divergent stand can only be availed of in case of misrepresentation of facts" Consequently, the Court opined that It would be a miscarriage of justice if such false allegations are allowed to sustain and the petitioner is unnecessarily dragged into litigation to defend himself. Therefore, the Court quashed the FIR and entire criminal proceedings and allowed the petitioner's plea. Case title - Manohar Silawat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh

The Delhi High Court on Monday held that Section 3 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007 cannot be deployed to override and nullify other protections in law particularly a women's "right to a shared household" under Section 17 of the DV Act.  Justice Asha Menon added that the factual situation has to be assessed on a prima facie evaluation before directing the eviction of the daughter-in-law from what she describes as her 'shared household'. The Court was dealing with a petition filed by a daughter in law challenging a Sessions Court order in a suit filed by her father in law again her for evicting of the matrimonial property. The Trial Court had vide impugned order dated 19th April, 2021 passed various directions on the application filed by the father in law under Section 19(1)(f) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The Trial Court had directed the respondents to pay the petitioner two months' advance rental amount in order to enable her to take on rent a suitable accommodation for herself and also directed her to vacate the suit property within 40 days from the date of first payment.  It was the case of the petitioner that she and her husband were married in the year 1995, and she started living on the first floor of the suit premises since then. Thereafter the husband had filed a divorce petition in 2014. According to the petitioner, it was claimed that an effort was made to somehow throw her out of her matrimonial home.  It was thus argued on behalf of the petitioner that the trial court could not have directed her eviction from the suit premises, where she had been residing for about twenty years. It was also submitted that even if the suit premises belonged to the father-in-law since it was a shared household, she could not be evicted without proper adjudication of facts.  "Significantly, it is for the learned Trial Court to determine the nature of relationship between the parties and to permit eviction, if the relationship was acrimonious. The learned Trial Court was also to ascertain, whether the daughter-in-law was residing in a joint family. This was to be during the subsistence of the matrimonial life. But the learned Trial Court has not dealt with these aspects at all as it felt bound to call for the application from the respondents and issue an eviction order forthwith. Important facts have been overlooked," the Court observed at the outset.  The Court also added that the judgment of the Supreme Court in S Vanitha vs. Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District [Civil Appeal No. 3822 of 2020] needs to be taken into account by the Courts while balancing the rights of the daughter-in-law and the senior citizens. Observing so, the Court said: "Therefore, in the event of a composite dispute where the suit premises is a site of contestation between the two groups protected by the law, appropriately moulded reliefs qua both the sides ought to be granted. Section 3 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007 cannot be deployed to override and nullify other protections in law particularly that of a women's "right to a shared household" under Section 17 of the DV Act." "In other words, the fact situation had to be assessed at least on a prima facie evaluation before directing the eviction of the daughter-in-law from what she describes is her 'shared household'. It bears repetition that the Supreme Court has held that what constitutes a shared household is a matter of evidence." On the facts of the case, the Court noted that the Trial Court had not come to a cogent conclusion that the relationship between the parties was acrimonious and that it had also overlooked the interim injunction which was still in force against the petitioner which she had clearly not violated. Taking note of the fact that the Trial Court had not given thought to this question of shared household even perfunctorily, the Court said that there is an the obligation on the Trial Court to weigh all circumstances before directing eviction of the daughter-in-law being an onerous one has not been duly discharged.  "It cannot be overlooked that the impugned order was passed on 19th April, 2021 when Delhi was at the peak of the second wave of Covid-19. The hospitals were overflowing with patients and no family had remained untouched by the mayhem caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, it left the petitioner to search for herself and take some premises on rent," the Court said.  The Court also said that while jurisdiction under Article 227 cannot be exercised as if the Court is an Appellate Court, it was observed that in cases where the Trial Court overlooks significant facts and considers irrelevant facts, the High Court in its supervisory jurisdiction would interfere with a decision of a Trial Court, especially in the event the orders appear to be perverse and unreasonable. "The directions issued to the petitioner to shift out to a rented accommodation were most unwarranted," the Court concluded.  Accordingly, the Court allowed the petition and set aside the impugned order. The Allahabad High Court recently made it clear that the wife cannot be ousted from her matrimonial home on the basis of the summary proceedings under the Senior Citizens Act, 2007. With this, the Bench of Justice Vivek Chaudhary came to the aid of a widow by setting aside an eviction order passed against her and her son from her in-laws' house. Essentially, the Court referred to the December 2020 ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of S Vanitha vs. Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District [Civil Appeal No. 3822 of 2020], to hold thus: "Senior Citizens, Act, 2007 and PWDV Act, 2005 are to be read simultaneously and a wife cannot be ousted from her matrimonial home on the basis of the summary proceedings under the Senior Citizens Act, 2007" Title: SNEHA AHUJA v.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has recently observed that compelling a married woman to live in her parental home after marriage amounts to cruelty and that for this reason, it cannot be said that she was living seperately without reasonable reason. The development came from a single judge bench comprising of Justice GS Ahluwalia who was dealing with a criminal revision petition challenging the Family Court's order directing the husband to pay Rs.7,000/- per month to wife under sec. 125 CrPC. An application for maintenance was filed by the respondent wife on the ground that she was harrassed and beaten by her husband and in laws for the demand of dowry after which she was ousted from her matrimonial house and started residing in her parental home seven months prior to the filing of the said application. It was also the wife's case that in the meantime, neither the husband nor the in laws made any efforts to bring her back. On the other hand, it was the case of the husband that the wife had resided in her matrimonial house for a period of four days and that she never allowed him to consummate the marriage and had allegedly questioned his potency. Further submitting that they were acquitted for the offence under sec. 498A IPC, it was submitted by the husband that he was disrespected when he had gone to the parental home of his wife for taking her back. The Family Court had reasoned that it cannot be said that the wife was residing separately without any reasonable reason and had also found that the she was unable to maintain herself as she wasn't doing any work. Challenging the said order, it was submitted by the husband that Rs. 7000 maintenance amount per month was on a higher side as he was a student working part time in a shop.  Considering the facts of the case, the High Court observed thus: "Under these circumstances, this Court of the considered opinion that after having levelled serious allegations against her and her parents and having failed to prove the same, it cannot be said that the respondent is residing separately without any reasonable reason." Furthermore, it said: "Thus, it is also clear that the applicant (husband) has deserted the respondent (wife) and he cannot take advantage of his own wrong. Further, compelling a married women to live in her parental home, is also a cruelty. Accordingly, it is held that it cannot be said that the respondent is residing separately without any reasonable reason." Affirming the order passed by the Family Court, the Court ordered thus: "It appears that by order dated 06/02/2019, Court had below awarded an amount of Rs.3,000/- by way of interim maintenance. Accordingly, it is directed that the amount paid by the applicant by way of interim maintenance is liable to be adjust in the arrears of maintenance amount." The petition was accordingly dismissed.

The Karnataka High Court has said that the state government order, providing that in case eligible women applicants under a reserved category post are not available, such posts could be filled up by eligible male candidates of the same category is applicable to recruitment notifications issued under the General Recruitment Rules or recruitment as regards backlog vacancies under the Special Recruitment Rules.  A single judge bench of Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav allowed the petition filed by Dyavappa, and directed the Bangalore University to take note of the Government Order dated 22-11-2002 and proceed forthwith to make an order of appointment. The said process is to be completed within a period of three months.   The University had invited applications for recruitment as per the Notification dated 21.03.2018. Insofar as recruitment to the Open category is concerned, recruitment was completed. However, the recruitment for the category of ST (W) could not be concluded as no candidates had applied for the post earmarked for the particular category.   The petitioner came to know regarding non-submission of application with respect to the post of Assistant Professor (Women) under the category of ST by virtue of the communication of the Bangalore University and soon thereafter he made a representation for appointment to the said post.   Following which he approached the court seeking directions to the University to consider the representation made by him and direct the respondents to issue an order of appointment to the post of Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture in Bangalore University as regards the vacant post under the category ST (Women).   Senior Advocate A.G.Shivanna appearing for the petitioner submitted that subsequent notification by the University does not make any provision for filling of this post as notified on 14.06.2021. In terms of Section 53 (8) of the Karnataka State Universities Act, the Board of appointment shall follow the orders issued by the State Government from time to time and the GO must be construed to be an order issued by the State Government in terms of Section 53 (8) of the Karnataka State Universities Act.   Further, he argued that the vertical reservation is the category of ST while the horizontal reservation is that of woman and taking note of the applicable Government Order, in the event suitable woman candidate as regards vertical reservation of ST is not found, in terms of the Government Order, if the horizontal reservation is shifted to the men, there would be no prejudice that would be caused to the vertical reservation.  The government advocate said the Order dated 22.11.2002, is required to be adhered to by the appointing authority 'in all the cadres'. Further, sub-rule (1B) of Rule 9 of the Karnataka Civil Service (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977, points out that vacancies set apart to the extent of 33% shall be filled up from amongst the category of General Merit, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and each of the categories among the other backward classes by women. The said Recruitment Rule has a proviso which states that if sufficient number of eligible women candidates are not available, to the extent of thirty-three percent, the unfilled vacancies shall be filled by men candidates belonging to the same category.   Advocate Rajendrakumar Sungay appearing for the University contended that the Government Order is not applicable insofar as the present recruitment notification is in terms of the Karnataka State Civil Services (Unfilled vacancies reserved for the persons belonging to the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled tribes) (Special Recruitment) Rules, 2001 and also the Karnataka State Civil Services (Unfilled vacancies reserved for the persons belonging to the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled Tribes) (Special Recruitment) (First Amendment) Rules 2002.   Findings  The bench said,  "As per Recruitment Notification the post of Assistant Professor of Department of Architecture is to be filled up under the main Category of vertical reservation of Scheduled Tribe (ST) and horizontal reservation as regards one post with respect to women and the other post is reserved 'Open' for the same category. It is accordingly to be construed that the vertical reservation is of ST while horizontal reservation is as regards category of women."   It added,  "The Government Order as rightly contended by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner is to be treated to be a direction of the State Government under Section 53 (8) of the Karnataka State Universities Act, 2000."   Rejecting the contention of the University that the Government Order is not applicable insofar as recruitment under the Special Recruitment Rules is concerned, the bench said,  "The Government Order does not make any such distinction and would be applicable whether it is recruitment under the General Recruitment Rules or Recruitment as regards backlog vacancies under the Special Recruitment Rules. The direction under the notification at Annexure-'H' being a direction under Section 53 (8) requires to be accepted by the University."   Further the court said recruitment to other posts having been completed and as contended by the petitioner a subsequent notification for recruitment also having been made, there is no notification for recruitment as regards category of ST (Women).   Following which it said , "If that being so, non-filling of the post for ST under the vertical reservation of ST by other eligible women or in the absence by men would prejudice the rights of those under ST Category. Wherever the horizontal reservation of eligible candidates are not found and as provided under the recruitment Rule 9 (b) referred to above as well as Government Order at Annexure-'H', it is the duty of the authorities concerned to then have a vertical reservation filled in terms of the Government Order by ST (Women)."

The Supreme Court observed that a party in whose favour a court has decreed the suit can challenge an adverse finding before the appellate court without a cross objection. It is not necessary that a challenge to the adverse findings of the lower court needs to be made in the form of a memorandum of cross-objection, the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed. The Court also observed that it can entertain new grounds raised for the first time in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence. In this case, the Trial Court dismissed a suit though it rejected the defendant's objection regarding lack of jurisdiction of the Trial Court. The High Court allowed the appeal by the plaintiff and reversed the judgment of the Trial Court. It was held that the auction conducted by Moradabad Development Authority in respect of the land in dispute is null and void. The question of jurisdiction was not considered by the High Court because he did not file a cross-objection against this finding of the Trial Court on the exercise of its jurisdiction. Saurav Jain, the defendant- auction purchaser who purchased the suit land from the MDA, approached the Apex court in appeal. He contended that the jurisdiction of the civil court is impliedly excluded under the provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976. Referring to Order XLI Rule 22 of the CPC, it was contended that a party, in whose favour the civil court has decreed a suit, can raise arguments against findings without having to file a cross- objection, in the appeal. Addressing these contentions, the bench discussed the history and scope of Order XLI Rule 22(1). "25 It is apparent from the amended provisions of Order XLI Rule 22 CPC and the above authorities that there are two changes that were brought by the 1976 amendment. First, the scope of filing of a cross-objection was enhanced substantively to include objections against 'findings' of the lower court; second,  different forms of raising cross-objections were recognised. The amendment sought to introduce different forms of cross-objection for assailing the findings and decrees since the amendment separates the phrase "but may also state that the finding against him in the Court below in respect of any issue ought to have been in his favour" from "may also take any cross-objection to the decree" with a semi colon. Therefore, the two parts of the sentence must be read disjunctively. Only when a part of the decree has been assailed by the respondent, should a memorandum of cross-objection be filed. Otherwise, it is sufficient to raise a challenge to an adverse finding of the court of first instance before the appellate court without a cross objection." The court then discussed the applicability of the principle in Order XLI Rule 22 CPC to proceedings before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution "The principle stipulated in Order XLI Rule 22 of CPC can be applied to petitions under Article 136 of the Constitution because of this Court's wide powers to do justice under Article 142 of the Constitution. Since the principle in Order XLI Rule 22 of the CPC furthers the cause of justice by providing the party other than the 'aggrieved party' to raise any adverse findings against them, this Court can draw colour from Order XLI Rule 22 CPC and permit objections to findings.", the bench observed. The bench noted that the ground of jurisdiction was only raised by the appellant before the Trial Court and not before the High Court.  However, referring to earlier judgments, the bench said that the plea of a bar or lack of jurisdiction can be entertained at any stage, since an order or decree passed without jurisdiction is nonest in law. Thus, considering the case on merits, the bench held that ULCRA impliedly excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court on matters arising out of the ceiling proceeding. "Though the appellant did not assail the finding of the Trial Court on the issue of jurisdiction before the High Court under Order XLI Rule 22 CPC either by filing a memorandum of cross-objection or otherwise, he is not precluded from raising the argument before this Court. This Court in view of its plenary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution read with its power to do complete justice under Article 142, can entertain new grounds raised for the first time if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence, specifically one concerning jurisdiction of the court which goes to the root of the matter.", the court said while disposing the appeal.     
The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently set aside an order of preventive detention on the ground that the detenu was not given an opportunity to submit a representation before the detaining authority, which was in violation of his fundamental rights under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently set aside an order of preventive detention on the ground that the detenu was not given an opportunity to submit a representation before the detaining authority, which was in violation of his fundamental rights under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India.  The division bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice M.S. Bhatti was essentially dealing with a writ petition filed by the Petitioner, wherein he was seeking directions of the Court to quash the order of his detention, passed by the District Magistrate pursuant to his power under Section 3 of the Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980.  The Petitioner argued that as per his detention order, he was granted an opportunity to submit a representation before the State Government. However, he wasn't given a chance to do the same before the Detaining Authority. Placing reliance on the decision of a Full Bench of the Court in Kamal Khare v. State of M.P., the Petitioner submitted that this communication by the District Magistrate was bad in the eye of law.  The Petitioner also asserted that Article 22(5) of the Constitution specifically provides that in a case of detention, the authority passing order of detention is obliged to afford an opportunity to the person concerned to make a representation to the authority which has passed the order of detention.  Per contra, the State submitted that the Petitioner was granted opportunity to submit his representation before the State Government and therefore, there was no violation of any statutory provisions.  Examining its decision in Kamal Khare case along with the facts of the case, the Court found merit in the arguments put forth by the Petitioner-  The aforesaid directives of the Full Bench makes it unequivocally clear that the authority passing an order of detention is obliged/duty bound to afford opportunity of hearing to the detainee to make a representation against the order of detention. Apparently in the present case, no such opportunity was granted to the petitioner to submit a representation before the Detaining Authority. However, on the contrary, an opportunity was given to submit a representation before the State Government, however, this was not proper particularly in view of the law laid down by the Full Bench in the case of Kamal Khare (supra).  With the aforesaid observations, the Court quashed the impugned order of detention and granted liberty to the District Magistrate to proceed against the Petitioner under the Essential Commodities Act and the orders framed thereunder.

The Supreme Court of India has observed that where a Court while considering an application for bail fails to consider the relevant factors, an Appellate Court may justifiably set aside the order granting bail. According to the Bench, the Appellate Court is required to consider whether the order granting bail suffers from a non­-application of mind or a prima facie view from the evidence available on record.  A Bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice Sanjiv Khanna made the observation while considering an appeal challenging the Delhi High Court's order granting bail to a person accused of engaging in the business of multi­commodity trading of agricultural and non­- commodities agricultural and for the offences under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B IPC.  The Bench has held that the High Court's order is unsustainable as the High Court while releasing the accused respondent on bail has not exercised the jurisdiction judiciously and has not considered the relevant factors which are required to be considered while grant of bail. The Bench observed that it appears that the High Court has directed to release the accused on bail mainly on the ground that the case arises out of a commercial transaction and is based on documents already seized However, all allegations and the material collected during the course of the investigation which are part of the charge­sheet and supplementary charge­ sheet were not taken note of by the High Court. Further, the High Court has not at all taken note of the reasoning given by the the Sessions Court while rejecting the bail application of accused. The Court has observed that the High Court has completely lost sight of the basic principles enumerated by the Supreme Court through various decisions.  The Bench has pointed out that the High Court has not at all considered the modus operandi adopted by the accused in commission of serious offence of siphoning and/or transferring the huge sum to another company through shell companies. Further, the High Court has also not taken into consideration the status report filed by the I.O. in which in detail it has been pointed out how systematically the accused have committed the offence and misappropriated/siphoned off the huge sum through shell companies. The Bench further observed that the High Court has not at all considered the relevant factors including the nature and gravity of accusation; the modus operandi and the manner in which the offences have been committed through shell companies and creating the false/forged documents and/or misusing the PAN Cards, Aadhar Cards and KYCs of the employees and showing them as Directors of the fake and shell companies. The Bench relied on Supreme Court's judgement in the case of Mahipal vs. Rajesh Kumar alias Polia and Another, (2020) where it was held that though the Court does not ordinarily interfere with the order of the High Court granting bail, however, where the discretion of the High Court to grant bail has been exercised without due application of mind and in contravention of the directions of this Court, such an order of granting bail is liable to be set aside. The Bench also relied on the case of Neeru Yadav vs. State of UP & Anr., (2016) where Supreme Court had laid down the factors to be considered by the Court while dealing with an application for grant of bail. The Bench therefore concluded that the High Court has not adverted to the relevant considerations and has granted the bail mechanically by observing that the case arises out of a commercial transaction. The Court has quashed and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court the respondent accused on bail deserves and directed the accused to surrender before the concerned Court/Jail Authority forthwith.

The Gujarat High Court recently delved into the 'Test of Sameness' and the 'Test of Consequence' that are relevant while determining the legality of a 'second FIR'. Second FIR or successive FIR in respect of the same incident or crime is not permissible in law. However, to determine whether the second impugned FIR is based on the same offence and arises out of a different transaction, the above two tests may be applied. In the instant case pertaining to two FIRs registered against the Managing Director of the Gujarat State Land Development Corporation under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, Justice Gita Gopi also propounded the requirements of proving an offence under Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act. Test of Sameness The Supreme Court in Babubhai and Ors. Vs. State of Gujarat explained that the test of sameness is to be applied to find out whether both the FIRs relate to the same incident in respect of the same occurrence or are in regard to the incidents which are two or more parts of the same transaction.  If the answer is affirmative, the second FIR is liable to be quashed; however, in case, the contrary is proved, where the version in the second FIR is different and they are in respect of the two different incidents/crimes, the second FIR is permissible. In Anju Chaudhary Vs. State of U.P. and Ors. it was explained that where the incident is separate, offences are similar or different, or even where the subsequent crime is of such magnitude that it does not fall within the ambit and scope of the FIR recorded first, then a second FIR can be registered. "So, when the version of second FIR is different, and when in respect of same incident the accused in the first FIR comes forward with a different version or counterclaim, investigation on both the FIRs has to be conducted," Justice Gopi held. Test of Consequence In Amitbhai Anilchandra Shah Vs. Central Bureau Of Investigation And Anr., the Consequence Test was explained thus: if an offence forming part of the second FIR arises as a consequence of the offence alleged in the first FIR, then offences covered by both the FIRs are the same and accordingly, the second FIR will be impermissible in law. It was held that the offences covered in both the FIRs shall have to be treated as a part of the first FIR. Furthermore, merely because two separate complaints had been lodged does not mean that they could not be clubbed together and one charge-sheet could not be filed.  Background  The Petitioner, an Accused, filed a Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution to seek the quashment of a 2018 FIR under Section 482 of CrPC for offences under Section 13(1)(e) and 13(2) of the PC Act.   Basis an intelligence report against the officers of GSLDC of receiving commission and bribes and a consequent raid, an FIR was registered under Sections 8,10 and 13(2) of the PC Act. The Petitioner was registered as Accused No. 2 in this FIR. While chargesheet was filed in the first FIR, another FIR was also filed with the same set of allegations against the Petitioner.  The Petitioner contends that the second FIR is a repetition of the investigation which has taken place in the first FIR where chargesheet has already been filed. Registration of another FIR within 3 days of the first FIR with the same set of allegations is an abuse of law and hence, the FIR deserves to be quashed. The Respondent contended that the first FIR was registered in connection with the raid conducted and the events which unfolded during the whole search. However, the second FIR was registered under Sections 13(1)(e) and 13(2) of the PC Act with regard to the possession of cash and gold articles by the Petitioner.  Judgement  After applying the 'Test of Sameness' and the 'Test of Consequence', the Court came to a conclusion that the second FIR was not the consequence of the offence alleged in the first FIR and therefore, the second FIR could not have been clubbed with the first FIR. The Court noted that the accused in the first FIR, one KC Parmar, was asked about the money found from the drawer of his table and he put up a claim that he was collecting the money on behalf of the Petitioner. So on that version of co-accused, the first FIR was registered. So far as the second FIR is concerned, the same pertained to unaccounted money and gold article found in the possession of the petitioner. "It was not the say of the petitioner that it was the money given to him by coaccused, K.C. Parmar, or that from the money so given to him, he had purchased the gold pendant and earring," the Court further added concluding that the two incidents are distinct and two different FIRs have been rightly registered. The Court also concluded that the first FIR was registered against the Petitioner along with the co-accused. While the second FIR was registered against the Petitioner as a public servant who could not satisfactorily account for his pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income.  While explaining this distinction, the Court laid down the ingredients of the offence under Section 13(1)(e), namely:  the prosecution must prove that the accused is a public servant,the nature and extent of the pecuniary resources or property which are found in his possession, it must be proved as to what were his known sources of income i.e. known to the prosecution and,it must prove quite objectively that the resources or property found in possession of the accused were disproportionate to his known source of income.  Accordingly, the Bench dismissed the Petition.  Case Title: Kanaiyalal Sundarji Detroja vs State of Gujarat  Case No.: R/SCR.A/7756/2020          
The Supreme Court observed that a Prime Minister or the Chief Minister does not have disciplinary control over the members of the Council of Ministers. The Constitution Bench made this observation while holding that a statement made by a Minister, even if traceable to any affairs of the State or for protecting the Government, cannot be attributed vicariously to the Government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility. In this regard, Advocate Kaleeswaram Raj had made a suggestion that the Prime Minister, in the case of a Minister of the Union of India and the Chief Minister, in the case of a Minister of the State should be allowed to take appropriate action, against the erring Minister. The Court rejected this suggestion as "fanciful". "The Prime Minister or the Chief Minister does not have disciplinary control over the members of the Council of Ministers. It is true that in practice, a strong Prime Minister or Chief Minister will be able to drop any Minister out of the Cabinet. But in a country like ours where there is a multi­party system and where coalition Governments are often formed, it is not possible at all times for a Prime Minister/Chief Minister to take the whip, whenever a statement is made by someone in the Council of Ministers...Governments which survive on wafer­thin majority (of which we have seen quite a bit), sometimes have individual Ministers who are strong enough to decide the very survival of such Governments. This problem is not unique to our country.", the majority judgment authored by Justice V. Ramasubramanian reads. The court further, referring to various authorities, noted that (i) that the concept of collective responsibility is essentially a political concept; (ii) that the collective responsibility is that of the Council of Ministers; and (iii) that such collective responsibility is to the House of the People/Legislative Assembly of the State. Generally, such responsibility correlates to (i) the decisions taken; and (ii) the acts of omission and commission done. It is not possible to extend this concept of collective responsibility to any and every statement orally made by a Minister outside the House of the People/Legislative Assembly. "As all the literature on the issue shows, collective responsibility is that of the Council of Ministers. Each individual Minister is responsible for the decisions taken collectively by the Council of Ministers. In other words, the flow of stream in collective responsibility is from the Council of Ministers to the individual Ministers. The flow is not on the reverse, namely, from the individual Ministers to the Council of Ministers"...

Headnotes Statement Made By A Minister - Constitutional Tort - Collective Responsibility - A statement made by a Minister even if traceable to any affairs of the State or for protecting the Government, cannot be attributed vicariously to the Government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility - A mere statement made by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under PartIII of the Constitution, may not constitute a violation of the constitutional rights and become actionable as Constitutional tort. But if as a consequence of such a statement, any act of omission or commission is done by the officers resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, then the same may be actionable as a constitutional tort.

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior Bench recently held that conducting a preliminary enquiry is not sine qua non for issuing a direction for prosecution U/S 195 CRPC and that the Applicant is not entitled for any opportunity of hearing prior to that.

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior Bench recently held that conducting a preliminary enquiry is not sine qua non for issuing a direction for prosecution U/S 195 CRPC and that the Applicant is not entitled for any opportunity of hearing prior to that.  The single bench of Justice G.S. Ahluwalia was essentially dealing with a Criminal Revision against the order of the Additional Sessions Judge, wherein the appeal preferred by the Applicant against the dismissal of his application U/S 340 CRPC before Judicial Magistrate of First Class was rejected.   Brief facts of the case are that the Applicant was a seizure witness in a criminal case. During his examination before the trial court, he changed his stance on multiple occasions, thereby intentionally weakening the prosecution's case. The trial court, while passing the judgment, also directed that since the Applicant had intentionally changed his version, a complaint be filed under Section 340 CRPC for his prosecution under Section 195 IPC. Accordingly, a complaint was filed and an objection was raised by the Applicant by filing an application under Section 340 CRPC, submitting that since no preliminary enquiry was conducted, the complaint was not maintainable. The said application was rejected by JFMC, and an appeal preferred against the same by the Applicant was also dismissed by the ADJ.  The Applicant's arguments were twofold: In the absence of preliminary enquiry, the direction to file complaint should not have been given. Further, the prosecution of every witness is not necessary merely on the ground that he has not supported the prosecution case.  Examining the decision of the Apex Court in Pritish v. State of Maharashtra & Ors., the Court observed-  Thus, where the Court is of the prima facie opinion that it is in the interest of justice to proceed against the witness for giving a false evidence, then holding of preliminary enquiry is not warranted. So far as the question of giving opportunity of hearing to the applicant before directing for his prosecution under Section 195 of CrPC, the said question is also no more res integra … the holding of preliminary enquiry is not sine qua non for issuing a direction for prosecution under Section 195 of CrPC and even the applicant is not entitled for any opportunity of hearing prior to that.  The Court further noted that the Applicant was a member of Gram Raksha Samiti. He had certain statutory duties to follow. During the course of his evidence, he changed his version at every stage. Thus, this conduct of the Applicant was clearly indicative of the fact that the he had deliberately changed his version in order to help the accused. The Court held-   Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, coupled with the fact that the applicant is the member of Gram Raksha Samiti and has statutory duties to discharge and he deliberately changed his version with regard to the place from where the amount of Rs.80,000/- was seized from the accused Ramkumar, this Court is of the considered opinion that the Trial Court did not commit any mistake by directing to file a complaint for prosecution of the applicant. Furthermore, the Trial Magistrate did not commit any mistake by rejecting the application filed under Section 340 of CrPC.   Affirming the decision of the ADJ and the JFMC, the court directed the lower court to proceed further with the case and make every endeavour to conclude the trial within a period of one year. If further added that if the Applicant did not cooperate in the matter, the court below shall be free to take coercive action against him for ensuring the early disposal of the trial. The revision was accordingly dismissed.   Case Title: Laxman Rao Vs. Court of Third Additional Sessions Judge, Guna and anr. Case citation:  (MP) 26

In a significant ruling, the Kerala High Court on Thursday drew up a set of guidelines to be considered by criminal courts while granting permission for the issuance of passports to individuals involved in criminal proceedings. Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas while disposing of a petition filed by a man who was awaiting issuance of a new passport for the past 5 years, observed: "The grant of permission by the Magistrate enabling an accused to travel abroad will be of great significance, especially since it will be a process of balancing the fundamental right of a citizen to travel abroad and the need to ensure the presence of the accused during trial." The Court further noted that it is important to lay down parameters so that the decision can be taken in an objective manner.  "Many a time, the consideration results in subjective satisfaction of the Magistrate rather than the required objective satisfaction. To avoid subjectivity, it is necessary to lay down the parameters that can govern the grant of permission for future guidance."  Factual Background:  The petitioner had lost his passport issued from Dubai while he was in Kerala. Although he immediately applied for a new passport, a case was registered against him for offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code and the Passport Act, 1967. Thereafter, the petitioner was informed from the passport office that due to the adverse report on the pendency of the crime, the file for issuance of the passport was closed. Almost five years later, he applied again for a new passport. The criminal case against him was still pending investigation even then. Key Observations:  The Court recalled the cardinal legal principle that an accused must be presumed innocent until proven guilty and that false prosecution can adversely affect citizens' future. The Bench did not hesitate to comment on the delay in completion of criminal trials: "This Court cannot also lose sight of the fact that criminal trials in our country take ages to complete, notwithstanding the efforts at reducing delay. Adding to all these, with the Covid-19 pandemic having halted the continuity of trials in many trial courts, further delay is a forgone conclusion and to say the least."  As such, it was found imperative to lay down a set of guidelines to be followed while governing the grant of permission by the criminal courts for issuing passports to individuals involved in pending criminal proceedings.  Guidelines: The following are the criteria that decide if an individual should be issued with a passport while being involved in criminal proceedings: (1)The stage of the criminal proceeding and the duration of time within which the trial may take place; (2) The criminal antecedents and past conduct of the accused; (3) The nature and gravity of the crime; offences under Statutes dealing with acts of terrorism and acts of smuggling should require a different consideration; (4) In heinous crimes, if the court decides to grant permission,the period for which permission is granted can be limited; (5) Chances of the accused fleeing or evading the trial in the case; (6) Mode in which the presence of the accused can be ensured during trial, including stipulating conditions like providing the address/ change of address in the country of residence abroad, either with the Indian Consulate at the country of residence abroad or with the Court where the trial is pending; (7) Since in cases where time is not fixed by the Magistrate while granting permission, the passport authorities are issuing passports only for one year, the period for which the accused can be permitted to travel can also be fixed by the Magistrate, while granting permission.  However, it was clarified that this was not an exhaustive list and that criminal courts may incorporate other reasonable safeguards to ensure the presence of the accused during the trial into the order granting permission if the circumstances warrant it. Tracing the advancement of the laws governing the right to travel, the Court found it indubitable that the right to travel beyond the frontiers of our country is a facet of personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Nevertheless, it added that however comprehensive the said liberty be, it is still subject to 'procedure established by law'. After the Passport Act was enacted in 1967, a law came into existence which enabled denial merely on the ground of existence of a criminal proceeding. However, the Government of India issued a notification, which is statutory in character, exempting citizens of India against whom criminal proceedings are pending before a criminal court from being denied passports on condition that the applicant produces orders from the court concerned permitting to depart from India. The Court found that there was still lacuna about the parameters that govern the grant of no objection by criminal courts. However, the Bench made it clear that it is for the legislation to fill the gaps in the existing system:  "It is for the legislature to fill up the lacuna by recourse to its rulemaking power or through proper amendments, such amendments have unfortunately not been forthcoming. It is essential that till then there must be some yardstick to govern the grant of such no objections by criminal courts as otherwise, there is a possibility of the grant of permission turning into a subjective satisfaction rather than an objective one." Advocate Saju S Nair appeared for the petitioner and the Central Government Counsel Jaishankar V Nair represented the respondents.  Case Title: Thadevoose Sebastian v.

The court was considering an appeal that arose from a specific performance suit in which the defendant pointed out that Bangalore Rules of Allotment, 1972 Rule 18(2) had an embargo against alienation for a period of ten years and therefore the contract is not lawful. The issue raised was whether the enforcement of an agreement to sell expressly or impliedly, lead to palpably defeat this Rule.  In this case, the Trial Court while refusing specific performance, directed the return of the amount paid by the plaintiff under the contract. Allowing the appeal, the High Court directed the defendants to execute the sale deed relating to the plaint schedule property in favour of the plaintiffs. In appeal filed by the defendants, the bench  comprising Justices KM Joseph and PS Narasimha noticed that in Union of India v. Col. L.S.N. Murthy (2012) 1 SCC 718, it was held that "the word "law" in the expression "defeat the provisions of any law" in Section 23 of the Contract Act is limited to the expressed terms of an Act of the legislature". "With respect, the principle laid down, does not commend itself to us. We do agree that the illegality cannot be a matter of conjecture nor the purpose divined by the Court from parliamentary debates.", the bench said. The court also noticed that in the said case, the Court was dealing with a Notification, which was, in fact, a 'letter' written by the Government of India. "What is contemplated under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act is law, in all its forms, being immunised from encroachment and infringement by a contract, being enforced. Not only would a Statutory Rule be law within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution of India but it would also be law under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act" The court also noticed that Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya AIR 1959 SC 781 and 'Pollock and Mullah' Commentary of Indian Contract Act and observed: "72. In regard to the Commentary by the very same Author, under the Second Head of "illegal object or consideration" in Section 23 of the Contract Act, viz., if the consideration or object is of such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, it is that, this Court took the view that law for the purpose of Section 23 would be, law made by the Legislature. Quite apart from the fact that what is involved in the said case was only a letter, the Judgment of this Court in Gherulal Parakh (supra) and the Commentary from the very same Author, was not noticed by this Court. Therefore, it becomes all the more reason as to why we need not refer the matter to a larger Bench. We may also notice that 'law', for the purposes of Clauses (1) and (2) cannot be different. It is very clear that Regulations or Orders made under the Authority derived from the Legislature referred to by this Court, are species of subordinate 95 legislation. Statutory Rules would also, therefore, clearly be law" In the instant case, the court found that, the contract was unenforceable for reason that it clearly, both expressly and impliedly, would defeat the object of the Rules, which are statutory in nature. Observing thus and considering other aspects of the case, the bench allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit for Specific Performance. The court, however,  directed payment of Rs.20,00,000/- by defendants to plaintiffs within a period of three months. "Having regard to the entirety of the evidence and the conduct of the parties, noticing even the admitted stand of the second defendant that the plaint schedule property has a value of Rs.2.5 crores and the plaintiff has paid, in all, a sum of Rs.50,000/, which constituted the consideration for the agreement to sell several years ago, while we dismiss the Suit for Specific Performance, we should direct the appellants to pay a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- in place of the Decree of the Trial Court.", the court said in this regard.       
The Allahabad High Court has observed that an accused gets an indefeasible right to 'default bail' if he makes an application after the maximum period for investigation of an offence is over, and before a charge sheet is filed. This assertion came from the bench of Justice Syed Aftab Husain Rizvi who held that an accused has an indefeasible right to 'default bail' under proviso to section... The Allahabad High Court has observed that an accused gets an indefeasible right to 'default bail' if he makes an application after the maximum period for investigation of an offence is over, and before a charge sheet is filed.  This assertion came from the bench of Justice Syed Aftab Husain Rizvi who held that an accused has an indefeasible right to 'default bail' under proviso to section 167(2) Cr.P.C. if the charge sheet isn't filed within the stipulated time. Essentially, a murder accused had applied for default bail under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. on November 25, 2021, after the completion of 90 days on November 24, 2021, from the first date of judicial remand as the Investigating Officer failed to file a police report under Section 173(2) 2 Cr.P.C. against him. Now, the Chief Judicial Magistrate passed an order and called a report from the Additional Public Prosecutor on November 25, 2021. Till that point in time, the charge sheet had not been filed. Pursuant to Court's order, the Public Prosecutor submitted his report. Thereafter a second report was submitted and meanwhile, a charge sheet was filed thus, the Court dismissed his plea for default bail. Challenging the same, the accused moved to the High Court averring that he had availed his right of bail before the filing of the charge sheet and it does not matter whether an order had been passed on the aforesaid application or not. Court's observations  At the outset, the bench referred to a three Judges Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in Bikramjit Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 2020 (10) SCC 616, wherein it was held that the right of the accused under section 167(2), arises, if the charge-sheet has not been filed by the prosecution within stipulated period so indicated under section 167(1). In other words, in the Bikramjit Singh case (Supra), the Supreme Court had observed that the accused gets an indefeasible right to 'default bail' if he makes an application after the maximum period for investigation of an offence is over, and before a charge sheet is filed.  The right to default bail, Justice RF Nariman led bench said, is a fundamental right granted to an accused person to be released on bail once the conditions of the first proviso to Section 167(2) are fulfilled. Also, in Bikramjit Singh's case, it was also observed that even if the application for consideration of an order of being released on bail is posted before the court after some length of time, or even if the Magistrate refuses the application erroneously and the accused moves the higher forum for getting a formal order of being released on bail in the enforcement of his indefeasible right, then filing of challan at that stage will not take away the right of the accused. Now, against the backdrop of Bikramjit Singh ruling, the High Court opined that so long as an application for grant of default bail is made on expiry of the period of 90 days (which application need not even be in writing) before a charge sheet is filed, the right to default bail becomes complete. "It is of no moment that the Criminal Court in question either does not dispose of such application before the charge sheet is filed or disposes of such application wrongly before such charge sheet is filed. So long as an application has been made for default bail on expiry of the stated period before time is further extended to the maximum period of 180 days, default bail, being an indefeasible right of the accused under the first proviso to Section 167(2), kicks in and must be granted," the Court held. From the above discussion, the Court averred thar it was clear that charge-sheet in the instant case had been submitted after statutory period of 90 days and that, before filing of charge-sheet, the accused had moved application for bail.  Subsequent filing of chargesheet will not defeat the indefeasible right accrued to the applicant-accused. Learned Magistrate has failed to appreciate the facts and law on the point and order passed by learned Magistrate is against the law. In view of above, the application succeeded and was thereby allowed. Accordingly, impugned order dated 25.11.2021 passed by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Prayagraj was thereby quashed and his default bail application was allowed.  Case title - Anwar Ali v. State Of UP And Another [APPLICATION U/s 482 No. - 29733 of 2021]   
The Delhi High Court has observed that in cases where parties are represented by counsel, the said counsel have a bounden duty to ensure that pleadings, filed before a Court, are intelligible. Giving a word of caution, Justice C Hari Shankar expressed displeasure over filing of an application of the petitioner under Order VII Rule 14 of Code of Civil Procedure after opining that the same did not contain a single sentence which was grammatically or syntactically correct. "….worse, one has to strain one's imagination, considerably, to be able to fathom what the application seeks to state," the Court said.  It added "Such pleadings do little credit to Counsel, as they betoken a completely lackadaisical attitude, in filing pleadings before the Court. They also indicate, prima facie, lack of due respect to the Court and to judicial procedure." Thus, the Court rejected a plea challenging an impugned order dated 24th February, 2022 wherein the Trial Court had rejected an application under Order VII Rule 14 filed by the petitioner, defendant in the civil suit, with costs of Rs. 5000. The respondent had claimed to have supplied fabric to the petitioner during the period 4th August, 2017 to 20th June, 2018, against which an amount of Rs. 56.64,846 was alleged to be due and payable by the petitioner to the respondent.  The suit, therefore, sought a decree, in favour of the respondent and against the petitioner for the said amount alongwith pendente lite and future interest at 18% p.a. from the date of filing the suit till the realisation of the amount and costs. The petitioner had filed a written statement and a counter claim in response to the suit of the respondents, accompanied by a statement of truth. This was followed by two affidavits of witnesses whose evidence the petitioner desired to lead, in support of the written statement as well as the counter claim.  Additionally, the petitioner also filed an application under Order VII Rule 14(3)1 of the CPC to take on record certain additional documents. The impugned order dismissed the aforesaid application under Order VII Rule 14(3) of the CPC, against which the petitioner had approached the High Court.  The Court was of the view that "Reasonable cause", within the meaning of Order XI Rule 1(10) of the CPC, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, cannot extend to negligence in filing of documents before the Court.  "Reasonable cause", necessarily, must refer to a cause which was outside the control of the petitioner, and which prevented the petitioner from filing the concerned documents along with the written statement," it added.  Accordingly, the Court concluded that the decision of the Commercial Court not to allow the placing of additional documents by the petitioner, on record, cannot be faulted with.  "No error of jurisdiction or other error warranting supervisory correction, in exercise of Article 227 jurisdiction of this Court, can be said to exist," the Court added.  The plea was accordingly rejected.  Case Title: BELA CREATION PVT LTD v. ANUJ TEXTILES    
"Access to justice and confidence of the litigant public in impartial justice being administered by tribunals need to be restored."In its judgment setting aside the provisions in the Tribunals Reforms Ordinance 2021 which fixed the term of members of various tribunals as four years, the Supreme Court called upon the Centre to ensure that all the vacancies in the tribunals are filled up without delay.Existence of large number of vacancies of Members and Chairpersons and the inordinate delay caused in filling them up... In its judgment setting aside the provisions in the Tribunals Reforms Ordinance 2021 which fixed the term of members of various tribunals as four years, the Supreme Court called upon the Centre to ensure that all the vacancies in the tribunals are filled up without delay. Existence of large number of vacancies of Members and Chairpersons and the inordinate delay caused in filling them up has resulted in emasculation of the tribunals, Justice L. Nageswara Rao observed in his judgment. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, in his concurring judgment, observed that it is necessary that the Union expedite the process of appointments to tribunals, for 'ensuring swifter, and efficacious justice delivery,'. Justice Rao made this observation as a 'peroration' of his judgment. He noted thus: "59.......Existence of large number of vacancies of Members and Chairpersons and the inordinate delay caused in filling them up has resulted in emasculation of the tribunals. The main reason for tribunalisation, which is to provide speedy justice, is not achieved as tribunals are wilting under the unbearable weight of the exploding docket. Undoubtedly, the legislature is free to exercise its power to make laws and the executive is the best judge to decide policy matters. However, it is high time that a serious effort is made by all concerned to ensure that all the vacancies in the tribunals are filled up without delay. Access to justice and confidence of the litigant public in impartial justice being administered by tribunals need to be restored." Justice Bhat said that in earlier judgment, the Supreme Court had directed the Union 'to make appointments to tribunals within three months from the date on which the Search-cum-Selection Committee completes the selection process and makes its recommendations.' The judge noted the  statistics about vacancies and pendency of cases as follows: "The  necessity to take action on this is emphasized by the nuts and bolts of the adjudicatory functions of tribunals. As many as 21,259 cases were pending before the National Company Law Tribunal as on 31.12.2020, and 2278 cases were filed before the tribunal under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 during the period of April to December 2020, out of which only 176 have been disposed so far. As on April 2021, the NCLT comprised of its Acting President and a total number of 38 members, out of which 17 are judicial members and 21 are technical members - much below than the sanctioned strength of 63 members.At the Armed Forces Tribunal, against a sanctioned strength of 34, only 11 members are currently in office – 4 judicial members and 6 administrative members, for the tribunal's 11 benches. Till 28.02.2021, a total of 18,829 cases were pending for disposal; the highest pendency was before the principal bench in Delhi, with 5553 cases, followed by Chandigarh with 4512 cases and Jaipur with 3154 cases. At the 18 benches of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), only 36 members are in office, against a sanctioned strength of 65.51 Over 48,000 cases are pending disposal at the CAT, with over 28,000 cases pending for 1-5 years. As on 01.03.2021, 72,452 cases were pending before various benches of the CESTAT. Out of a total strength of 26, 18 positions are filled, and 8 vacancies are still open in the 9 benches of the CESTAT. At the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), only 66 members are in office, out of a sanctioned strength of 12654, and a total of about 88,000 appeals are pending. 24,000 are pending before the Delhi bench, followed by about 16,000 before the Mumbai bench. At the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), 138105 cases have been filed since inception (i.e. since 1987) out of which 1,16,572 have been disposed of. 21,443 cases are pending. At state commissions, 124559 cases are still pending, and 401184 are pending before district forums. The total pendency is 547186 cases.Out of the 44 benches of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and sole Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT), 11 benches have vacancies. As of April 2020, the Railway Claims Tribunal had 25,571 pending cases." "44. The sheer volume of pendency is an indicator of the substantial judicial functions carried out by tribunals, necessitating that they be manned by efficient, well qualified judicial and technical members. It is necessary that the Union expedite the process of appointments to tribunals, towards ensuring swifter, and efficacious justice delivery.", Justice Bhat added.

The Supreme Court has observed that in matters relating to service jurisprudence it is not essential to implead each and everyone who could be affected but if a section of such affected employees is impleaded then the interest of all is represented and protected. The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna in the present matter was considering civil appeals against the Allahabad High Court's order dated December 4, 2019. The High Court while allowing the appeal against the order of Single Judge had observed that there was extraordinary delay on the part of the writ petitioners in approaching the Court in as much as the seniority list of 2006 which had formed the basis of the 2009 seniority list, was not challenged within a reasonable time. The Single Judge had set aside the final seniority list and had directed the appointing authority for preparation of fresh seniority list in accordance with Uttar Pradesh Government Servants Seniority Rules, 1991, be it Rule 5 or Rule 8 thereof. While allowing the appeals, the Supreme Court noted in the instant case Ajay Kumar Shukla And Others V. Arvind Rai And Others : "In matters relating to service jurisprudence, time and again it has been held that it is not essential to implead each and every one who could be affected but if a section of such affected employees is impleaded then the interest of all is represented and protected. In view of the above, it is well settled that impleadment of a few of the affected employees would be sufficient compliance of the principle of joinder of parties and they could defend the interest of all affected persons in their representative capacity. Non-joining of all the parties cannot be held to be fatal." Factual Matrix  The Chief Engineer, Department of Minor Irrigation send a requisition dated June 18, 1998 to the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission ("Commission") requesting for recruiting 206 posts of Junior Engineers in the Department of Minor Irrigation which were divided between agriculture, mechanical and civil streams in the ratio of 50:30:20 respectively. The Commission issued an Advertisement No 3 of 1998-1999 for inviting applications for the post of Junior Engineers and after finalizing the results, the Commission forwarded three separate select lists to the Minor Irrigation Department of the State Government. Based upon the three select lists forwarded by the Commission the appointment letter was issued on October 8, 2001, which clearly indicated that the issue regarding seniority would be decided later on. A tentative seniority list was published in 2006 vide office order dated March 17, 2006 with respect to all the Junior Engineers appointed after January 1, 1989 and by office order dated September 5, 2006 published a final seniority list. In 2009, the Department took a fresh exercise of preparing the seniority list as the Rules relating to Junior Engineers were framed by the Minor Irrigation Department for the first time. Accordingly pursuant to publication of a provisional seniority list objections were invited by order dated December 29,2009 and thus on March 5, 2010 a final seniority list was published. Paragraph 11 of the office order dated March 5, 2010 had referred that the Commission had sent three separate lists i.e. of Agricultural stream on September 28, 1999, Mechanical stream on January 6, 2000 and Civil stream on November 7, 2000 and the candidates of the three lists were placed by the Department in the same sequence as they were received with their inter se seniority in their respective lists.  Since the appellants (belonging to mechanical and civil stream) came to know of the mode of preparation of the seniority list after the publication of the final list on March 3, 2010 they approached the High Court after no heed was paid to their representations for correcting the seniority list, by considering the inter se merit of all the three streams i.e. Agricultural, Mechanical and Civil on the basis of the marks obtained in their examinations . They argued that they were under the bona fide belief that the department had prepared a seniority list inter se between all three streams as per the selection and result conveyed by the Commission.  Although the Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court on May 14, 2019 allowed the writ but on preference of an intra court appeal by the respondents (Agriculture Stream), the Division Bench of the High Court on December 4, 2019 dismissed the same.  The Division Bench while dismissing the writ had observed that there was extraordinary delay on the part of the writ petitioners in approaching the Court in as much as the seniority list of 2006 which had formed the basis of the 2009 seniority list, was not challenged within a reasonable time.  The High Court had further observed that all the affected Junior Engineers having not been impleaded would be fatal on the principle of non-joinder of necessary parties. It was also opined that the appellants having participated in selection/appointment process, later on, could not challenge the process as such action would be hit by doctrine of estoppel and acquiescence. The appellants thus approached the Top Court. Submissions Of Counsels Senior Advocate Siddarth Dave and Advocate Preetika Dwivedi appearing for the Appellants submitted that there was no delay on appellant's part in approaching the Court as they learnt for the first time in 2010 when the final seniority list was published on March 5, 2010 that there were three separate select lists forwarded by the Commission. It was also their contention that based upon the date of the receipt of such a select list, the seniority list had been prepared, which was contrary to the statutory rules. It was also their contention that as the challenge was to the decision-making process in making the seniority list contrary to the Uttar Pradesh Government Servants Seniority Rules, 1991 and Uttar Pradesh Minor Irrigation Department Subordinate Engineering Service Rules, 2009 ("Rules 2009") it was not necessary to implead all the affected Engineers. Appellant's counsel further contended that the earlier seniority list would lose significance since a fresh seniority list had to be prepared as Rules 2009 had come into force that required drawing up of a fresh seniority list. Senior Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Advocate Rohit Sthalekar appearing for the respondents submitted that appellants had approached the Court with extraordinary delay and therefore, their claim was not entitled to be entertained and the Division Bench of the High Court rightly upheld the said submission. Supreme Court's Analysis The bench in the judgment authored by Justice Vikram Nath observed that the Appointing Authority, in fact, committed an error in the manner in which the seniority list was prepared by placing the three select lists forwarded by the Commission on different dates one after the other en bloc as per the date of receipt of three select lists. The court further opined that by an oversight, the Appointing Authority failed to prepare the combined seniority list as required under 1991 Seniority Rules, be it Rule 5 or Rule 8 with respect to the selection of the appellants and private-respondents. On the aspect of delay in approaching the court and in particular challenge to a seniority list, the bench observed that,  "Once it is established that the seniority list was prepared in contravention to the statutory provisions laid down in Rules 1991, the seniority list could be interfered with. The Appointing Authority would be bound by the statutory rules and any violation or disregard to the statutory rules would vitiate the seniority list. The same would be arbitrary, de hors the rules and in conflict with Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The only exception to the above would be where there is unreasonable delay which is unexplained." Appointing Authority Ought To Have Prepared A Combined Merit List Based Upon The Performance Or The Proficiency-Based On The Marks Received In The Selection Test As Prepared By The Commission Further the bench also observed that the appointing authority ought to have prepared a combined merit list based upon the performance or the proficiency on the basis of the marks received in the selection test as prepared by the Commission. In this regard the Court further added that otherwise, it would amount to denial of the right of consideration for promotion to a more meritorious candidate as against a candidate having lesser merit.  "Right to promotion is not considered to be a fundamental right but consideration for promotion has now been evolved as a fundamental right," the Court further said. "If the seniority list is allowed to be sustained then the engineers who are more meritorious in the Mechanical and Civil streams than the Junior Engineers of the Agricultural stream would be deprived of their right of being considered for promotion and in fact their right would accrue only after all the Junior Engineers of the Agricultural stream selected in the same selection are granted promotion. For these reasons also the seniority list in question must go," the court added. Case Title: Ajay Kumar Shukla And Others V.

The Madras High Court has directed the Sessions Court for the exclusive trial of bomb blast/NIA cases, Poonamalle to complete the trial in the 2013 auditor Ramesh murder case within two months.  V Ramesh, an auditor by profession and the Tamil Nadu unit General Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was hacked to death in 2013. The mother of the deceased Ramesh had approached the Madras High Court seeking directions to the trial court to dispose of the case in an expeditious manner.   She claimed that the deceased was targeted by Islamic terrorists and was a victim of a series of killings against members of the Hindutva group. It was further submitted that even though the occurrence took place in 2013, the chargesheet was filed only in 2014. Since the eyewitnesses of the incident were senior citizens aged more than 80 years, the petitioner sought direction for speedy disposal.   Justice RN Manjula noted that even though charges were framed in 2014, the case was pending for all these years. The court also expressed anguish over the fact that the case had been adjourned more than fifty times for counseling. The court added that even if the counseling was to be given to the victims, the same should not have affected the trial.  It is not known what kind of counselling is given and for whom. Even if the counselling is presumed to have been given to the victim, that cannot be a bar for the conduction of the case.    The court added that since the key witnesses were senior citizens, the trial court should act in a responsible manner and should examine the senior citizen witnesses as expeditiously as possible. The court noted that the trial court had shown insensitivity in conducting one of the oldest matters pending before the trial court.   Since the proceedings would reveal the insensitivity in conducting one of the oldest matters pending in the Court, I feel it is appropriate to impress the learned Judge, Sessions Court for Exclusive Trial of Bomb blast / NIA cases, Poonamallee, to dispose the case within a time frame.   Thus, the court directed the trial court to conduct the proceeding within a period of two months by posting the case on a day-to-day basis and if needed by adjourning the case not beyond two or three days.  Case Title: V Kamala v. The State of Tamil Nadu and others  
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently allowed 'swap transplantation' of kidneys between persons not related to each other as per the definition of 'near relatives' under the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994.  Noting that even though a 'mother-in-law and a 'son-in-law' would not fall within the definition of 'near relatives' as per the Act, the single bench of Justice Vinod S. Bhardwaj, while allowing for swap transplant, said that:  "The object of Section 9 (3)(A) should not be permitted to be defeated by a rigid, dogmatic and stigmatic interpretation and not to include people who get related by matrimony and would have same love and affection."  Petitioner nos. 1 and 2 were suffering from kidney ailments and were advised to undergo the kidney transplantation. Petitioner no. 4, the mother-in-law of petitioner no. 1, and petitioner no. 3 – the wife of petitioner no. 2 agreed to donate their kidneys, however, due to biological incompatibility between petitioner nos. 1 and 4 and between petitioner nos. 2 and 3, respectively, transplants were not possible.  Upon discovery of cross-over compatibility between petitioner nos. 1 and 3, and petitioner nos. 2 and 4, the donors – petitioner nos. 3 and 4, voluntarily and out of natural love and affection agreed to donate their kidneys to petitioner nos. 1 and 2, respectively. For this, the petitioners applied for 'swap transplantation' under the 1994 Act r/w the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules, 2014, which application was rejected by the Authorization Committee of the hospital, PGIMER, Chandigarh, based on the ground that swapping of organs was not possible in this case, since a 'mother-in-law' and 'son-in-law' could not be said to be 'near relatives.'   Upon rejection of their application, the petitioners, approached the High Court praying for the issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus to grant them approval to engage in 'swap transplantation,' setting aside the decision of the Authorization Committee.   Contentions of the petitioners  The petitioners contended that the decision of the Authorisation Committee was passed in ignorance of the object of the Act, which as per the Supreme Court decision in Kuldeep Singh and Others v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2005) 11 SCC 122, is to provide for the regulation of removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes and to prevent commercial dealings in human organs. They argued that in the absence of any commercial element and the arrangement being purely humane in this case, there was no reason for the Committee to reject their application.   The petitioners also contended that a rigid or dogmatic approach could not be adopted or promoted in view of the object of the Act and that the Committee through its decision failed to take into account the larger public cause and concern which was in issue.  Contentions of the respondents  The respondents, argued that there was no illegality, perversity or impropriety in the order passed by the Authorization Committee, since the Committee had acted within the strict compliance of the Act and the Rules.   Ruling  The Court, after noting the object of the Act, which was to prevent commercial dealings in organs, observed that the test which had to be met in cases of swap transplant was to rule out the possibility of commercial element in the transplant. The Court said that:  "Loss of human life should not be permitted merely at the altar of technicalities and more so when the possibility of commercial transaction in such swapping has been completely ruled out. The donor for petitioner no.1 is his mother-in-law and as such, it cannot be construed that the said donor has agreed to donate her kidney for commercial reasons."  "The social family bonds; the social fabric and family structure in the Indian Sub-Continent is also required to be kept in consideration and such relatives from the family of the spouse cannot be isolated as completely distant or wholly unrelated" – added the Court.   Accordingly, the High Court in exercise of its inherent and equitable jurisdiction set aside the order of the Authorisation Committee and granted permission to the petitioners to swap their kidneys.

The person in possession of a tenement being re-developed will be entitled to transit rent in the absence of a court order stating otherwise, even if he or she doesn't own the premises, the Bombay High Court has held. In the present case, the HC also asked the developer to put the occupant in possession of the redeveloped property if his dispute with the flat owner is not finally... The person in possession of a tenement being re-developed will be entitled to transit rent in the absence of a court order stating otherwise, even if he or she doesn't own the premises, the Bombay High Court has held.  In the present case, the HC also asked the developer to put the occupant in possession of the redeveloped property if his dispute with the flat owner is not finally decided by then.   Justice GS Kulkarni observed, "The fact remains that as respondent no.3 (occupier) is in possession of the tenement in question and would now be handing over possession of such tenement to the petitioner/society… The party who is dispossessed, would be entitled to the transit rent as it is such party who is put to hardship."  In the present case the developer - Maniar Associates LLP – had approached the HC under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 citing a clause in his agreement with Vijay Niwas Co-op. Hsg. Soc. Ltd, seeking interim relief to empty a building for redevelopment.   The developer represented by Advocates Rohan Sawant and Sneha Marjadi, instructed by Advocate Jay Vakil stated that 11 out of 12 members had vacated their flats and just one family was holding up the redevelopment.   The court was informed that the owner of the flat had filed a trespassing case against the occupant in the HC in separate proceedings. Conversely, the occupant said he was a lawful tenant and not a trespasser, therefore the suit must be rejected and he refused to vacate the premises.  Therefore the developer sought orders against the occupant to hand over the premises to society and not create a hindrance in the redevelopment process.   Observations  At the outset the court observed that it was clear that the flat owner and his alleged tenant were holding up the redevelopment of a dilapidated building.   "It needs to be noted that, it is quite settled that the minority members of the society cannot take a position contrary to the will of the majority members of the society."   The bench believed that a prima facie case for relief was definitely made out in the developer's favour.   Advocate Kunal R. Kumbhat for the occupant said he was not against redevelopment or handing over possession. However, since he was the occupant, he would be entitled to transit rent and possession in the redeveloped premises   Advocate Shanay Shah for the flat owner submitted that he should be permitted to seek reliefs before the coordinate bench and in the event of an order to that effect, the benefit of the transit rent and redeveloped flat should come to him.   "Mr. Shah's contention in my opinion, is fair and correct as in the present proceedings, it is not possible for this Court to determine any rights either of respondent nos.2 and 3 qua the flat in question, as such rights are already subject matter of the pending suit," the bench observed.  Opining that the occupant would be entitled to transit rent in the absence of a court order in his dispute with the flat owner, the court ordered him to handover possession, which would be contingent on the outcome of the suit.   "Needless to observe that in the event the inter se rights between respondent nos. 2(flat owner) and 3 (occupant) are not decided in the pending suit between these parties, on the day the construction of the building is complete and possession of the redevelopment premises is to be handed over, in such event, as respondent no.3 (occupant) shall be handing over the possession of the flat in question, the petitioner/society shall hand over possession of the redeveloped premises to respondent no.3, which shall be subject to the final orders which may be passed in the pending suit."

Taking note of allegations about numerous fake motor accident claims, the Madras High Court has ordered a detailed probe into 84 cases claiming a total of Rs.11.70 Crores, that were withdrawn after the complaint.

Taking note of allegations about numerous fake motor accident claims, the Madras High Court has ordered a detailed probe into 84 cases claiming a total of Rs.11.70 Crores, that were withdrawn after the complaint.  Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed, "This is not merely coincidental and it is more a knee-jerk reaction after complaints were made to the effect that claims have been filed with false and fabricated medical and hospital records of Cavery Hospital, Hosur. It is not clear as to whether the concerned Judges before dismissing the 84 claims as not pressed, even conducted any preliminary enquiry to ascertain as to why so many claims are not pressed." The Court thus suo motu impleaded Secretary, Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority to enquire into the 84 claims, previously pending before ADJ, Hosur and PSJ, Hosur.  The High Court wants to ascertain whether the claims have been not pressed with the knowledge of the concerned claimants. "The Secretary, Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority is directed to co-ordinate with the District Legal Services Authority and the claimants who have made the claims in the 84 MCOPs shall be summoned and enquiry shall be conducted to find out if the claims were not pressed after getting their concurrence. While conducting the enquiry, the Legal Services Authority shall also identify genuine claims and report it to the concerned insurance companies…", the court noted in the list of directions included in the order.  The court has also asked Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited to deposit a sum of Rupees two lakhs towards the expenses that State Legal Services Authority might incur by summoning the claimants concerned for enquiry. The Secretary has also been instructed to file a report before the court by the next date of hearing.  Exercising the powers under Article 226 and Article 227, the court has directed the restoration of the 84 cases on file by the Additional District Judges and Principal District Judge at Hosur.  "…In all the 84 cases, the State Legal Services Authority in co-ordination with the District Legal Services Authority shall appoint Panel Advocates to represent the claimants. This will ensure that in all those cases where the parties are able to arrive at a settlement and just compensation is fixed, an award can be passed by recording the compromise. In all those cases where there is a contest, the claimants will be ably assisted by the Panel Advocates to safeguard their rights and interests. If ultimately, it is found that fabricated/false records were filed before the Court, it will enable the Court to initiate action in the concerned MCOP cases", the court added.  The 84 claims currently under the radar of the court were dismissed as not pressed in 2019. The status report filed by Assistant Inspector General of Police, Law and Order, Chennai sought more time for the completion of the probe which was accepted by the court. The police has been asked to thoroughly continue the enquiry and submit a report before the court by the next date of hearing, i.e., 4th April.  In the status report, it has been mentioned by the police that there is a 'concerted conspiracy' from the moment an accident takes place, and the 'modus operandi' of the teams comprising of brokers and specialised practitioners are 'skilled' and 'well entrenched' to create serious ramifications for all concerned stakeholders.  "There are several instances of even 108 Ambulances being driven to a private hospital, very nearly hijacked, one can say, after recording Accident Register copy in a government hospital, for the record. This has a critical and detrimental impact on trauma care, during the "Golden Hour" in the treatment to victim", the additional affidavit filed by the respondent police states.  After acknowledging the status report, the court has also asked the special investigation team to enquire the concerned officials of Tamil Nadu Accident and Emergency Care Initiative (TAEI) that has trauma care centers on Highways and record their statements in the report that will be submitted before the court. "In view of the seriousness of the allegations made in the present case to the effect that a total of Rs 11.70 crore was claimed in 84 cases filed based on fabricated/false medical/hospital records and a complaint was also made by the hospital to the Hosur police in 2019, which was said to have been closed as 'action dropped' and in view of the fact that the claims came to be withdrawn as not pressed subsequently, this Court wants to probe into this issue thoroughly," Justice N Anand Venkatesh said. Background  In the beginning of 2021, Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Limited had filed a petition before the High Court seeking directions for the constitution of a Special Investigation Team to investigate nearly 120 claims made through fake and fabricated insurance policies.  The petitioner Company contended that fake claims have been made on the basis of fake insurance policies by tampering with insurance policies, taking advantage of the online mode of filing documents and completing transactions. The company submitted that they had come across 120 claims so made on the basis of fake insurance policies running to the tune of 15.63 crores.  Noting the wide ramificiations of fake claims and the concerted efforts of those behind the fake policy scam, Madras High Court ordered the constitution of SIT in March, 2021. Pursuant to the court order, an interim SIT with Assistant Inspector General of Police at its helm was formed.  It is pertinent to note here that a digital platform to upload the documents pertaining to motor accident claims and a Detailed Accident Report (DAR) Regime came into force after the High Court passed directions to that effect in another similar case in 2016. In 2020, after the receipt of a report submitted by the expert committee headed by Retd. Justice K. Chandru, the court found out that there were nearly 280 false claims equivalent to Rs 50 crores which was withdrawn.  In 2020, in yet another case, the court went on to pass a few directions for effective implementation of DAR regime. Case Title: Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company v.

The Kerala High Court on Thursday, while disposing of two pleas challenging the grant of anticipatory bail to the author and social activist Civic Chandran in a sexual harassment case, expunged the 'sexually provocative dress' remark of Kozhikode Sessions Court. Justice Kauser Edappagath, while disposing of the two pleas moved by the State as well as the De facto complainant against the anticipatory bail order, observed that even though the reason shown by the Court below for granting anticipatory bail cannot be justified, the order granting anticipatory bail cannot be set aside.  In these circumstances, I am of the view that even though the reason shown by the Court below for granting anticipatory bail cannot be justified, the order granting anticipatory bail by the Court below cannot be set aside. The observations in the Kozhikode Sessions Court order, which was passed on August 12, had created a massive outrage. The court had said offence under Section 354A of the Indian Penal Code is not prima facie attracted when the woman was wearing 'sexually provocative dresses'. In the Criminal Miscellaneous Petition filed under Sections 482 read with 439(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the State had challenged the findings and reasoning given by the Sessions Court as suffering from "illegality, lack of sensitivity, sobriety and perversity". While passing the order, Justice Edappagath observed that the dressing of a victim cannot be construed as a legal ground to absolve an accused from the charge of outraging the modesty of a woman. "The dressing of a victim cannot be construed as a legal ground to absolve an accused from the charge of outraging the modesty of a woman. The right to wear any dress is a natural extension of personal freedom guaranteed by the Constitution and a facet of the fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Even if a woman wears a provocative dress that cannot give a licence to a man to outrage her modesty. Hence, the said finding of the Court below in the impugned order is hereby set aside," said the court. The Court observed that everyone has the freedom to wear whatever he/she wants to wear, subject to the laws of the land. Objectifying women in regard to what she wears cannot be justified. There is no reason why a woman should be judged by her clothes. Furthermore, the Court observed that norms that categorize women based on their attire and expressions can never be tolerated, and it is wrong to say that a woman was sexually assaulted just because she was wearing provocative clothes.  Everyone has the freedom to wear whatever he/she wants to wear, subject to the laws of the land. Objectifying women in regard to what she wears cannot be justified. There is no reason why a woman should be judged by her clothes. Norms that categorize woman based on her attire and expressions can never be tolerated. Relying on the Apex Court decision in Aparna Bhat and Others v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Another in which the Court had held that discussion about the dress, behaviour, or past conduct of the victim should not enter the verdict while granting bail to the accused and it was also observed in the judgment that the Judges should not use any words, spoken or written, that would undermine or shake the confidence of the survivor in the fairness or impartiality of the court; the Court observed that the remarks in the impugned order regarding the provocative dress of the victim cannot be sustained and thereby expunged it. The Court observed that on merits, the petitioner has made out a case for anticipatory bail. The Director General of Prosecution earlier submitted before the Court that the investigation was almost over in the case. Therefore, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and the age of the accused, the Court observed that custodial interrogation will not be necessary. The Court, thereby, disposed of both the Criminal Miscellaneous Cases and upheld the grant of anticipatory bail to the accused. Case Title: State of Kerala v. Civic Chandran and XXXXX v. State of Kerala  
The Delhi High Court has observed that where a party is acting in a recalcitrant fashion, and refusing to make the witness available for examination or cross- examination on repeated occasions without due justification, the court may close the party's right to lead evidence. Justice C Hari Shankar added that while it is a matter of Court's discretion which takes a call on the request of the party to lead evidence and that the Court may be ill-inclined in a petition under Article 227 to interfere, it said that such principle applies equally to the Court which passed the order under challenge as to the Court which is seized of the challenge under Article 227.  "The self-imposed proscriptive limitations under Article 227 of the Constitution of India cannot be permitted to bind the hands of a court where, in the process, the cause of substantial justice would be the causality," the Court added.  The Court was dealing with a plea challenging an order dated 4th March, 2022 passed by the Additional Rent Controller in an eviction petition preferred by the respondent against the petitioner. Given the limited nature of the controversy in these vide order dated 14th December, 2021, the ARC rejected the request of the petitioner seeking an adjournment on the ground of indisposition of the respondent's witness, who was a senior citizen. The ARC was of the opinion that as the matter had been adjourned since long, awaiting recording of the petitioner's evidence, and costs had also been imposed on the petitioner in that regard, no occasion arose to grant any further opportunity to the petitioner to lead evidence. The right of the petitioner to lead his evidence was, therefore, closed. The petitioner had then moved an application under Order XVIII Rule 17 read with Section 151 of the CPC seeking recall of the aforesaid order. Said application was dismissed by the ARC vide order dated 4th March, 2022. Reiterating his earlier decision that several opportunities had been granted to the petitioner to lead evidence, and expressing a view that if, despite grant of last opportunity, further adjournment was sought, the direction of grant of last opportunity would become meaningless, the ARC rejected the petitioner's application under Order XVIII Rule 17 CPC and held that the petitioner was not entitled to any further opportunity to lead evidence. The Court was of the view that the right to lead evidence, in support of their respective stands, is a valuable vested right in parties in any civil or criminal litigation, and, save for exceptional reasons, said right should not be lightly forfeited. "Having said that, if a party is acting in a recalcitrant fashion, and refusing to make the witness available for examination/cross- examination on repeated occasions without due justification, the court may, in a given case, close the party's right to lead evidence," the Court said.  Perusing the impugned order dated 4th March, 2022, the Court was of the view that the same indicated that the inability of the petitioner to lead evidence was not owing to any avoidable negligence, but was largely for valid and unavoidable reasons. "A bare glance at the aforesaid sequence of dates would reveal that though, undoubtedly, the matter was adjourned on several occasions after the petitioner was first directed to lead evidence, the petitioner could not be attributed any avoidable negligence or indolence in prosecuting the proceedings before the court, or in leading evidence," the Court observed.  Accordingly, the Court observed that keeping the interests of substantial justice in mind, the petitioner ought to be granted one opportunity to lead his evidence. "It is made clear that the petitioner (the respondent before the learned ARC) should present himself for recording of his evidence tomorrow i.e. 20th May, 2022 and that the petitioner should have the remaining three RWs available for recording of their evidence on the next date to be fixed by the learned ARC," the Court added.  The plea was thus allowed.  Case Title: M/S BHARAT INVESTMENT CORPORATION v. SMT. SANJANA SAINI

The Supreme Court has observed that a long delay in lodging FIR can be a valid consideration for grant of anticipatory bail. The bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan observed thus while allowing the anticipatory bail plea of former Director General of Police (DGP), Punjab, Sumedh Singh Saini who had sought the bail relation to the 1991 Balwant Singh Multani murder case. "However, considering the fact that the impugned FIR has been lodged/filed by the brother of the deceased after a period of almost 29 years from the date of incident and after a period of 9 years from the date of decision of this Court in the case of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar (supra) and nothing is on record that in between he had taken any steps to initiate criminal proceedings and/or lodged an FIR, we are of the opinion that at 11 least a case is made out by the appellant for grant of anticipatory bail under Section 438, Cr.P.C. Many a time, delay may not be fatal to the criminal proceedings. However, it always depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, at the same time, a long delay like 29 years as in the present case can certainly be a valid consideration for grant of anticipatory bail.", the bench also comprising Justices R. Subhash Reddy and MR Shah observed. The FIR alleged that Balwant Singh Multani was killed in State-managed elimination around the month of December 1991. Allegedly, during the tenure of Sumedh Singh Saini as SSP, Chandigarh on the early morning of 11.12.1991 the police of Chandigarh swooped upon the residence of the deceased and took him away forcibly and illegally without assigning any reason. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had dismissed his application seeking anticipatory bail. In appeal before the Apex Court, Saini contended that the present FIR is filed with a malafide intention to harass him at the instance of the present party in power in the State. It was submitted that the present FIR is not maintainable as being a second FIR on the same set of facts and has been registered after delay of 29 years of the alleged incident. The court noted that whether the fresh/present proceedings are permissible in law are yet to be considered by this Court in the pending proceedings for quashing the impugned FIR.  While granting him anticipatory bail, the bench observed: "Looking to the status of the appellant and it is reported that he has retired in the year 2018 as Director General of Police, Punjab after 30 years of service and the alleged incident is of the year 1991 and even in the present FIR initially there was no allegation for the offence under Section 302 IPC and the allegations were only for the offences under Sections 364, 201, 344, 330, 219 and 120­B of the IPC, for which there was an order of anticipatory bail in favour of the appellant and subsequently the offence under Section 302 IPC has been added on the basis of the statements of Jagir Singh and Kuldip Singh – approvers only, we are of the opinion that the appellant has made out a case for anticipatory bail."

The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence awarded to 4 people in a 27-year-old murder case while noting that the case did not fall in the category of 'rarest of rare cases', warranting capital punishment.The Bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Vivek Varma didn't agree with the opinion of the trial court that the murder was premeditated and pre-planned one. In fact,... The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence awarded to 4 people in a 27-year-old murder case while noting that the case did not fall in the category of 'rarest of rare cases', warranting capital punishment. The Bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Vivek Varma didn't agree with the opinion of the trial court that the murder was premeditated and pre-planned one. In fact, the trial court had concluded that the imposition of a lesser sentence than that of a death sentence, would not be adequate and appropriate.  The background of the case On the intervening night of 10-11/November/1994, the 4 appellants Krishna Murari, Raghav Ram Verma, Kashi Ram Verma, and Ram Milan Verma along with 2-3 others killed 4 persons on account of ongoing litigation related to a property dispute. The relative of the victims, Rama Kant Verma (PW-1) lodged an FIR in the matter and a case under Sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 120B I.P.C. was registered against the appellant in the Faizabvad Police Station. The accused/appellants were arrested and put to trial. The Trial based the conviction of appellants and acquittal of two persons on the ocular testimony of the informant Rama Kant Verma PW-1 and Uma Kant Verma PW-2, who are the family members of the deceased. The instant Capital Sentence Reference arose out of the Reference made by the trial Court under Section 366 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to the Court for confirmation of the death sentence of four convicts/appellants. Analysis of the evidence by the Court Since the trial court had based its decision on the testimonies of the PW-1 and PW-2, the primary argument was made before the High Court by the appellants that the testimonies of P.W.1 and P.W.2 cannot be relied upon as they are interested and family members of the deceased and further their presence at the place of occurrence is doubtful. To this, the High Court, at the outset, noted that if the Court is satisfied that the evidence of a family member is creditworthy, then, there is no bar on the Court in relying on such witness. Further, the Court analyzed the testimonies of both the witnesses and observed that both of them were wholly truthful witnesses as they had furnished the same details regarding the manner of assault and while dealing with their evidence, the Court also found that their version in relation to the assault on the deceased was in consonance with the medical evidence. The Court also noted that although P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma were extensively cross-examined, however, nothing was extracted from them which could impair their credibility. The Court also didn't find any major contradiction, either in the evidence of the witnesses, or any conflict in medical or ocular evidence that could tilt the balance in favor of the convicts/appellants. Further, the Court also discarded the arguments put forth by the appellants that there was no recovery of weapon, there was no motive to commit the crime, and that no independent witnesses were examined to prove the prosecution case. "The prosecution is not bound to produce all the witnesses said to have seen the occurrence. Material witnesses considered necessary by the prosecution for unfolding the prosecution story alone need be produced without unnecessary and redundant multiplication of witnesses," the Court observed. Consequently, having found that the evidence of P.W.1-Rama Kant Verma and P.W.2-Uma Kant Verma inspire confidence and their evidence squarely establishes the involvement of appellants Krishna Murari, Raghav Ram, Kashi Ram, and Ram Milan in the incident, the Court did not find any problem with the order of the trial Court in convicting Krishna Murari, Raghav Ram, Kashi Ram, and Ram Milan for the offence punishable u/s 302 read with Section 149 I.P.C. and Section 148 I.P.C. Discussion over the capital sentence At the outset, the Court relied on several judgments including, Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab and Machchi Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab where it was observed that, "In deciding whether a case falls within the category of the rarest of the rare, the brutality and/or gruesome and/or heinous nature of the crime is not the sole criterion. Court has to take into consideration the state of his mind, his socio-economic background etc. Awarding death sentence is an exception and life imprisonment is the rule." Taking into account the rulings of the Apex Court, the High Court observed that while awarding the death sentence to the appellants, the trial Court has drawn a conclusion that the appellants had committed the offence of murder of the deceased with pre-determined mind and pre-planned manner, hence the same comes in the category of 'rarest of rare cases'. However, the High Court did not agree with the opinion of the Trial Court that the murder was committed with a pre-determined mind and pre-planned manner.  "It is true that the manner in which crime has been committed by the appellants by Gandasa and Banka blows, is brutal, cruel and gruesome, but there is absolutely no evidence to suggest as to what could be the reason for the appellants to commit the said offence. This could be because of frustration, mental stress or emotional disorder which would be the mitigating circumstances to be taken note of," observed the Court as it concluded that the instant case does not fall in the category of 'rarest of rare cases'." Therefore, the death sentence awarded to the convicts/ appellants under Section 302 read with Section 149 of IPC was converted into life imprisonment.   
A domestic violence complaint cannot be filed at a place a woman is only casually visiting and proceedings must be instituted at her temporary or permanent residence under section 27 of the Domestic Violence Act, the Bombay High Court said.

A domestic violence complaint cannot be filed at a place a woman is only casually visiting and proceedings must be instituted at her temporary or permanent residence under section 27 of the Domestic Violence Act, the Bombay High Court said.  The court interpreted 'temporary residence' to mean the place an aggrieved person has temporarily decided to make their home and not a lodge or a guest house, meant for short visits.   Justice SK Shinde thus upheld a magistrate's order declining to entertain a woman's application under section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act for want of jurisdiction under section 27 as both parties were permanent residents of Hyderabad.   The court rejected the woman's argument that she was forced to 'flee' Hyderabad in September and since she had filed two non-cognizable complaints with the police in Mumbai, in October, 2021, the DV complaint was rightly filed in Mumbai.  It held that the woman was not "temporarily" residing in Mumbai and no cause of action arose here. And the facts in the application and documents leads to indicate that Applicants' visit to Mumbai was 'casual visit' and does not imply definite intention to stay at a particular place.  "Therefore, order passed by the Magistrate cannot be faulted with, either for wrong or non-exercise of jurisdiction. In fact, if liberal construction is placed upon the provision, made under Section 27 of the Act, as sought by the Applicants, it may lead to abuse of legal process of law, as aggrieved person may choose, any place, where she may be a casual visitor."  The court relied heavily on the Delhi High Court judgements of Sharad Kumar Pandey Vs. Mamta Pandey and another judgement of Rabindra Nath Sahu & Another Vs. Smt. Susila Sahu 2016 in which the court held that temporary residence does not include residence in a lodge or hostel or residence at a place only for the purpose of filing a domestic violence case and further observed that this temporary residence must be also be a continuing residence from the date of acquiring residence till the application under Section 12 is disposed of.  He also relied on Ramesh Mohanlal Bhutada Vs. State of Mahrashtra & Ors. 2011 regarding the interpretation of casual visit versus temporary visit.   Facts of the Case  According to the woman's complaint, the couple married in 1993 at Hyderabad. Unable to bear the torture meted out to her by her husband and son she came to Mumbai on 27th September, 2021 and stayed as a guest in one of the hotels at Bombay-Kurla Complex and later shifted to hotel Grand Hyatt.   She filed an NC with the BKC police station on October 6 and 7, alleging she was constantly being watched and physically stalked. On October 12 she approached the Magistrate's court at Bandra seeking restraining orders against the husband and son in connection with their shared house hold, invoking sections 18 and 19 of the DV Act.   In a separate application she further sought ex-parte protection and residence orders under section 23 (2) of the DV Act. The magistrate refused relief on October 23. She approached the High Court under Article 226 and section 482 for quashing the magistrate's order.   Submission  The petitioner's lawyer argued that the magistrate failed to consider that the two police complaints filed in Mumbai would constitute DV within the local limits of the court and were maintainable. The woman was forced to leave her shared household in compelling circumstances. Moreover, she was unlikely to get relief in Hyderabad as her husband in an influential person.  Conversely the husband argued that there has to be compelling material to show the wife is residing in Mumbai and that she was not just visiting for a couple of days.   Observations  The court held that prima facie the woman is well educated and financially sound. And considering her background it would be difficult to accept that she could not seek protection orders at Hyderabad or that she was forced to leave the Hyderabad and or she was intending to reside in Mumbai.   "On the contrary the chronology of the events do suggest, that the Applicant engineered the cause of action with an intention to file case and confer jurisdiction upon the Magistrate."  The woman was continuously residing in Hyderabad since her marriage in 1993 till September 26-27 and had failed to take steps against the domestic violence caused to her till September, this year, it added while dismissing her plea.     
A Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court has held that the provisions of compassionate appointment as contained under the UP Recruitment of Dependents of Government Servant Dying in 36 Harness Rules, 1974 are applicable upon employees of the District Rural Development Agency. A Full Bench of Justices Ramesh Sinha, Chandra Dhari Singh and Manish Mathur held thus in view of paragraph... A Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court has held that the provisions of compassionate appointment as contained under the UP Recruitment of Dependents of Government Servant Dying in 36 Harness Rules, 1974 are applicable upon employees of the District Rural Development Agency.  A Full Bench of Justices Ramesh Sinha, Chandra Dhari Singh and Manish Mathur held thus in view of paragraph 2(9) of the Government Order dated March 17, 1994, which provides that in respect of matters of employment of DRDA employees, for which there is no specific provision in the said Government Order, such employees would ordinarily be governed by provisions as are applicable upon employees of the State Government.  "A perusal of the Government Order does make it evident that the service rules applicable upon Government servants with regard to appointment, seniority, promotion, reservation etc. have been made applicable upon employees of the DRDA," the Bench observed.  Background  The Full Bench was answering a reference made by a Single Bench in a writ petition challenging an order dated May 22, 2017, whereby claim for grant of compassionate appointment under the 1974 Rules was rejected on the ground that the same are inapplicable in the case of employees of the DRDA.  The Single Judge noticed that a Division Bench in State of UP & Ors. v. Pitamber (2010) had held the DRDA to be 'State' within meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India but at the same time it was also held that the employees of DRDA do not hold any civil post either under the State or the Central Government and do not, therefore, come within purview of the definition 'government employees'.  It was held that merely because an Association falls under the expression 'instrumentality of State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, it would not make its employees come within the definition of government employees  It is on this latter reasoning that another Division Bench in State of UP v. Ajeet Kumar Shahi rejected the claim for compassionate appointment to dependent of an employee of DRDA holding that the 1974 Rules are applicable only upon Government employees.  Findings  Pervasive State Control  The Full Bench observed that the State Government has all pervasive control over the administration of the DRDA.  For instance, the office memorandum which led to creation of DRDAs provide that they shall be controlled and governed by the State Government and it will be headed by the Collector/Deputy Commissioner in each district.  Further, Rule 14 of the bye-laws provide that every employee of DRDA body shall be governed by Service Conduct Rules of the State Government.  Furthermore, even though the governing body of the DRDA is the appointing authority of its employees but, the same would be subject to the directions issued by the Central or the State Government.  Doctrine of 'Occupied Field'  The Bench applied the doctrine of 'occupied field' to hold that the void pertaining to conditions of service of employees of the DRDA, has been filled by issuance of Government Order dated March 17, 1994.  It noted that even though no specific service condition has been indicated in the Government Order pertaining to compassionate appointment. However, a reading of paragraph 2 (9) of the Government Order indicates that other matters which are not covered specifically with the Government Order or any other special order pertaining to employees of the DRDA would be regulated by such rules, regulations and orders which generally apply to Government servants serving with regard to affairs of the State.  'Approbate & Reprobate'  The Court was informed that except for the provisions of compassionate appointment, rest of the service conditions indicated in the Government Order have been implemented in the DRDAs throughout the State.  Taking exception to this, the Full Bench opined that the principle of approbate and reprobate would be applicable in the present circumstance and the opposite parties cannot be permitted to repudiate the conditions of service which are beneficial to the employees of the DRDA while applying other similar such service conditions.  "A reading of the aforesaid paragraph 2(9) of the Government Order makes it evident that there is no specific exclusion of compassionate appointment being granted to employees of the DRDA in terms of the 1974 Rules. On the contrary, the said provision clearly indicates that matters which are not specifically covered in the Government Order would be regulated and applicable as per the rules, regulations and orders generally applicable upon Government servants serving with regard to State affairs. As such, it is clear that compassionate appointment under the 1974 Rules would be covered under the said paragraph 2(9) of the Government Order," the order stated.  Providing benefits of 1974 Rules to DRDA Employees would not give them status of Government Servants  The State counsel had argued that the employees of the DRDA have already been held not to be government servants since they are not holding any civil posts under either the Central or the State Governments and, therefore, providing benefit of the 1974 Rules to employees of the DRDA would amount to giving them the status of Government servants.  Rejecting this argument, the Full bench held,  "By extending the benefit of 1974 Rules upon employees of the DRDA, it cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that it would confer the status of Government employees upon them. Incorporation of the said Rules by reference merely amounts to providing the benefit of a beneficial legislation. As such, extending the benefit of compassionate appointment under the 1974 Rules upon the employees of the DRDA would only have the effect of providing the said beneficial benefit and not granting them the status of Government servants."  Ajeet Kumar Shahi (supra) Overruled  The Full Bench also noted that the decision in State of UP v. Ajeet Kumar Shahi requires reconsideration since the same was passed in ignorance of a Government Order dated July 18, 2016 as per which- employees of the DRDA throughout the State of UP have been absorbed in the department of Rural Development of the State Government.  "Considering the aforesaid factors, the reference has to be answered regarding applicability of the 1974 Rules upon employees of DRDA appointed or working prior to issuance of Government Order dated 18.07.2016 since the said employees after absorption already have the status of State Government employee upon whom the 1974 Rules are automatically applicable now," the Full Bench held.  It added, "The judgment of Division Bench in Ajeet Kumar Shahi (Supra) having been passed in ignorance of Government Order dated 17.03.1994 is held not to be a good law and is, therefore, overruled."

The Supreme Court observed that there is no difference between minority and non-minority aided institutions and that their right to get an aid from the Government is not a fundamental right.An institution receiving aid is bound by the conditions imposed and therefore expected to comply, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh observed while allowing the appeal filed by State... The Supreme Court observed that there is no difference between minority and non-minority aided institutions and that their right to get an aid from the Government is not a fundamental right. An institution receiving aid is bound by the conditions imposed and therefore expected to comply, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh observed while allowing the appeal filed by State of Uttar Pradesh against the Allahabad High Court judgment that declared that Regulation 101 framed under the Intermediate Education Act, 1921 is unconstitutional. The court added that an institution can never be allowed to say that the grant of aid should be on its own terms.   The case of writ petitioners before the High Court against the impugned Regulation 101 was that (1) it is a clear violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India in filling the sanctioned post of Class "IV" employees alone by way of "Outsourcing" (2) Section 16G of the Act is sought to be impliedly overruled by the impugned regulation (3) The main regulation which affects the right to get aid violates the fundamental rights granted to minority institutions under Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India. The High Court accepted these contentions and ruled that regulation 101 is unconstitutional. Challenging this ruling, the State contended before the Apex Court that the institutions being the recipients of aid are bound by the conditions attached, as there exists neither a fundamental right to receive aid nor a vested one.  Allowing the appeal, the judgment authored by Justice MM Sundresh contains the following significant observations: 32. When it comes to aided institutions, there cannot be any difference between a minority and non-minority one. Article 30 of the Constitution of India is subject to its own restrictions being reasonable. A protection cannot be expanded into a better right than one which a non-minority institution enjoys. Law has become quite settled on this issue and therefore does not require any elaboration.  Decision to grant aid is by way of policy  29. A decision to grant aid is by way of policy. While doing so, the government is not only concerned with the interest of the institutions but the ability to undertake such an exercise. There are factors which the government is expected to consider before taking such a decision. Financial constraints and deficiencies are the factors which are considered relevant in taking any decision qua aid, including both the decision to grant aid and the manner of disbursement of an aid.  31. Once we hold that right to get an aid is not a fundamental right, the challenge to a decision made in implementing it, shall only be on restricted grounds. Therefore, even in a case where a policy decision is made to withdraw the aid, an institution cannot question it as a matter of right. Maybe, such a challenge would still be available to an institution, when a grant is given to one institution as against the other institution which is similarly placed. Therefore, with the grant of an aid, the conditions come. If an institution does not want to accept and comply with the conditions accompanying such aid, it is well open to it to decline the grant and move in its own way. On the contrary, an institution can never be allowed to say that the grant of aid should be on its own terms.  33. Thus, on the aforesaid issue we have no hesitation in reiterating the principle that an institution receiving aid is bound by the conditions imposed and therefore expected to comply. Once we hold so, the challenge made on various grounds, falls to the ground.   In this regard, the court referred to judgments in T.M.A. Pai Foundation vs. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481 and SK Md. Rafique vs. Management Committee Contai Rahamania High Madrasah (2020) 6 SCC 689 . Challenge to a regulation stands on a different footing  The court noted that the amendment to the Regulation 101 is a policy decision in the form of subordinate legislation. In this regard, the court observed thus: 37.A policy decision is presumed to be in public interest, and such a decision once made is not amenable to challenge, until and unless there is manifest or extreme arbitrariness, a constitutional court is expected to keep its hands off.38.A challenge to a regulation stands on a different footing than the one that can be made to an enactment. However, when the regulation is nothing but a reiteration of a policy reinforcing the decision of the Government made earlier,  then the parameters required for testing the validity of an Act are expected to be followed by the Court.39.An executive power is residue of a legislative one, therefore the exercise of said power i.e., the amendment of the impugned regulation, cannot be challenged on the basis of mere presumption. Once a rule is introduced by way of a policy decision, a demonstration on the existence of manifest, excessive and extreme arbitrariness is needed. "Outsourcing" cannot be declared as ultra vires of the constitution on the basis of mere presumption and assumption The court noted that "Outsourcing" as a matter of policy is being introduced throughout the State.  "It is one thing to say that it has to be given effect to with caution as recommended by the Seventh Central Pay Commission, and another to strike it down as unconstitutional. "Outsourcing" per se is not prohibited in law. It is clear that a recruitment by way of "Outsourcing" may have its own deficiencies and pit falls, however, a decision to take "Outsourcing" cannot be  declared as ultra vires of the constitution on the basis of mere presumption and assumption. Obviously, we do not know the nature of the scheme and safeguards attached to it.." One cannot simply presume that "Outsourcing" as a method of recruitment would necessarily be adopting contract labour and that there exists an element of unfair trade practice, as sought to be contended by the respondents Article 14 does not prohibit valid discrimination Article 14 is positive in nature. Adequate leverage is to be provided to the law maker in making the classification. Article 14 of the Constitution of India does not prohibit discrimination, what is required is a valid discrimination against a hostile one Persons who challenged has to satisfy 'Unconstitutionality' When a challenge is made either to a regulation, rule or an Act, it is for the persons who challenged, to satisfy the Court that they cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. Such a challenge has to be considered within the contours of law. Mere fact that a counsel representing the State is not able to satisfy the Court on the policy challenged would not ipso facto lead to a declaration that it is unconstitutional. (Para 51) Concept of "always speaking" as a principle of interpretation The concept of "always speaking" as a principle of interpretation is to be applied for a proper understanding of an old enactment. After all, such a statute having its intended object which certainly includes regulating the functions of aided institutions requires to be interpreted to deal with the past, present and future situations. Therefore, an interpretation which is reasonable, constructive and purposive would serve the purpose While setting aside the High Court judgment, the court also directed the state to undertake the necessary exercise to ensure there is a mechanism available for the proper implementation of "Outsourcing".

Denying bail to a man accused of raping his fiancé multiple times on the pretext of their planned marriage, the Delhi High Court has observed that mere fact of being engaged does not mean that the accused can sexually assault, beat or threaten her. Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma made the observation while rejecting the argument made on behalf of the accused that since the parties were engaged, it cannot be said that there was false promise of marriage. "However, in this Court's opinion, the argument has no force, since the mere fact of being engaged did not mean that the accused could have sexually assaulted, beaten or threatened the victim," the court said in an order dated September 22.  The court also noted that as per the victim's statement, the sexual relation established on the first occasion was also on the pretext of marriage. The FIR was registered on July 16 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Charge Sheet was filed in the case on September 16.  The victim had alleged that after being friends with the accused since October 2020 and having been together for almost a year, they got engaged on October 11 last year with the consent of their family members.  As per the FIR, four days after the engagement, the accused forcibly established physical relationship with the victim on the pretext that they were engaged to each other and would be getting married soon.  Further, the petitioner was accused of having mercilessly beaten the victim, in an intoxicated state. He allegedly established a non-consensual physical relationship with her on several occasions, which allegedly even resulted in her pregnancy. The victim was given pills by the accused to abort the pregnancy in February this year, as per the FIR. The FIR further alleges that on July 9, when the victim went to the house of the accused, he and his family members refused to solemnise the marriage, which led to filing of the complaint.  Calling the allegations made by the victim regarding forcible abortion by administration of pills as 'very serious', the court said: "A woman who was yet unmarried may not have kept the evidence of same for reasons to save her honour." Perusing the victim's statement recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) as well as the charge sheet, the Court observed that the allegations levelled by the prosecutrix were serious in nature which showed that she had been sexually assaulted and raped on several occasions by the accused on false pretext of marriage. "Thus, considering the seriousness of the offence, the nature of allegations and the fact that the charges have not been framed yet and trial is yet to commence, this is not a fit case for grant of bail," the court said.

The Gauhati High Court rejected the prayer for interim orders in a plea challenging notification dated 18.08.2022 temporarily suspending mobile internet connectivity during State recruitment examination. The impugned order was issued by the Principal Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department, invoking the power conferred under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 read with Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. It had mandated that, on 21.08.2022 and 28.08.2022, mobile internet services will remain suspended for 4 hours in 24 districts which had centres of written examination for filling up approximately 30,000 posts for Grade-III and Grade-IV services in different departments in the State. The measure was claimed to have been adopted to facilitate a free, fair and transparent conduct of the examination by curbing mobile phone-enabled cheating.  The counsel for the petitioner argued that the notification violated the exercise of fundamental rights guaranteed to her client under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India and that, under the provisions of Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, internet services could not be suspended so as to prevent cheating in the examination halls. She contended that the only recourse in such suspension of this right was in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19(2) of the Constitution, which, she asserted, had not been followed in the present case.  Heavily relying on Supreme Court rulings in Anuradha Bhasin Vs. Union of India and People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) vs. Union of India and another, she argued that since temporary suspension of internet services directly infringed upon the fundamental right of her client, this was a fit case for the Court to not only interfere with the impugned notification, but to pass an interim order suspending its operation.  The Advocate General, Assam submitted that the State had come up with elaborate arrangements on the basis of Standard Operative Procedure to ensure a free, fair and malpractice-free recruitment process and that the temporary suspension of the mobile data services had been adopted only as the last option.  It was argued that such a measure had to be adopted by the State after putting in place other measures. He pointed out that the government had taken a stringent measure keeping in mind the onslaught of question paper leakages in the few recruitment processes held in the State of Assam over the past several years. He added that it was not technically feasible to selectively suspend mobile data services only in those areas where examination centres were located. He added that broadband and cable enabled internet services would remain uninterrupted. He pointed out that mobile internet services would be suspended on a Sunday afternoon, for a specific period only.   The Advocate General also referred to the decision in Anuradha Bhasin, to submit that the recourse adopted by the State was both permissible and justified in the facts and circumstances of the case. He contended that the petition was liable to be dismissed since there was nothing on record to indicate as to whether the petitioner had a mobile phone or if he was using a mobile data service. To this, the counsel for the petitioner responded that the petitioner was personally aggrieved since his mobile services were not working due to suspension of the data card.  The Court stated that the question as to whether mobile data services could be temporarily suspended to curb cheating would not be possible to examine unless the State files an affidavit bringing its stand, along with documents, on record. To this end, a notice was issued which was accepted by the senior Government Advocate, Assam.   The Court stated that the petitioner had failed to make a case on facts in support of his prayer for interim relief. Keeping in mind that the suspension of data services was not to be extended to the examination scheduled to be held on 11.09.2022 and that some disruption may be caused to the conduct of the examination, the Court rejected the prayer for interim orders.

The Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur has observed that in a public interest litigation, the petitioner is not absolved of producing at least a basic proof of the allegations levelled by him.  A division bench of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice Sudesh Bansal, observed,  "Even otherwise we find the petition with long pleadings are long in averments but short in contents. The allegations made in the petition would require supporting evidence. Even in a public interest petition the petitioner is not absolved of producing at least a basic proof of his allegations."  The present public interest litigation was filed by one Lakhpat Ola, alleging that certain officials of the Government have embezzled public funds by committing irregularities in public works contracts.  The allegations include irregular payments in execution of the construction work of one Gaurav Path at Sikar during which according to the petitioner unauthorized over payments were made.  The court opined that it when it comes to allegations of corruption in public life, it would certainly view the allegations seriously and deal with them with caution. The court added that without any supporting materials and particularly when the reply filed by the Government which covers and denies all averments of the petitioner has remained uncontroverted, courts can't propose to carry this public interest petition any further.  The court observed that since two and half years of filing of the reply, the petitioner has not filed any rejoinder disputing any of the averments made in the reply filed by the respondents.  Notably, the state authorities appeared and filed a reply dated 30.08.2019 dealing with each and every allegation of the petitioner and pointing out that the work as per the contract awarded or in some cases the extra work as needed was carried out and payments were made only after due verification and satisfaction of the authorities.  Adv. Saransh Saini appeared for the petitioner while AAG Rajesh Maharshi appeared for the respondents.  Case Title: Lakhpat Ola v. State of Rajasthan

While upholding a Divorce decree, the Kerala High Court recently observed that not taking treatment for mental issues in order to bring out a peaceful and harmonious family atmosphere, amounts to cruelty to the persons at the receiving end i.e., the Spouse. Since the couple in question hail from the Christian Community and the issue before the Court was related to as to what would constitute mental cruelty, the Bench of Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Sophy Thomas remarked thus: "Law cannot recognise different varieties of cruelty as Hindu cruelty, Muslim cruelty, Christian cruelty or secular cruelty to justify a decree for divorce...The concept of matrimonial cruelty to entitle a spouse for divorce can't be dissimilar and different for persons belonging to different religious faiths merely because of different words being used in the relevant personal law statutes governing divorce matters." The case in brief The appellant (Wife) and respondent (Husband), a Christian couple, got married as per the Christian rites and ceremonies in October 1988, and out of this wedlock, two girl children were born.  The husband (respondent herein), who is an Engineer cum Yoga Trainer filed an application before the Family Court, Ernakulam to dissolve their marriage under Section 10 of the Divorce Act, alleging cruelties, both mental and physical, and desertion, from the part of the wife, who is a Post Graduate. The husband alleged that, from the very inception of marriage, the wife was showing behavioral disorders. She was intolerable even on minor domestic problems and she was abusive and assaultive in nature. She did not give proper attention to the children.  Further, he alleged that she often threatened the husband that she would slice his throat and even strangulated him during sleep. Whenever he did not accede to her demand for unnatural sex, she threatened to slice away his penis. She often threatened him with suicide, and once she jumped out of a running car. Though she was taken to various psychologists and psychiatrists, she was not cooperating with the treatment. In July 2005, she returned to her paternal house, and thereafter, she never came back to live with her husband and children.  Hearing both the parties, the Family Court granted a decree of divorce in favor of the Husband on the ground of cruelty and desertion.  Challenging the said judgment and decree, the wife filed an appeal before the High Court alleging that, by the impugned judgment, the husband was given an incentive for his own cruelty and desertion. Court's order At the outset, the Court noted that the respondent (Husband) had a case that the appellant (wife) was having some behavioral problems and she was taken to various psychologists and psychiatrists for treatment, however, the wife claimed that she had no mental problem but had only mental stress and strain, due to the matrimonial cruelties she was subjected to, by her husband and mother-in-law. Further, the Court observed, that as per her own testimony, she was having some behavioral disorders which created troubles in her family life and she was not continuing her treatment, so as to lead a normal family life with her husband and children.  Agaisnt this backdrop, the Court noted thus: "One may suffer mental stress or strain due to very many reasons. But, not taking treatment for the same in order to bring out a peaceful and harmonious family atmosphere, also may have to be counted as cruelty to the persons at the receiving end. The appellant has no case that, she had any difficulty to continue the treatment, but according to her, she had no psychiatric problem and so she discontinued the treatment. The doctor gave testimony to the effect that, the impulse control disorder, will definitely affect a normal family life. If proper treatment is given, it can be brought under control." On the question as to what would constitute mental cruelty, the Court opined that there cannot be any comprehensive definition of the concept of 'mental cruelty' within which all kinds of cases of mental cruelty can be covered.  Further, since the couple in question hail from the Christian community and the primary question before the Court was about whether the wife had indeed inflicted mental cruelty upon the husband which would be sufficient to sustain the divorce decree, the Court observed thus: "It would be absolutely safe to draw inspiration from Art.44 of the Constitution also to jump to the conclusion that nature of cruelty justifying a decree for divorce cannot be different under different personal laws. To our mind, it appears that matrimonial cruelty must have a uniform definition or conceptualisation to justify the founding of a decree for divorce" Importantly, the Court also referred to Section 10 of the Indian Divorce Act, which is applicable to Christians and states that that cruelty must be such as to cause reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner, the spouse that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the respondent. In this regard, the Court said that the expression harmful or injurious cannot be limited to physical harm or injury and that anything that would hinder the ability of the spouse to blossom into his/ her fullness and to enjoy life in matrimony must be held to fall within the sweep of S.10(1)(x) of the Divorce Act.  "Cruelty which is not defined in S.13(1)(1a) of the Hindu Marriage Act and S.27(1) of the Special Marriage Act and cruelty which is explained in S.2(viii) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act and S.10(1)(x) of the Divorce Act must all take inspiration from such understanding of matrimonial cruelty," the Court added as it concluded that the Husband had amply proved that his wife had treated him with such cruelty as to cause reasonable apprehension in his mind that it would be harmful or injurious to him to live with the appellant. Therefore, the Court dismissed the wife's appeal as it came to the conclusion that the appellant was treating her husband with cruelty both physical and mental, and in the year 2005, she had deserted him.  "There is no merit in preserving intact a marriage, when the marital tie becomes injurious to the parties. When there is no rose, and only thorns left, and there is no scope for the plant to sprout again, there is no meaning in watering the same, knowing that it is dead for ever," the Court noted this while concluding. Case title - MARY MARGRET v. JOS P THOMASCase citation:  (Ker) 44   
In a significant judgment impacting lakhs of workers across the country, the Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Employees' Pension (Amendment) Scheme 2014, which, among other things, capped the maximum salary for joining the EPF Pension Scheme as Rs 15,000 per month with effect from September 1, 2014.  However, the Court has allowed an additional window of four months period for those who were members of the scheme before the 2014 amendment and whose salaries exceed the threshold introduced in 2014 to join the scheme by exercising the higher option. As per the 2014 amendment, members whose monthly salary exceeded Rs.15,000/- had to exercise a fresh option to join the scheme within a period of six months from September 1, 2014. Also, such employees had to make an additional contribution at the rate of 1.16 per cent on salary exceeding fifteen thousand rupees. This condition for additional contribution has also been invalidated by the Court on the ground that it is ultra vires the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952. On all other counts, the Court has approved the 2014 amendments, including the changes brought to the method of computation of pensionable salary. The Court clarified that the relaxations allowed by it in the judgment will not be available to employees who retired before September 1, 2014 without exercising the option. As per the 2014 amendment, employees who join service after September 1, 2014 are not eligible to join the pension scheme if their monthly salary is above Rs.15,000/-. Since this clause has not been interfered with by the Court, the benefit of the judgment will be available to only those who were members of the scheme as on September 1, 2014. Here are the reasons given by the bench of Chief Justice of India UU Lalit, Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia while allowing the appeals filed by the Employees Provident Fund Organization and the Union of India against the judgments of the Kerala, Rajasthan and Delhi High Courts which had quashed the 2014 amendments. Centre has power to make amendments; amendments made not whimsically The Court noted that Section 7 of the EPF Act gives power to the Central Government to modify the pension scheme prospectively or retrospectively. Also, Paragraph 32 of the Pension Scheme authorises the Centre to make alterations. "We find that the amendment was made in exercise of power otherwise vested in the authority making such amendment and the amendments were made on the basis of certain relevant materials and not whimsically", the judgment authored by Justice Bose stated. The EPFO told the Court that the provident fund and pension fund are distinct. While provident fund scheme entails a one­time settlement in favour of the member, the pension scheme carries, by its very nature, benefits for an unspecified time, which has to be based on actuarial calculation. The EPFO produced an actuarial report of December 2018 in which the net liability of the fund is projected to be Rs.5,75,918.88/­ crores for the pension fund, exclusive of the provident fund balance that might be transferred.  Employees of pension scheme not a homogeneous class; authorities can make classifications based on salary The Court rejected the argument of the employees that the pension scheme considers employees as a homogenous group and no distinction can be made among different categories of employees based on their monthly salary. "It is well within the power and authority of the statutory authorities to reasonably classify different sets of employees and categorise them for the nature of benefits they might get from an existing scheme", the Court observed. "In our view, classification of the employees made by the authorities on the basis of the salary drawn in the 2014 amendment meets the test of reasonable classification contemplated in Article 14 of the Constitution of India", the Court held. The Court highlighted that when the scheme was launched in 1995, it was made applicable to only those drawing wages upto Rs.5000/­. The provision relating to exercising option for those drawing salary above the threshold was introduced later, in the year 1996. The EPFO had argued that the pension fund was introduced for the benefit of low-scale employees and if employees drawing higher salaries are allowed to draw pension in proportion to their salaries, it will create huge imbalance within the fund. Limited scope of judicial review The Kerala High Court, in coming to its finding that the amendment was arbitrary, based its reasoning on macroeconomic factors like general increase in salary, addition to the base of the fund and the negative impact on denial of pension benefits for a large number of employees. The High Court had observed that Rs.15,000/- monthly income was a very low threshold as a manual labourer will also get at least Rs 500 as daily wages. Therefore, the High Court expressed the concern that the 2014 amendment will deprive several low-scale workers of pensionary benefits. Though the Supreme Court did not completely discard the concerns expressed by the High Court, it said that such considerations are within the policy domain and outside the scope of judicial review. "We are alive to the concern expressed by the High Court as regards impact on the economic stability of retired employees suddenly being deprived of pension. But, based on such macro­level social disparities, we do not think in exercise of judicial power we can require the State to operate a pension scheme in a particular manner. These factors would be for the policy makers to examine and prescribe. We cannot issue directions on the Central Government to work out statutory scheme in a particular fashion". Condition for additional contribution by employee invalid The requirement in the scheme for employee's contribution to the extent of 1.16 per cent for option members was held to be illegal. This is for the reason that the parent Act, the EPF Act 1952, does not require contribution from the employees' side. "There is nothing in the 1952 Act which requires payment to the pension fund by an employee. Section 6A of the Act also does not have any such stipulation. Since the Act does not contemplate any contribution to be made by an employee to remain in the scheme, the Central Government under the scheme itself cannot mandate such a stipulation". Without a legislative amendment, such a condition cannot be imposed on the employee. However, the Court suspended this part of the judgment for a period of 6 months to enable the Centre to explore legislative amendments. "We shall, however, suspend the operation of this part of our judgment for a period of six months so that the legislature may consider the necessity of bringing appropriate legislative amendment on this count. For the aforesaid period, the scheme as it stands shall continue. Till such time, if no such legislative exercise is undertaken, the duty to contribute 1.16 per cent of the salary shall apply on option members as well. This contribution shall be adjusted depending on any amendment that may be brought. For the period of six months, however, the opting employees shall make payment of 1.16 per cent contribution as stop gap measure. In the event no amendment to the statute or the scheme is made within such extended time, then the administrators of the fund will have to operate the pension fund for the option members from out of the existing corpus".  No flaw in altering the basis for computation of pensionable salary As per the 2014 amendment, computation of pensionable salary is based on average monthly pay of the period of 60 months preceding the exit of the employee. Before the amendment, this span was 12 months preceding the exit. This, according to EPFO, has been done to achieve a clearer picture of the pensionable salary to eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in pay drawn in the last 12 months for determining the quantum of pension. The EPFO illustrated the cases of manual labourers and women who drawing low wages, who may suffer such fluctuation on account of ill health, incapacitation, etc., and in the case of such employees, if only 12 months' pay is accounted for, they may get reduced pension. The Court accepted this justification and said : "There is a reasonable basis for effecting change in the computation methodology for determining pensionable salary and we do not find any illegality or unconstitutionality in effecting this amendment". Accepts RC Gupta decision which held that there could be no cut-off for option The judgment accepted the verdict given by a division bench in 2016 in the case RC Gupta vs Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (2016) as regards interpretation to paragraph 11(3) of the pre-amended scheme. In that judgment, it was held that the date specified in paragraph 11(3) of the pre-amended scheme cannot be construed as a cut-off date. Based on this decision, the Court held : "The dual option, as is contemplated in paragraph 11(4) of the pension scheme (post 2014 amendment), has to be merged into one. In the event the employer and employee jointly opt for coverage beyond the salary limit of Rs. 15000/­, without giving an earlier option under the unamended Clause 11(3) of the pension scheme, they would not be automatically excluded from their right to exercise option under paragraph 11(4) of the scheme, post amendment."  Amendment applicable to exempted establishments The Court held that the 2014 amendment shall apply to the employees of the exempted establishments in the same manner as the employees of the regular establishments. The provident funds of exempted establishments are managed by their own trusts instead of the EPFO. "The employees of exempted establishments are integrated into the pension scheme and we are of the opinion that the employees of an exempted establishment should not be deprived of the benefit of getting option to remain in the pension scheme while drawing salary beyond the ceiling limit, in situations where similarly situated employees of unexempted establishments can exercise such option. In the event the scheme is construed in a way which would exclude them, that would lead to artificial classification of otherwise same categories of employees. Thus, the pension scheme ought to apply to the employees of the exempted establishments in the same manner as this scheme applies to the employees of unexempted or regular establishments".  In order to be entitled to the benefits of the pension fund, the employer and the employee, simultaneously with exercising option in terms of the order of this Court, shall also have to give an undertaking of transferring the employers' contribution at the stipulated rate maintained by the trusts, which shall be equivalent to and not lower than the sum which would have been transferable, had such fund been maintained by the provident fund authorities. S Other directions : The employees who had exercised option under the proviso to paragraph 11(3) of the 1995 scheme and continued to be in service as on 1st September 2014, will be guided by the amended provisions of paragraph 11(4) of the pension scheme.  All the employees who did not exercise option but were entitled to do so but could not due to the interpretation on cut­off date by the authorities, ought to be given a further chance to exercise their option. Time to exercise option under paragraph 11(4) of the scheme, under these circumstances, shall stand extended by a further period of four months Rest of the requirements as per the amended provision shall be complied with.  The employees who had retired prior to 1st September 2014 without exercising any option under paragraph 11(3) of the pre­amendment scheme have already exited from the membership thereof. They would not be entitled to the benefit of this judgment. The employees who have retired before 1st September 2014 upon exercising option under paragraph 11(3) of the 1995 scheme shall be covered by the provisions of the paragraph 11(3) of the pension scheme as it stood prior to the amendment of 2014.

The Calcutta High Court, while upholding the ruling of the Orissa Appellate Authority, held that the classification of polypropylene bags cannot be changed just to avail a lower tariff rate. The single Justice Md. Nizamuddin has observed that the polypropylene bags manufactured by the petitioner are made from plastic granules and cannot be treated as textile articles. The assessee/petitioner is a manufacturer of polypropylene leno bags by weaving polypropylene strips (tapes). Polypropylene is a variety of plastic. The major raw material in the manufacture of PP Leno bags is plastic granules. The petitioner, before the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, had voluntarily declared its finished product under Chapter Heading 3923-29-90 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, and enjoyed the duty drawback. No cogent reason has been shown by the petitioner as to why and how the tariff heading of the product having the same composition and involving the same process of manufacturing sought to be changed from classification 3923 29 90 to 6305 33 00, except that the rate of tax on the product under the same tariff heading is higher under the newly implemented GST regime. The petitioners filed an application for advance ruling in Form GST ARA-01 before the West Bengal Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) seeking an advance ruling on the classification of PP Leno Bag under Chapter Heading 63053300 of the Tariff. The AAR held that the PP Leno Bags being manufactured by the petitioner can be classified under Chapter Heading 63053300 of the Tariff if the same are made from woven polypropylene fabric using strips not exceeding a width of 5 mm and without any impregnation, coating, covering, or lamination with plastics. The CGST authority concerned preferred to appeal before the West Bengal Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) against the order of the The Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling set aside the order passed by the AAR and allowed the appeal filed by the CGST authority. Pursuant to the order of the AAR, the petitioner made "under protest" payments of differential tax amounting to Rs. 6,57,38,093 for the period 1 July, 2017 to 23 November, 2018. Before the introduction of the GST regime, the rates of duty under Tariff Headings 3923-29-90 and 6305-33-00 both 12.5%. However, in the present regime of GST, the rate of tax under the Tariff Heading 3923-29-90 is 18%, and under the Tariff Heading 6305-33-00, it is 5% or 12%, depending upon the sale value of the products and whether they exceed Rs.1000 per piece or not. The petitioner contended that, though it is manufactured from plastic, since it is less than 5 mm in width, it should be treated as a textile product. However, prior to the introduction of the GST regime of classification, the petitioner claimed the same product, with the same composition and manufactured using the same procedure, for a long time as plastic products, and the petitioner never argued that the classification was incorrect. The Court stated that it is not inclined to allow the petitioner to change the classification of the tariff heading to avail itself of a lower rate of tariff under the GST regime when the product of the petitioner is Polypropylene Leno Bags manufactured by weaving Polypropylene strips, the major raw material of which is plastic granules. Before the introduction of the GST regime, the petitioner had been declaring the product under Chapter 3923 29 90 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, and enjoying the duty drawback; he never contended before the authority, until the introduction of the GST law, that its classification was wrong.

The Calcutta High Court has recently underscored that dismissal or removal or reduction in the rank of a person employed in a civil capacity under the Union or State must not be done without following due process and in violation of the principles of natural justice.  A Division Bench comprising Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya and Justice Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee thus proceeded to quash the impugned orders of the Central Administrative Tribunal as well as the Appellate Authority and also directed the respondent authorities to release pensionary and other retirement benefits to the petitioner within a period of 6 weeks.  Background  The Court was adjudicating upon a plea by a 67-year-old widow of one late C. Mathai, a Sub-Inspector in the Andaman and Nicobar Police Department who had been dismissed from service on December 20, 2007 by the Director General of Police, Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Disciplinary Authority).  The issue in consideration before the Bench was whether Article 311(2)(b) of the Constitution of India could have been invoked by the Disciplinary Authority for summarily dismissing the petitioner's husband and whether the order could have been sustained by the Appellate Authority.  For context, Article 311 of the Constitution pertains to the dismissal, removal, or reduction in rank of any person employed in civil capacities under the Union or a State and mandates that no person who is a member of the aforesaid or holds a civil post under the Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed or reduced any rank except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of all the charges.  Observations  The Court observed that pursuant to the stipulations under Article 311(2) of the Constitution before dismissal it is mandatory to hold an inquiry and provide an opportunity of hearing. It was further held that an exception will only hold ground if it is impracticable to hold the inquiry and the onus is on the authority to record its satisfaction in writing as to the reason for the impracticability.  Enumerating further on the constitutional obligation under Article 311, the Court opined,   "The underlying presumption in Article 311 is that dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of a person employed in a civil capacity under the Union or State is not to be taken lightly or done without following due process. The threshold to prove dispensation of due process and compliance with the principles of natural justice is high in all matters but particularly heightened in Article 311(2)(b) of the Constitution of India. In essence, the constitutional obligation of recording reasons for departing from the norm must strictly be conformed with."  Pertinently, the Bench also remarked that the order of dismissal passed by the Disciplinary Authority in the instant case also reflects the existing ethics of society in general and the police force in particular.  Emphasizing that the invocation of power under Article 311 (2)(b) of the Constitution has been based on unproved presumptions, the Court remarked further,  "Not a single instance has been cited or relied upon to show that the "intimidation or common experience" with regard to witnesses deposing against delinquents actually took place with regard to the petitioner's husband. The justification is that "this kind of intimidation is a common tactic adopted by the unscrupulous police personnel". There is no reference to whether any such threat or intimidation was made by the petitioner's husband on proposed or probable witnesses. The conclusion arrived at of "compelling circumstances" for invoking Article 311(2)(b) is wholly unsupported by facts or even a credible justification."  The Court also noted that the impugned order of the Appellate Authority merely parrots the view of the Disciplinary Authority and that too after 11 years as the appeal was filed back in January 2008.  The Bench also observed with dismay that it is 'shocking' that the Appellate Authority had failed to refer to the judgment of the Special Court whereby the petitioner's husband was found not guilty of the offence punishable under The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  Dismissing the contention that the holding of a departmental inquiry was not possible as mandated under Article 311(2)(b) of the Constitution since the complainant had turned hostile under the influence of the petitioner's husband, the Court observed,  "The position taken is that the departmental inquiry was not feasible since the complainant turned hostile reflecting the influence of Mr. Mathai. This is entirely unacceptable to us since no connection has been established between the power exerted by the petitioner's husband, if at all, and the complainant turning hostile. In any event, the complainant turning hostile is a event subsequent to the order of dismissal and hence cannot be a material reason for circumventing due process before passing the order of dismissal."  Accordingly, the Court set aside the order of the Disciplinary Authority dated 20th December 2017 and the order Appellate Authority dated 10/17th September 2018.   In order to do complete justice to the petitioner, the Court also directed the respondent authorities to release the pensionary and other retirement benefits which would have accrued to the petitioner's husband on his date of retirement within a period of six weeks after taking into account that she was a widow who had suffered the agony of her husband's unjust dismissal.   Case Title: Kunjumole v. The Union of India and others     
Punjab and Haryana High Court has reiterated that the report of Forensic Science Lab forms the foundation of prosecution case in NDPS proceedings and in case the same is not there the entire case of prosecution falls to ground. In a plea seeking default bail for want of FSL report, despite filing of chargesheet, Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill observed, "A case under the NDPS Act can only survive in case the prosecution is able to establish that the article recovered is indeed a contraband and which can only be established on the basis of its chemical examination, which is normally got done through FSL established by the Government." The bench drew a contrast with cases of injury, hurt or murder under IPC, where it said that even the ocular version coupled with some medical evidence or some other circumstantial evidence may suffice to bring home the guilt of the accused. It also noted that the Supreme Court as well as a full Bench of the High Court have held that a challan even if not accompanied by a report of the Chemical Examiner or of the expert cannot be said to be incomplete. However, it highlighted that those cases did not pertain to an offence under the NDPS Act. Furthermore, the Court observed that the controversy has been referred to a Division Bench and is still subjudice, in view of several conflicting judgments. Meanwhile, several co-ordinate Benches have granted bail to the accused.Accordingly, the High Court granted relief to the instant petitioner.Brief facts of the case are, an FIR was registered against the petitioner under Sections 21(b)/27-A/29/61/85 of the NDPS Act alleging that he was found in possession of 15 grams of 'Heroin'. After investigation by the police, a report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was presented before the trial Court but the report was not accompanied by the report of FSL.   Mandatory period of 60 days for filing of challan in cases of recovery of non-commercial quantity of contraband, as per provisions of the NDPS Act read with Section 167 Cr.P.C. expired on 10.4.2022 and the prosecution did not file the FSL report even by the said date. As a consequence, the petitioner moved an application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. for bail on the ground that in absence of FSL report, challan could not be said to be complete. The said application was dismissed. Hence the the instant petition.  After considering submission of parties, the court extend the concession of bail in terms of Section 167(2) CrPC to the petitioner while also keeping in view the fact that the petitioner has been behind bars since the last more than 9 months.

A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday held that both the Centre and the State have concurrent powers to fix the prices of sugarcane.

A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday held that both the Centre and the State have concurrent powers to fix the prices of sugarcane. At the same time, the  price' fixed by the State Government for sugarcane cannot be lower than the 'minimum price' fixed by the centre, the Court added. Also, it is open to the States to fix the price higher than the price fixed by the Centre. A 5-judge bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra, Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M R Shah and S Ravindra Bhat was deciding whether there was any conflict between Ch. Tika  Ramji & Others, Etc. vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Others [AIR 1956 SC 676] and U.P. Cooperative Cane Unions Federations vs. West U.P. Sugar Mills Association and Others [(2004)5 SCC 430]. The bench concluded that there was no conflict between these two decisions, and therefore held that there was no need for reference to a 7-judge bench. The bench had reserved its judgment on the limited issue of reference to a larger bench on February 27. The issue in the case was whether the State of U.P. has the authority to fix the State Advised Price (SAP) for sugarcane over and above the minimum price fixed by the Central Government. While considering the issue in 2012, a 3-judge bench felt that there was conflict between Tika Ramji and UP Cooperative Cane Unions Federations and referred the matter to five-judge bench. Answering the reference, the 5-judge bench noted that the factual matrix of both the decisions were different. In Tika Ramji, the court held that the appropriate government to fix the price of sugarcane was the Central Government as per Clause 3 of the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1955 issued under the Essential Commodities Act. Later, the 1955 order was substituted by the Central Government with another order issued in 1966. In the 1966 Order  from the word "price and the minimum price", word "price" came to be deleted and the power to fix "minimum price" came to be retained. It was the 1966 Order which came for consideration in the subsequent case UP Cooperative Cane Unions Federations. Taking note of the changes in the Sugarcane Order, the Court in that case held that the power retained by the Central Government was only to fix the 'minimum price', and that the State had the power to fix price over and above such 'minimum price' fixed by the Centre. In this backdrop, the present 5- judge bench held that there was no conflict between these decisions : "As held by this Court in the case of U.P. Cooperative Cane Unions Federations (supra), the State has the competence to determine and fix the State Advised Price fixed under  section 16 (of U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953) and therefore fixation of SAP by the State Government cannot be said to be beyond the purview of legislative competence. Once the fixation of State Advised Price has been done, the Cane Commissioner can direct the parties to follow the same as held in U.P. Cooperative Cane Growers Federation (supra). It cannot be said that fixation of price under the regulatory measure provided in section 16 suffers from arbitrariness, nor can it be termed to be uncanalised power. Thus, we are of the considered opinion that the decision in Tika Ramji (supra) is not in conflict with the decision in U.P. Cooperative Cane Unions Federations (supra) and the decision in the latter case is not required to be revisited by a larger Bench of seven Judges". The 5-judge bench summarized its conclusions as follows : By virtue of Entries 33 and 34 List III of seventh Schedule, both the Central Government as well as the State Government have the power to fix the price of sugarcane. The Central Government having exercised the power and fixed the "minimum price", the State Government cannot fix the "minimum price" of sugarcane. However, at the same time, it is always open for the State Government to fix the "advised price" which is always higher than the "minimum price", in view of the relevant provisions of the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, which has been issued in exercise of powers under Section 16 of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953;The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 which has been issued under Section 16 of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 confers power upon the State Government to fix the remunerative/advised price at which sugarcane can be bought or sold which shall always be higher than the minimum price fixed by the Central Government;Section 16 of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 is not repugnant to Section 3(2)(c) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and Clause 3 of the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 as, as observed hereinabove, the price which is fixed by the Central Government is the "minimum price" and the price which is fixed by the State Government is the "advised price" which is always higher than the "minimum price" fixed by the Central Government and therefore, there is no conflict. It is only in a case where the "advised price" fixed by the State Government is lower than the "minimum price" fixed by the Central Government, the provisions of the Central enactments will prevail and the "minimum price" fixed by the Central Government would prevail. So long as the "advised price" fixed by the State Government is higher than the "minimum price" fixed by the Central Government, the same cannot be said to be void under Article 254 of the Constitution of India.The view taken by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of U.P. Cooperative Cane Unions Federations vs. West U.P. Sugar Mills Association and Others is the correct law Case DetailsTitle : West UP Sugar Mills Association and others vs State of Uttar Pradesh and othersCase No : Civil Appeal No. 7508 of 2005Bench    : Justices Arun Mishra, Indira Banerjee, M R Shah, Vineet Saran and Ravindra Bhat.Appearances : Senior Advocates Jayanth Bhushan (for appellants), Senior Advocate Krishnan Venugopal (for State of UP)     Read Judgment    
The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently granted bail to an accused, incarcerated since over two years in connection with alleged offences under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. "Keeping in view the fact that the petitioner has been in custody for a period of 02 years, 09 months and 14 days and the trial is likely to take time, no useful purpose would be served by keeping the petitioner in detention any longer," Justice Alka Sarin said. The bench was dealing with a petition under Section 439 CrPC. The accused-Petitioner was booked under Section 21 (contravention in relation to manufactured drugs and preparations), 61 (Concealing illicit drugs or substances) of NDPS Act. The Court noted that there is no other case pending against the petitioner and he is a first-time offender. Further, out of eight prosecution witnesses only three stand examined. The case came up as a result of alleged recovery of 'heroin' from the petitioner's house in pursuance to a statement made by him. As per the FSL Report however, the ingredient of the recovered powder was found to be Tramadol Hydrochloride.  The Court after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, concluded that the accused be released on regular bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds/surety bonds to the satisfaction of the Illaqa Magistrate/Duty Magistrate/Trial Court concerned.  However, it stated that the Prosecution will always be at liberty to apply for cancellation of bail in case the petitioner is found to be misusing the concession of bail in any manner.  Case Title : Malook Singh v. State of Punjab   
Punjab and Haryana High Court recently came to the aid of a candidate who was denied appointment to the post of Police Constable citing criminal antecedents, on the ground that he was neither named in the alleged FIR, nor summoned or charge-sheeted. The bench comprising Justice Jaishree Thakur was informed that the alleged FIR was falsely registered against the father of the petitioner and others, in which all of them were later discharged. The police has also filed a cancellation report and the same has been accepted by the Court of Judicial Magistrate, the bench noted. It thus said, "The sole reason for denying appointment to the petitioner herein is on account of the fact that he was found involved in the aforesaid FIR. The respondents-State has not been able to establish that the petitioner was nominated as an accused or was arrested under the aforesaid FIR." The Court was of the view that the employer is well within his right to reject the candidature of a candidate if the Appointing Authority gets to know that criminal proceedings against a candidate is in progress.  It is trite to hold that the police force is a disciplined force and the employer is well within his right to reject the candidature of a candidate, where the Appointing Authority upon verification of character and antecedents of the candidate recommended for appointment comes to know that criminal proceedings against a candidate is in progress and the status of the case is reported to be either under investigation or challaned and charges framed.  It further added that if the candidate gets convicted, then too appointment shall be denied to him. The court further noted that in a case where the candidate is convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude or an offence punishable with imprisonment for three years or more, he/she shall not be considered for appointment.  The issue before the Court was whether the petitioner can be denied appointment to the post of Male Constable (General Duty) on the ground that he did not disclose the pendency of the criminal case at the time in his application form or the attestation form.  Coming on to the facts of the instant case, the court said, "On the asking of the Court whether any proceeding had been initiated against the petitioner under Section 82 Cr.P.C. or not, learned State counsel on instructions from Assistant Sub-Inspector Devi Dayal has answered in the negative. It would be worthwhile to note that over 61 persons had been named in the aforesaid FIR and the [proclamation] order could perhaps pertain to any of those not arrested. The trial Court had discharged few of the accused, who had been arrested and one of them is the father of the petitioner herein. The police has also filed a cancellation report and the same has been accepted by the Court of Judicial Magistrate." For the reasons recorded above, the court allowed the present writ petition and directed the Respondents to issue an appointment letter to the petitioner, within a period of eight weeks.  The petitioner is also held entitled to all the consequential benefits in the nature of seniority, pay, leave etc. with effect from the date, when person lower in the merit to him had been so appointed to the post of Constable in the same very process of selection. The Court however clarified that the petitioner shall not be paid the actual arrears of salary for the period in question. Case Title: JAGDEEP SINGH VERSUS STATE OF PUNJAB AND ANOTHER    
The Supreme Court on Thursday affirmed the death penalty awarded to Lakshar-e-Toiba militant Mohammed Arif for the 2000 Red Fort Attack case which resulted in the death of three persons including two army officers. The Court dismissed the review petition filed by him challenging his conviction and sentence. When there is challenge to the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India by acts of terrorism, such acts are taken as the most aggravating circumstances, the bench comprising Chief Justice UU Lalit, Justice S Ravindra Bhat and Justice Bela M Trivedi observed. The court added that this factor completely outweigh the factors which may even remotely be brought into consideration as mitigating circumstances on record. Background On 22.12.2000 some intruders started indiscriminate firing and gunned down three persons including two army Jawans belonging to 7th Rajputana Rifles. Mohd. Arif, admittedly a Pakistani national, was arrested on December 25, 2000 in this case. He was convicted by the trial court on October 24, 2005, and awarded death sentence on October 31, 2005. His death sentence was confirmed by the Delhi High Court by an order dated September 13, 2007. The apex court dismissed his appeal challenging the conviction on August 10, 2011, and his review petition was dismissed on August 28, 2011. Upholding the High Court's confirmation of Death Sentence Supreme Court by its earlier order had observed– "It was an attack on Mother India. This is apart from the fact that as many as three persons had lost their lives. The conspirators had no place in India. Appellant was a foreign national and had entered India without any authorization or even justification. This is apart from the fact that the appellant built up a conspiracy by practicing deceit and committing various other offences in furtherance of the conspiracy to wage war against India as also to commit murders by launching an unprovoked attack on the soldiers of Indian Army. We, therefore, have no doubts that death sentence was the only sentence in the peculiar circumstance of this case." However, in 2016, the Supreme Court decided to re-hear his review petition based after the verdict which held that review petitions filed in death sentence cases must be heard in open court. The apex court on April 28, 2014 had stayed Arif's execution in the case. Grounds in Review Petition The following grounds were raised in the review petition: (a) The concerned Courts committed error in allowing call records to be admitted in evidence, in the absence of an appropriate certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. (b) The disclosure statements of the review petitioner must be taken to be inadmissible on account of illtreatment meted out to him during the intervening night between his actual arrest and his formal arrest.  (c) The recovery of ammunition or the encounter of one Abu Shamal, who was stated to be the accomplice of the petitioner, at Batla House, New Delhi, could not be associated with the disclosure statement of the review petitioner.  (d) Any possibility of retribution and rehabilitation of the review petitioner, or that he would continue to be a threat to the society, was not considered by the Courts.  Anvar P.V. as clarified in Arjun Panditrao is the law declared on Section 65B of the Evidence Act The bench observed that the decision in Anvar P.V. as clarified in Arjun Panditrao is the law declared on Section 65B of the Evidence Act. In Anvar, it was held that in the case of CD, VCD, chip, etc., the same shall be accompanied by the certificate in terms of Section 65-B obtained at the time of taking the document, without which, the secondary evidence pertaining to that electronic record, is inadmissible. Approving this view, the court in Arjun Panditrao clarified that certificate under Section 65-B(4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is produced. The court therefore observed: Consequently, we must eschew, for the present purposes, the electronic evidence in the form of CDRs which was without any appropriate certificate under Section 65-B(4) of the Evidence Act...even after eschewing circumstances 'h' and 'j' which were directly attributable to the CDRs relied upon by the prosecution, the other circumstances on record do clearly spell out and prove beyond any doubt the involvement of the review petitioner in the crime in question Direct attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India One of the grounds taken in the review petition was that the possibility of retribution and rehabilitation of the convict, or that he would continue to be a threat to the society, was not considered by the Courts while awarding/confirming the death sentence. The Centre submitted that the cases involving acts of terror which challenge the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India can only be adequately compensated by awarding the death sentence. "There is nothing on record which can be taken to be a mitigating circumstance in favour of the review petitioner. The suggestion that there is a possibility of retribution and rehabilitation, is not made out from and supported by any material on record. On the other hand, the aggravating circumstances evident from the record and specially the fact that there was a direct attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India, completely outweigh the factors which may even remotely be brought into consideration as mitigating circumstances on record.", the court observed.

Union of India & Ors. The supreme court held... The Delhi High Court has set aside the proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 against Indiabulls Housing and Finance Limited (IHFL) and its employees. The division bench of Justice Anish Dayal and Justice Mukta Gupta relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary & Ors Vs. Union of India & Ors. The supreme court held that authorities under the PMLA cannot resort to action against any person for money laundering on the assumption that the property recovered by them must be proceeds of crime and that a scheduled offence has been committed. The scheduled offence must be registered with the jurisdictional police or pending inquiry by way of complaint before the competent forum. In the event that there is already a registered scheduled offence but the person named in the criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence is finally absolved by a court of competent jurisdiction owing to an order of discharge, acquittal or quashing of the criminal case of the scheduled offence, there can be no action for money laundering against not only such a person but also any person claiming through him in relation to the property linked to the stated scheduled offence. The court quashed the proceedings while noting that the Bombay High Court had quashed the scheduled offence on the basis of which the ECIR was registered, alleging offences under PMLA. The court noted that the order of the Bombay High Court was final and any other allegation against the accused in the FIR or any other person not accused in the FIR is a matter which would be for the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction to decide in an appropriate proceeding before that court. The petitioners have challenged the continuation of proceedings in relation to the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) issued by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) despite the predicate offence registered under FIR having been quashed by the judgement of the High Court of Bombay. The petitioners contended that the summons issued by the ED to various petitioners in respect of the ECIR, the Look Out Circular (LOC), and any other consequential proceedings emanating from the ECIR may be set aside. The department contended that the FIR still subsists since it has only been quashed by the petitioners before the Bombay High Court and not in toto. The department submitted that Section 66 allows the ED to give an opinion on the basis of information or material in their possession that provisions of any other law are being contravened and accordingly share the information with the appropriate authorities for necessary action. The petitioner contended that once the Bombay High Court has quashed the scheduled offence on the basis of which the ECIR was registered, alleging offences under PMLA, the question of the ECIR's being sustained does not arise. The petitioner stated that under Section 66(2) of the PMLA if any contravention is noticed by a person, at any stage if any facts are indeed found or discovered, the authorities would have the liberty to exercise their rights under applicable law and file a fresh FIR if so necessitated. The court set aside all proceedings arising from the ECIR and directed that there would be no further coercive action, search and seizure, or summons arising from the ECIR.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that the High Court of one State can grant transit bail in respect of a case registered within the jurisdiction of another High Court in the exercise of power under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. "...there is no fetter on the part of the High Court in granting a transit anticipatory bail to enable the applicants to approach the Courts including High Courts where the offence is alleged to have been committed and the case is registered," the Court stressed. With this, the bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan granted transit anticipatory bail to a man booked under Sections 406 & 420 IPC in connection with a case registered in Maharashtra.  For context, the concept of "transit anticipatory bail" comes into the picture when a person is apprehending arrest by police of a State other than the State where he/she is presently situated. As the word "transit" suggests, it is an act of being moved or carried from one place to another. In plain words, when an accused is arrested in accordance with the order of the court and whereas the accused needs to be tried in some other competent court having jurisdiction in the aforementioned matter, the accused is given bail for the transitory period i.e., the time period required for the accused to reach that competent court from the place he is arrested in. In the instant case, accused Ajay Agarwal is a businessman dealing with safety products, who has been implicated in a case registered in the state of Maharashtra related to some commercial transaction. He moved the Court with the instant plea with the submission that since the investigation is going on in Maharashtra, therefore, he is required to participate in such investigation in Maharashtra, and since, he is apprehensive of his arrest, thus, he should be granted transit bail till the time he applies for bail before the proper jurisdictional court. At the outset, the Court noted that transit bail is protection from arrest for a certain definite period as granted by the Court granting such transit bail. The Court stressed that the mere fact that an accused has been granted transit bail, does not mean that the regular court, under whose jurisdiction the case would fall, would extend such transit bail and would convert such transit bail into anticipatory bail.  The Court clarified that upon the grant of transit bail, the accused person, who has been granted such transit bail, has to apply for anticipatory bail before the regular court and such court would consider such plea anticipatory bail, on its own merits.  Now, against this backdrop, noting that the commercial transaction ensued between the applicants and the complainant and there are criminal cases lodged by the parties against each other and thus, the Court found it to be a fit case where the applicant should get the privilege of transit pre-arrest bail. Hence, the Court directed that in the event of arrest of applicant/Ajay Agarwal, he shall be released on transit bail on executing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of the like amount. This protection has been granted for a period of six weeks. Case title - Ajay Agarwal v. State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief Secy. Home Lko.

The Allahabad High Court has granted bail to Nizamuddin Khan, the State President of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in the UAPA case over his alleged connection with the banned organization Popular Front of India (PFI) and involvement in anti-national activities. Khan, who has been booked under sections 295A, 109, 120B, 201 I.P.C., and section 13 of UAPA, was arrested on September 27, 2022, from Aligarh allegedly with objectionable material and unconstitutional literature. As per the FIR, Khan has been accused of recruiting youth against the central and state governments and against the RSS with the support of the PFI. After his bail plea was rejected by Sessions Court in Aligarh, he moved to the High Court seeking regular bail. The #AllahabadHighCourt has granted bail to Nizamuddin Khan (@nizamsdpi), the State President of the Social Democratic Party of India (@sdpofindia) in the UAPA case over his alleged connection with banned organization #PFI and involvement in anti-national activities. pic.twitter.com/kD1mTiFTPv— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) January 21, 2023 Before the bench of Justice Ajit Singh, his counsel argued that there is no evidence on record, which could show that the applicant is involved in any anti-national activity nor did he hurt the religious sentiment of any community in any manner. It was further argued that he is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case with the ulterior intention of harassing him. It was lastly submitted that he has no criminal history and he is languishing in jail since 27.9.2022 and in case he is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail and will cooperate in the trial. Though the state counsel opposed his bail plea, the Court, keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence, complicity of the accused, severity of the punishment, and submissions of learned counsel for the parties, considering the law laid down in the case of Data Ram Vs. State of U.P. and others, 2018(3) SCC 22, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, found him entitled to be enlarged on bail during the pendency of the trial. Consequently, the Court ordered that he be released on bail on his executing a personal bond and furnishing two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.

While raising several questions at the Union Government's COVID vaccination policy and making a prima facie observation certain aspects of the policy are "arbitrary and irrational", the Supreme Court has taken efforts to clarify that it is not breaching the principle of separation of powers and that it is only performing a role envisaged by the Constitution. "Our Constitution does not envisage courts to be silent spectators when constitutional rights of citizens are infringed by executive policies", a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud, L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat observed in the suo moto case In Re Distribution of Essential Services and Supplies During Pandemic. "Judicial review and soliciting constitutional justification for policies formulated by the executive is an essential function, which the courts are entrusted to perform", the bench observed in the order which highlighted several issues in the Liberalized Vaccination Policy formulated by the Union Government. The order noted that courts across the globe have responded to constitutional challenges to executive policies that have directly or indirectly violated rights and liberties of citizens.  "Courts have often reiterated the expertise of the executive in managing a public health crisis, but have also warned against arbitrary and irrational policies being excused in the garb of the "wide latitude"to the executive that is necessitated to battle a pandemic", the order observed. The order referred to last year's decision in Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha vs State of Gujarat(which quashed the Factories Act notification relaxing labour laws) where the Court said that "policies to counteract a pandemic must continue to be evaluated from a threshold of proportionality to determine if they, inter alia, have a rational connection with the object that is sought to be achieved and are necessary to achieve them". "In grappling with the second wave of the pandemic, this Court does not intend to second-guess the wisdom of the executive when it chooses between two competing and efficacious policy measures. However, it continues to exercise jurisdiction to determine if the chosen policy measure conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons", it said. Asserting that it is only "assuming a dialogic jurisdiction", the bench said : "This Court is presently assuming a dialogic jurisdiction where various stakeholders are provided a forum to raise constitutional grievances with respect to the management of the pandemic. Hence, this Court would,under the auspices of an open court judicial process, conduct deliberations with the executive where justifications for existing policies would be elicited and evaluated to assess whether they survive constitutional scrutiny". The Court flagged several issues with the Centre's vaccine policy, and observed that the policy of paid vaccination to 18-44 years is prima facie "arbitrary and irrational". The Court also sought to know how the budgetary allocation of Rs.35,000 crores have been spent to procure vaccines and why they can't be used to provide free vaccination to 18-44 years age group. Concerns were also raised about the "digital divide" in accessing Co-Win portal for getting vaccine slots. The Court has directed the Union Government to respond to the observations made by the bench by filing a fresh affidavit. The Court has also called for all relevant documents and file notings reflecting the thinking of the Centre on the vaccination policy. The Court directed the Union to undertake a "fresh review" of the vaccination policy in the light of the concerns raised by the Court. "We find that the the Liberalized Vaccination Policy may not be able to yield the desired results of spurring competitive prices and higher quantities of vaccines", the Court observed. The case will be next considered on June 30. How Rs 35000 Crores Budget Allocation Spent For Vaccines?Why Can't It Be Used To Vaccinate 18-44 Years Group?

The Gauhati High Court on Friday upheld the selection list prepared by Assam Public Service Commission (APSC) for filling up 162 posts in the category of Veterinary Officer/ Block Veterinary Officer which was challenged on the ground that the selection was done without conducting a written test. “It is no doubt correct that under Rule 4B the APSC would be required to hold a written competitive examination. However, Rule 4B would be applicable when the number of applicants is more than 5 (five) times the number of advertised vacancies, which is not the case in hand. It is correct that the number of applicants were more than 500, but as per Rule 4A, when the number of applicants is equal to or less than five times the number of vacancies, recruitment to such posts can be made only on the basis of oral interview. In this case the number of applicants was less than five times the number of vacancies,” said Justice Suman Shyam. The impugned select list dated 23.11.2022 was challenged by 21 petitioners who had participated in the interview but could not make it to the final list, on the ground that the selection procedure was not conducted as per the provisions of Rule-4B of the Assam Public Service Commission (Conduct of Business) Procedure, 2019. K. N. Choudhury, senior counsel, appearing for petitioners, argued that the authorities ought to have conducted a written test along with interview for preparation of select list as provided under Rule-4B. He further argued that since the number of applicants were more than three times the total number of vacancies, Rule 4A would not be applicable in this case. In an affidavit filed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary, it was explained that as per the provisions of Rule 6(c) of the Assam Animal Husbandry, Veterinary and Dairying Service Rules, 1988 read with Clause 4(A) of the Procedure of 2019, it was permissible for the Commission to prepare the select list only on the basis of interview without holding a written examination. P.K. Goswami, senior counsel appearing for private respondents, argued that the APSC had duly notified the procedure to be adopted - which is “interview only” by issuing the notification dated 02.11.2022.  He further submitted that the 2019 Procedure is very clear and the same confers discretionary power on the APSC to device the method of selection. "Since as per Rule 4, ‘interview’ is a permissible method for selection of candidates in case of direct recruitment, there is no infirmity in the select list dated 23.11.2022," Goswami argued. The court observed that by issuing the notification dated 02.11.2022 by APSC, it was notified that the selection process will be conducted on the basis of “interview”. The court further observed that the petitioners were not only aware of the method of selection but they had also appeared in the interview process without raising any protest. “A plain reading of Rule 4A of the Procedure of 2019 makes it clear that in case of direct recruitment the select list can be prepared only on the basis of interview. It is no doubt correct that Rule 4A speaks of short-listing the candidates by following the ratio indicated therein. However, it is also to be noted herein that the Rules clearly mention that the criteria for short-listing will be decided by the Commission,” it added. The court said that the inclusion of the expression “the criteria for short-listing will be decided by the Commission” makes it amply evident that if the posts were to be more than 100, it was open for the Commission to decide on the criteria of short-listing. But the fact of the matter is there was no short-listing in this matter, it added.  It further said that since all eligible candidates including writ petitioners were allowed to participate in the interview process, there has been no violation of Rule 4A in this case. “This Court finds that there is no ambiguity in Rules 4A and 4B of the Procedure of 2019. The Rule 4A, read in the context of Rule 6(c) of the Rules of 1988, which permits the Commission to make selection by holding test or interview, makes it amply clear that the procedure adopted by the APSC viz. holding interview only was not in violation of the applicable Rules,” it said. It vacated the interim stay order and dismissed the writ petition stating that it cannot be said that the procedure adopted by the APSC for preparation of the select-list by taking recourse under Rule 4A was impermissible in the eye of law.

The Bombay High Court has observed that a daughter-in-law cannot be directed to pay maintenance to her ailing mother-in-law, especially in the absence of any proof of the woman's income.

The Bombay High Court has observed that a daughter-in-law cannot be directed to pay maintenance to her ailing mother-in-law, especially in the absence of any proof of the woman's income.  "We have reservations about such direction to SS (daughter-in-law) to pay maintenance amount to the mother-in-law…Be that as it may, upon perusal of the original record, we do not find a single document showing the earnings of SS (daughter-in-law)," the HC observed.   It noted that Section 2(a) of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 that defines 'children,' includes son, daughter, grandson and grand-daughter, but does not refer to the daughter-in-law.  Observing thus, the bench of Justices SS Shinde and Revati Mohite Dere set aside the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens' Tribunal's order to the limited extent.   The court upheld direction to the son and daughter -in- law to vacate the plush Juhu bungalow based on the mother's complaint.   However, the bench directed the son to foot the entire amount of Rs 25,000 awarded by the tribunal and payable to his mother, each month. And in doing so the HC relieved the daughter-in-law of any monetary liability.  The court further directed the husband, a diamond merchant, to make arrangements for his wife's and children's stay outside the family home. "Son, being husband and guardian of two sons is legally obliged to provide them accommodation befitting his status, income and assets" the bench noted.   Facts of the case  The senior citizen couple aged 77 and 79 had approached the tribunal, which asked the son and daughter-in-law to vacate their bungalow and jointly pay the mother maintenance of Rs 25,000 a month. The daughter in law approached the HC assailing this 2019 order.   The father- in -law passed away during adjudication of proceedings.   The daughter-in-law contended the residential premises was ancestral property that the father-in-law had inherited. Moreover, her husband was paying the rent for the premises. Represented by advocate Yasmin Tavaria, the daughter-in-law argued that in 2019 the Family court had passed an order restraining the husband or anyone through him from entering in the matrimonial home.   She also claimed that the Senior Citizen Tribunal's order was passed without leading evidence.   Advocate Vivek Kantawala for the mother-in-law submitted that there was continuous mental and physical harassment meted out to his client and therefore the tribunal's order deserved to be upheld. He said the daughter-in- law had tried to hurt their religious sentiments by throwing eggs, knowing fully well that the family practiced Jainism.   He further said that the Family Court order was passed in the absence of the mother in law since she was not part of the proceedings.   At the outset the court observed that Section 3 makes it clear that the Senior Citizens Act shall have overriding effect on the provisions of any other Act, which are inconsistent with the provisions of the said Act. In effect this would mean that the Tribunal's directions would stand despite the family court's order.  The court upheld the tribunal's observations "family members viz., son and DIL should treat the mother-in-law with kindness, consideration and respect and that they should provide them basic necessities for a peaceful life. It is also observed that the kindness, consideration and respect cannot be bought with money." The court further said that it was couple's responsibility to pay attention to the daily needs of the mother-in-law and to try their best to meet those needs. "There is unrest and also there is a mental and physical harassment to the old aged parents."  The bench noted how on several occasion the mother came to court on a wheelchair.   Based on section 3 and section 23 of the Act which provides for protection of life and property of senior citizens, the tribunal correctly concluded, that the senior citizen request for exclusion of the son's name from the suit property can be granted, the HC observed while granting relief.

Unless live-streaming and archival of court proceedings sees the light of the day the absence of records of oral proceedings would continue to bedevil the system, the Supreme Court bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud remarked in the judgment disposing Election Commission of India's petition challenging oral remarks made by Madras High Court. The Court also noted that three years have elapsed since the decision in Swapnil Tripathi vs Supreme Court of India (2018) 10 SCC 639 [ which highlighted the importance of live streaming of judicial proceedings]. The bench, also comprising Justice MR Shah noted that cases before the courts are vital sources of public information about the activities of the legislature and the executive and serves an educational purpose as well. The court becomes a platform for citizens to know how the practical application of the law impacts upon their rights, the court noted. The Court further observed that several courts across the world, including the US Supreme Court, the UK Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal of the UK and the International Criminal Court enable public viewership of proceedings through live streaming or other suitable open access methodology. The Gujarat High Court also recently introduced live streaming of its proceedings, in a bid to enhance public participation in the dispensation of justice, it noted. In Swapnil Tripathi, three judge bench headed by then CJI Dipak Misra held that the Court proceedings shall be live-streamed in the larger public interest. Live streaming is for cases of constitutional and national importance, barring those involving juveniles, cases of sexual assault, matrimonial issues. The court also ordered that to give full effect to the process of live-streaming, advocates addressing the Bench, and judges addressing the Bar, must use microphones while addressing the court. The live streaming would be with prior consent of all parties concerned and if there is no unanimity, the court concerned will take the decision which shall not be open to appeal. The court will have copyright over the broadcasted content. There will also be reasonable time gap between the proceedings and streaming to ensure that anything which ought not be made public can be edited. ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Live-streaming as an extension of the principle of open courts will ensure that the interface between a court hearing with virtual reality will result in the dissemination of information in the widest possible sense, imparting transparency and accountability to the judicial process" the court had observed. In October last year, the Court dodged detailed queries raised under the Right to Information Act seeking reasons for the non-implementation of live-streaming of court proceedings by giving an evasive reply that the "matter is under the consideration of the Registry". Last Month, Justice DY Chandrachud said that the e-committee of the top Court is in the process of finalizing its rules for live streaming of court proceedings.    In the meanwhile, Gujarat High Court started live streaming of Court proceedings on YouTube from October 26, 2020.   Also From the judgment : 'Citizens Have Right To Know What Transpires In Judicial Proceedings' : Supreme Court Upholds Media's Freedom To Report Court Hearings No Question Of Expunging Judges' Oral Remarks Which Are Not Part Of Judicial Record : Supreme Court In ECI Case Real Time Reporting Of Court Hearing In Social Media Not A Cause Of Apprehension; A Virtual Extension Of 'Open Court' : Supreme Court

Every delay in conducting a disciplinary enquiry does not, ipso facto, lead to the enquiry being vitiated, the Supreme Court observed. The bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli observed that the prejudice caused by the delay must be demonstrated to have been caused and cannot be a matter of surmise. In this case, a departmental inquiry was initiated against a police officer who allegedly constituted, supervised and operated a gunda squad, after it was revealed that some members of such a squad arrested a person who later died in police custody. A magisterial enquiry was conducted into the custodial death and a report was submitted on 10 October 2014. On 8 June 2016, a departmental enquiry was convened against the officer and a charge-sheet was issued. Central Administrative Tribunal, on his application, quashed the chargesheet on the ground that there was a delay of nearly two years and that the charges were ambiguous;   In appeal, the court, referring to the charge-sheet, noted that it contains a detailed elaboration of the allegations against the officer. "It does not leave the recipient in a measure of doubt or ambiguity over the nature of the case he is required to answer in the disciplinary enquiry. The finding that the charge is vague is palpably in error.", the bench said. The court said that the Tribunal would have been justified in directing the expeditious conclusion of the enquiry, but instead, it proceeded to quash the enquiry in its entirety.  "This, in our view, was clearly impermissible. Every delay in conducting a disciplinary enquiry does not, ipso facto, lead to the enquiry being vitiated. Whether prejudice is caused to the officer who is being enquired into is a matter which has to be decided on the basis of the circumstances of each case. Prejudice must be demonstrated to have been caused and cannot be a matter of surmise. Apart from submitting that the first respondent was unable to proceed on deputation or to seek promotion, there is no basis on which it could be concluded that his right to defend himself stands prejudicially affected by a delay of two years in concluding the enquiry", the court said. Allowing the appeal, the court said that since chargesheet was issued to the officer while he was in service, the disciplinary enquiry can proceed to its logical conclusion. It should be concluded expeditiously, preferably by 31 July 2022, the bench said.         
The Madras High Court has directed the State government to continue its measures to monitor the amount of fees charged by way of movie tickets in cinema theatres .  Justice Anita Sumanth was dealing with three writ petitions which had been filed seeking action against theatre owners for charging more than the actual ticket rate fixed by the government for three movies- Kabali, Singam III and Bairavaa. The court also directed the State to take a decision on dealing with the excess charges already collected by the theatres.   The State shall continue with the measures for monitoring of ticket collection. A suitable decision also be taken on the fate of excess charges found to have been collected by the cinema theatres. As on date, the excess charges are retained by the theatre owners and the State only imposes a penalty for the violations detected.  The court noted that the petitioner had previously filed petitions seeking similar reliefs for other movies. At that time, the first bench had noted that the violations had to be looked into by the Commercial Tax Department and the Licensing Authority. The court had thus directed the setting up of a Special Tea, to monitor the aspects of violations and inform the public at large about the methodology for giving complaints telephonically.    The petitioner had alleged that even after the above order, the respondent shad failed to take note of the menace. The petitioner submitted that even though the Government had fixed the minimum and maximum price of tickets, the theatre owners still continued to sell tickets at a rate higher than the rate fixed.  At the time of admission, the Police Commissioner submitted that pursuant to the earlier orders of the court, suitable actions have been taken by constituting various committees to monitor the complaints against the theatre owners who were charging excess rates. The committees have been set up across the state of Tamil Nadu and the manner of providing complaints has also been prescribed under various circulars.    The Advocate General had also informed the court that vide another government order, the Home (Cinema) Department had made amendments with respect to fixing rates of tickets in A/C theatres and Non A/C theatres in Municipal Corporation, municipalities, town panchayats, village panchayats fixing both minimum and maximum ticket charges. Therefore, the theatre owners could not charge above this rate.   The court also looked into the Status Report filed by the State with respect to the actions taken by them with respect to theatres which were found to be charging rates more than the rate fixed by the government. Being satisfied with the steps taken, the court directed the state to continue with the measures for monitoring the ticket collection.  Case Title: G Devarajan v. The Chief Secretary and others

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench recently directed the Union of India to release the amount of compensation awarded to Petitioners, senior citizens, for their Bungalow that was resumed by the Ministry of Defence for their own purposes.  The Court observed that the Union of India was dragging its feet in paying the amount to the Petitioners despite its specific directions to the executing court to dispose of the execution proceeding within 4 months.  Justice Subodh Abhyankar was dealing with a writ petition filed by the Petitioners seeking directions of the Court to the Central Government to comply with the award passed by the Competent Arbitration Committee for resuming their property by the Ministry of Defence for their own purposes, and compensate them accordingly.  The case of the Petitioners was that they were awarded compensation by the Arbitration Committee for their bungalow that was resumed by the Ministry of Defence but the same was not being executed despite the award being granted 10 years back. They asserted that despite their age, they were running pillar to post to get their compensation but to no anvil. The Petitioners further submitted that they had earlier filed a writ petition before the Court wherein the Court had directed the executing court to decide the pending execution case of the arbitration award within 4 months but the same was not complied with.  The Centre submitted that the award passed by the Arbitration Committee was not in terms of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and that the award was in the form of recommendation to the Ministry of Defence, which was rejected vide order passed by the authority concerned, 10 years later. They further argued that since the award was recommendatory in nature, the same could not be executed by the trial court.  Considering the submissions of parties and documents on record, the Court opined that although the award used the term Anushansa i.e. recommendation, nothing was brought on record by the UoI that would state that the said award/recommendation was not binding in nature.  The Court took strong exception to the order passed by the Ministry of Defence, whereby it rejected the award given by the Arbitration Committee after 10 years of its passing-  On perusal of the aforesaid order it is apparent that on earlier occasion also the award passed by the Arbitration Committee has been directed to be complied with by this court. In such facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the considered opinion that merely if the award dated 30/11/2011 has been rejected or set aside by the respondents, on 08/03/2022 i.e., after 10 years, and taking note of the order dated 02/03/2020 passed by this Court in WP No.4117/2020, this Court has no hesitation to come to a conclusion that the respondents have not only failed in their duties to redress the grievance of senior citizens 74 years and 66 years old respectively, but have also failed to perform their duties with due diligence.  The Court further observed that the Centre neither challenged the award or the proceedings before the executing court and that it was avoiding the implementation of award despite clear directions of the Court-  It is also found the award dated 30/11/2011, passed by the Arbitration Committee has not been challenged by them in any court of law and even the execution proceedings have never been challenged on the ground that there is no award under the Arbitration Act and it was only a recommendation. What this court sees is only Tareekh pe Tareekh sought by the UOI to satisfy the award, especially when the case is pending since 01/04/2009 and it was specifically directed by this court vide order dated 02.03.2020 in W.P.No.4117/2020, to dispose of the proceedings within 4 months' time…  The Court noted that even the executing court did not conclude the proceedings within 4 months, even after two years from the date of the Court's order directing it to do so, which was demonstrative of its failure 'to exercise the powers vested in it by law despite being armed with the aforesaid order' of the Court, which also had the effect of demeaning its own authority.  With regard to the order passed by the Ministry of Defence, the Court held that the same was only an eye wash which was passed to get out of the unpleasant situation of paying the compensation to the Petitioner-  So far as the order dated 08/03/2022 passed by the respondents rejecting the award passed by the Arbitration Committee on 30/11/2011 is concerned, in the considered opinion of this court it is only an eye wash and appears to have been passed only with a view to wriggle out of this unpleasant situation and is of no help to the respondent at this juncture of the lis. It is also beyond the faculties of this court as to why, after acquiring the property of a citizen in the year 2009, a democratic Government would shy away from making the payment and would not part with a single penny even in the year 2022.  With the aforesaid observations, the Court directed the Central Government to release the amount of compensation awarded to the Petitioners in terms of the award within a period of 6 months.

In a significant order, the Allahabad High Court has asked the UP Govt as to what is the requirement to appoint so many Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing Counsels at Allahabad High Court (both Benches) to defend the State when already more than 400 State lawyers are impaneled by it. The Bench of Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal also took expectation to the practice of outsourcing the lawyers on behalf of the State and its various authorities and corporations wherein a big amount of taxpayers' money is being used. Essentially, the Court was dealing with a contempt petition in a land acquisition matter. When the court reserved its Judgment, the Additional Advocate General M. C. Chaturvedi made a request that his appearance be recorded not only for the State of U.P. but also for the Ghaziabad Development Authority. Expressing its displeasure over his request, the Court pointed toward a routine feature in its order that it has come across cases wherein the Additional Advocate General and the Chief Standing Counsel appointed by the State Government also hold briefs of various development authorities and the corporations. Against this backdrop, noting that the Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing Counsel take more interest in appearing in the matters of development authorities and corporations, the Court observed thus: "There are huge number of cases where the assistance from the State side is needed but the assistance is not available to the Court. If the Additional Advocate Generals and Chief Standing Counsel have sufficient time to represent the development authorities and corporations, then there is no need for the State to have such large panels of lawyers and incur huge financial liability. After all it is the tax payers money which is being used in the payment of State counsel. This Court also wants to bring to the notice of the Government that there is lot of outsourcing of the lawyers on behalf of State and its various authorities and corporations and a big amount of tax payers money is being used." The court further added that in case, any such bills have been raised by any Additional Advocate General or Chief Standing Counsel from the State and development authority or corporation of the State in one case, the said amount should be recovered from him as it is taxpayers money which cannot be misused. Importantly, the Court also observed that it is expected from the State to have a balanced and competent panel of lawyers without any need for assistance from outsiders.  In this regard, the Court stressed that the appearance of lawyers not from the panel of the State shows that the lawyers impaneled with the State don't have much competence to defend the State and its authorities and corporations. Further, the Court directed the Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. to apprise the working of the State Law Department in Allahabad High Court and place the matter/order before the Cabinet for taking appropriate action and make a draft plan as to how the working is to be improved regarding the State counsel in the Allahabad High Court as well as its Lucknow Bench. "Thereafter, the Cabinet may take decision, as required, in the best interest of the State. The Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. shall intimate the progress made in the aforesaid matter to the Registrar General of this Court within two months," the Court remarked as it parted with the order.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday clarified that its directions to create special courts for trial of criminal cases against sitting and former MPs/MLAs cannot be construed to mean that cases triable by Magistrates as per the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure are to be transferred to the Sessions Court.Accordingly, a bench comprising the Chief Justice of India NV Ramana,...  The Supreme Court on Wednesday clarified that its directions to create special courts for trial of criminal cases against sitting and former MPs/MLAs cannot be construed to mean that cases triable by Magistrates as per the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure are to be transferred to the Sessions Court. Accordingly, a bench comprising the Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant interfered with a notification dated 16.08.2019 issued by the Allahabad High Court to transfer the cases pending against legislators from Magistrates to the Special MP/MLA Courts created at the Sessions Courts level. The bench clarified that its directions were not meant to supplant the jurisdictional provisions contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or any other special enactments regarding the trial of offences. "The directions of this Court mandate the assigning and allocation of criminal cases involving former and sitting legislators to Sessions Courts or, as the case may be, Magisterial Courts. This has to be in accordance with the governing provisions of the law as applicable", the Court said in the order. "Consequently, where a case is triable by a Magistrate under the Penal Code, the case would have to be assigned/allocated to a court of a Magistrate vested with jurisdiction and the Order of this Court dated 4 December 2018 cannot be construed as a direction requiring the trial of the case by a Sessions Court", the Court added. The Court emphasized that its Order dated 4.12.2018 makes it abundantly clear that instead of designating one Sessions Court and one Magisterial Court in each District, the High Courts were requested to assign and allocate criminal cases involving former and sitting legislatures to as many Sessions Courts and Magisterial Courts as each High Court would consider appropriate fit and expedient. The bench passed the direction in applications filed by Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan, who prayed that the cheating cases filed against him be tried before the Magistrate Courts as per the CrPC, instead of being transferred to the Sessions Court as per the notification issued by the Allahabad High Court. The bench noted that the in the State of Uttar Pradesh, no Magisterial Courts have been designated as Special Courts for the trial of cases triable by Magistrates in terms of the directions of this Court dated 4 December 2018. "The Notification issued by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad on 16 August 2019 is based on an evident misconstruction of the directions contained in the order of this Court," the Supreme Court said. Therefore, the Court ordered the Allahabad High Court to allocate criminal cases involving former and sitting legislatures to as many sessions courts and magisterial courts as required. "We further direct that cases triable by Magistrates which are pending before the Sessions Court in view of the Circular dated 16 August 2019 shall stand transferred to the Court of competent jurisdiction. However, the entire record and proceedings shall be transferred to the Court of the designated Magistrate and the proceedings shall commence from the stage which has been reached prior to the transfer of the proceedings, as a consequence of which the trial shall not have to commence afresh,"  the Court further ordered. Earlier, Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Azam Khan, had argued that the transferring of cases triable by Magistrates to the Sessions Court was in violation of the procedure established by law. He highlighted the following points : A direction passed by the Supreme Court under Article 142 cannot be applied in violation of the statutory jurisdiction conferred by the CrPC.The transfer of case to Magistrate results in losing of right to appeal before the Sessions Court as provided under Section 374 CrPC.          This results in discrimination and arbitrariness as an MP from another state is tried before a Magistrate, while an MP from UP is tried for the same offence before the Sessions Court.Such a trial will not be in accordance with "procedure established by law" as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution. Sibal relied on the precedents State of West Bengal v Anwar Ali Sarkar 1952 SCR 284, A.R. Antulay vs R.S. Nayak to buttress his arguments. Sibal said that more than the losing of the right to appeal, his emphasis was on the violation of right to equality. There is no dispute that Special Courts can be created for a class of offences or offender, but the jurisdiction must be as conferred by the statute, Sibal argued.            Amicus justifies transfer of cases to Sessions Court. Amicus Curiae Vijay Hansaria has submitted a report stating that it was not illegal to allow Special Courts at Sessions Level to handle cases triable by Magistrates. He pointed out that in 2G scam cases and coal block cases, the Supreme Court had transferred the cases to Special Courts. The Amicus argued that the right to appeal was not lost, as appeal lies to the High Court from the Sessions Court.            Additional Solicitor General SV Raju  argued that Magistrate doesn't have exclusive jurisdiction as per the code. To buttress this argument, the ASG cited Section 323 CrPC, as per which ca Magistrate himself can transfer a case to sessions court. The ASG also referred to Section 228 CrPC in this regard.         
The Allahabad High Court last week granted anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping his daughter-in-law as the Court noted that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with some other person in our Indian culture."...considering that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with... The Allahabad High Court last week granted anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping his daughter-in-law as the Court noted that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with some other person in our Indian culture. "...considering that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with some other person in our Indian culture, considering that the accusation has been made falsely with the object of injuring or humiliating his reputation in the society," the bench of Justice Ajit Singh observed as it extended the benefit of anticipatory bail to accused-Babu Khan (father-in-law of the victim). Essentially, the Court was dealing with an anticipatory bail application filed on behalf of the applicant (Babu Khan) in connection with a case registered against him under sections 376, 511, 504 and 506 I.P.C. The FIR in the case was lodged by the victim (daughter-in-law of the accused) against Khan (father-in-law) and other co-accused Mohammad Haroon. It was alleged by the victim that her father-in-law along with the co-accused came to the house of the victim's brother and asked if her brother is there in the house. Further, when the victim said that her brother is not at home, then the father-in-law/accused started abusing her and when the victim tried to stop him, then she was pushed on the bed by him, then both the accused tried to rape her. The Counsel for the applicant (Khan) contended that similarly placed other co-accused Mohammad Haroon had been granted anticipatory bail by the High Court and hence, he is also entitled to anticipatory bail on the ground of parity. Against this backdrop, the Court granted him pre-arrest bail by observing thus: "Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusations and the antecedents of the applicant, considering the gravity of the offence, considering that it is quite unnatural that a father-in-law shall commit rape of his own daughter-in-law along with some other person in our Indian culture, considering that the accusation has been made falsely with the object of injuring or humiliating his reputation in the society., considering the Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Sushila Aggarwal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)...and in the case of Satendra Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation..." He was directed to be released on anticipatory bail on his furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount of Rs. 25,000/- to the satisfaction of the Station House Officer concerned.

The Bombay High Court recently reiterated that unlike criminal proceedings, in civil proceedings, a court can rely on statements given to the police under section 162 of CrPC. Therefore, it relied on witness statements made before CID in a criminal investigation to decide a property dispute involving the royal family of Kuwait. "If the statement made before a police officer, in the course of an investigation under chapter XII is sought to be used in any proceeding other than an enquiry or trial or even at an enquiry or trial but in respect of an offence other than which was under investigation at the time when such statement was made, the bar of Section 162 would not be attracted", the court stated. Justice BP Colabawala, while dealing with a notice of motion in the civil suit, extended the interim relief granted to the eldest daughter of late Sheikh Saad, former Emir of the Kuwait and restrained the defendants from creating any third-party rights in the disputed premises in a building owned by the royal family. The plaintiff, Sheikhah Fadiah Saad has filed a suit alleging that the defendants Sanjay Punamiya, Amish Shaikh, and Mahesh Soni have taken illegal possession of certain flats and the parking garage (suit premises) of the building named Al-Sabah Court at Marine drive, Mumbai. According to the plaint, Counsel General of Kuwait Faisal Essa was authorised by Sheikh Saad to care of the building. After Sheikh Saad's demise, his legal heirs granted the authority to Faisal Essa to take care of the properties of the royal family. The plaint states that Faisal Essa was in the possession of the suit premises till he went back to Kuwait on May 06, 2013. It is the plaintiff's allegation that the defendants took illegal possession of the suit premises after Faisal Essa left for Kuwait. They found blank receipt books, seals, signature stamps etc. and fabricated tenancy agreements and rent receipts between the three defendants and Essa for the suit premises. The plaintiff filed the present notice of motion in the suit seeking appointment of a court receiver and a declaration that the aforementioned tenancy agreements are forged and do not bind her. She also sought directions to the defendants to pay her mesne profits of Rs 35 lakhs per month. The defendants relied on CID's investigation of this issue after Faisal Essa registered a criminal complaint against Punamiya in 2014. CID had investigated the case and based on witness statements, handwriting expert reports etc. concluded that the defendants had not forged the tenancy agreements. While the plaint claims that that Faisal Essa was in possession of the suit premises till May 2013, various witnesses made statements before the CID under section 162 Cr.P.C. that Punamiya was in possession of part of the disputed premises since October 2012. Advocate Haresh Jagtiani for the plaintiff objected to the court relying on these statements. Usage of statements made to the police officer in the course of an investigation is barred under section 162 and such statements cannot be relied upon in the present proceedings, he contended. Relying on the Apex Court judgment in Khatri v. State of Bihar the court rejected Jagtiani's interpretation of section 162 of the Cr.P.C. It noted that section 162 specifically bars usage of statements made before the police officer during trial or inquiry with respect to the offence that was being investigated. However, the present case is a civil proceeding. The court noted that this section has been enacted to protect the accused on the assumption that the statements before the police are not made under circumstances that inspire confidence. "This protection, and which is given to the accused, can certainly not bar the Court from looking at the statements made before the police officer in civil proceedings so long as it is relevant under Indian Evidence Act." The court noted that the plaintiff has nowhere claimed that Faisal Essa did not have the authority to execute the said tenancy agreements. Therefore, the issue to be considered was whether the tenancy agreements were prima facie forged and fabricated in order to appoint a court receiver, the court said. The defendants in their respective reply affidavits had set out the circumstances in which the tenancies were created. The court noted that the plaintiff or Faisal Essa has not filed any rejoinder contesting the case of the defendants. Further, their tenancy agreements have been notarized by the same person who also notarized 14 of the affidavits filed by the other tenants of the building which have been relied on by the plaintiff, the court observed. The defendants had filed suits before the Small Causes Court between January and April, 2013 and attached rent receipts for the suit premises. The court noted that the plaintiff did not explain how they had rent receipts in January and April 2013 if they allegedly forged it after Faisal Essa left for Kuwait in May 2013. The court concluded that the plaintiff could not prima facie establish that Faisal Essa was in possession of the suit premises till May 2013 and the tenancy agreements between Faisal Essa and the defendants are forged and fabricated. The question of appointing a court receiver will arise only when the court comes to the conclusion that prima facie the plaintiff has an excellent chance of succeeding in the suit, said the court. Therefore, there is no question of appointing a court receiver for the suit premises or directing defendants to pay any mistake profit to the plaintiff, the court held. Case no. – Notice of Motion No. 313 of 2014 in Suit No. 
The Calcutta High Court has recently upheld the conviction of a husband for the commission of the offence of dowry death under Section 304B of the IPC after opining that it is impossible for witnesses such as neighbours to state whether the victim housewife was tortured within the four corners of the matrimonial home or not. A Bench comprising Justice Bivas Pattanayak and Justice Joymalya Bagchi noted from the evidence on record that marks of injury had been found on the body off the deceased and that in addition to the ligature mark, investigating officers had found swelling on the back of the head and bruise marks on the left palm of the deceased. Acknowledging that it is very unlikely that the deceased would confide in witnesses such as neighbours about the torture that was meted out to her, the Court underscored,  "These injuries show victim housewife had been subjected to physical assault immediately prior to her death probabilising the saga of torture as narrated by her relations. When a housewife is tortured within four corners of the matrimonial home, persons to whom she would ordinarily confide are her parents and close relations. It is highly unlikely she would narrate her misfortune to outsiders including neighbours. Analysing the evidence on record from this perspective, I am of the opinion evidence of parents and other relations of the victim girl with regard to torture meted out to her over further demand of money are wholly reliable. Evidence of the defence witnesses appear to be tutored. None of the witnesses were privy to the household affairs of the appellants." Thus, the Court opined that the defence witnesses are untrustworthy and that it is impossible for them to state whether victim housewife was tortured within the four corners of the matrimonial home or not. It was further noted that the post-mortem doctors had found ligature mark the neck of the victim and had opined death was due to asphyxia arising out of ante mortem hanging. It was also noted that the concerned doctor had found clotted blood and product of conception (gestational sac) in the uterus. "From these findings it appears that the victim housewife who was pregnant had been subjected to torture over demands of dowry and was brutally assaulted at the matrimonial home prior to her death. Unable to bear such torture, she committed suicide", the Court opined.  Accordingly, the Court rejected the 'absurd' plea that the victim had committed suicide as she was unhappy with the financial status of her husband and further observed that consistent evidence on record shows that she had been physically and mentally tortured at the matrimonial home over further demands of dowry. Upholding the order of conviction against the husband, the Court observed,   "These circumstances wholly rule out the fanciful plea of suicide by an over-emotional lady who was unhappy with her unsuccessful husband." The Court however acquitted the mother-in-law and the father-in-law after observing that no specific overt act has been attributed either to the father in law or mother in-law regarding torture on the victim housewife over further demands of dowry.

The Supreme Court has observed that once the prosecution is able to establish that a woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty with demand for dowry have caused dowry death u/s 304B of the Indian Penal Code.The bench of Chief... The Supreme Court has observed that once the prosecution is able to establish that a woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty with demand for dowry have caused dowry death u/s 304B of the Indian Penal Code. The bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli was considering the criminal appeals filed by the accused persons(deceased's husband and mother in law) assailing Jharkhand High Court's judgement dated May 1, 2007 ("impugned judgement"). In the impugned judgement, the High Court had upheld the judgment of conviction dated 20th September 1999 u/s 304B and 201 r/w Section 34 IPC passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Giridih, sentencing them and Nema Mahto (deceased's father in law) to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years and three years respectively on each count with both the sentences running concurrently.  While directing the deceased's husband to surrender in Ram Sahay Mahto v. State Of Bihar Now State Of Jharkhand & Ors. and allowing the mother in law's appeal in Parvati Devi V. The State Of Bihar Now State Of Jharkhand & Ors, the bench observed that, "Section 304B IPC read in conjunction with Section 113B of the Evidence Act leaves no manner of doubt that once the prosecution has been able to demonstrate that a woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry, soon before her death, the Court shall proceed on a presumption that the persons who have subjected her to cruelty or harassment in connection with the demand for dowry, have caused a dowry death within the meaning of Section 304B IPC. The said presumption is, however, rebuttable and can be dispelled on the accused being able to demonstrate through cogent evidence that all the ingredients of Section 304B IPC have not been satisfied." Factual Background  As per the prosecution's case, the informant (Bodhi Mahto) got his daughter (Fulwa Devi) married to Ram Sahay Mahto (appellant 1) in 1997 and within few months of marriage, Ram Sahay's mother (Parvati Devi/Appellant 3) and his father Nema Mahto started to harass her daughter by raising a demand for the sum of Rs 20,000 in case and a motorcycle. When her daughter expressed her parent's inability to satisfy their demands, she was brutally assaulted and threatened that her husband would be married off to another girl. Since Bodhi Mahto's daughter went missing from her matrimonial home, she lodged a complaint on August 13, 1997 u/s 304/201/34 IPC. On completion of the investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against all the three accused for the aforesaid offences along with Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Five days after lodging the FIR, a skeleton was recovered from the banks of river Barakar, at a distance of about one kilometer short of Village Sirmadih which was assumed to be that of Fulwa Devi. Charges were thereafter framed against the three accused(s) under Sections 304B/34, 201/34 IPC. The trial court on September 20, 1999 convicted the accused(s) u/s 304B and 201 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them and Nema Mahto (deceased's father in law) to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years and three years respectively on each count with both the sentences running concurrently. Aggrieved, the accused(s) approached the High Court. The Jharkhand High Court on May 1, 2007 upheld the Trial Court's judgement of conviction. The High Court agreed with the Trial Court's view that accused had miserably failed to explain the circumstances under which the deceased had vanished from her matrimonial home and had outrightly rejected the accused's defence that she was not residing with her husband and in-laws; rather, she was living with her brother-in- law. The Court had also agreed with the Trial Court turning down the plea taken by the accused that the dead body that was recovered from the banks of river Bara. Another plea taken by the accused that the dead body recovered from the banks of river Barakar was unidentifiable, was also turned down, having regard to the fact that the accused failed to explain the circumstance in which the deceased went missing from her matrimonial home and became traceless. The conduct of the accused of failing to inform the family members or the police about the deceased going missing from her matrimonial home and failure on their part to make any effort to search her out, were also held against them. In fact, PW-4, brother of the deceased had categorically deposed that when he had gone to her matrimonial home, he found it to be locked and all the accused were absconding just after the occurrence which was a critical circumstance that was held against them.  Aggrieved the appellants approached the Top Court. Supreme Court's Analysis  To examine the prosecution's case, the bench in the judgement authored by Justice Hima Kohli first referred to Section 304B IPC. In this regards, the bench laid down the following prerequisites to be followed for convicting the accused for offence punishable u/s 304B IPC:  (i) that the death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or occurred otherwise than under normal circumstance; (ii) that such a death must have occurred within a period of seven years of her marriage; (iii) that the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment at the hands of her husband, soon before her death; and (iv) that such cruelty or harassment must have been for or related to any demand for dowry. Referring to section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and explanation appended to Section 304B IPC, the bench said,  "In the instant case, despite the shoddy investigation conducted by the prosecution, we are of the view that the circumstances set out in Section 304B of the IPC have been established in the light of the fact that the deceased, Fulwa Devi had gone missing from her matrimonial home within a few months of her marriage and immediately after demands of dowry were made on her and that her death had occurred under abnormal circumstances, such a death would have to be characterized as a "dowry death". With regards to the deceased's husband, the bench said that there was sufficient evidence brought on record to inculpate him and that putting the circumstances together unerringly pointed out to his guilt in extinguishing the life of his wife within a few months of the marriage on her failing to satisfy the demands of dowry. Refusing to interfere with the High Court's judgement, the bench said, "In our view, the impugned judgment and order of sentence imposed on A-1 does not deserve interference and is maintained. Criminal Appeal No. 575 of 2012 filed by A-1 is accordingly dismissed. The said appellant who is presently on bail, is directed to surrender before the Trial Court/Superintendent of Jail within four weeks to undergo the remaining period of his sentence." For the criminal appeal preferred by the deceased's mother in law, the bench opined that only certain omnibus allegations were made against her with respect to dowry demands. Allowing her appeal, the bench remarked, "In fact, in the only direct evidence before the Court, PW-3 (informant and father of the victim) mentions that A-2 threatened to harm the deceased. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that it is necessary to interfere with the findings of the Courts below convicting A-3 (appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 574 of 2012) for the offence under Sections 304B and 201 read with Section 34, IPC. The said appeal filed by A-3 is accordingly allowed. She is directed to be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case." Case Title: Parvati Devi V.

A single judge bench of Justice Suresh Kait of the Delhi High Court today rejected the bail application of a Delhi riots-accused, Shahrukh Pathan Khan, who faces charges of firing shots at a Head Constable of the Delhi Police in Jaffarabad in the Delhi Riots 2020 violence. Placing reliance upon the video footages produced by the police as evidence, the court said, "The video clipping and pictures played before this Court have shaken the conscience of this Court how petitioner could take law and order in his hands." It further said that regardless of his intention to kill the complainant or any person present in the public with his open air pistol shots, it was "hard to believe that he had no knowledge that his act may harm anyone present at the spot." Referring to the facts of the case and Pathan's defence, the bench noted that, "...it is not the case of petitioner that he was not involved in the alleged incident." The Karkardooma Court (Delhi) in November had refused to grant interim bail to Pathan, whose videos showing him "firing shots" at a policeman, during the February 2020 Delhi Riots had gone viral on the social media/internet. Justice Kait held that, "...the learned trial court has rightly held that the petitioner is alleged to have participated in riots and his picture speaks a volume about his involvement." The court also said that the worthiness of the complainant's statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. and the Pathan's claim that he "had not aimed (the) pistol to shoot at the complainant, shall be tested at trial." Earlier, the Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat had rejected the interim bail plea of Pathan. Pathan was caught on Feb 24 last year, brandishing a pistol with the temerity of firing and pointing it at police personnel Head Constable Deepak Dahiya, who was deputed on that day for law and order arrangements near Jaffarabad Metro Station. The instant case against Pathan was registered under Sections 147, 148, 149, 216, 186, 307, 353 & 34 IPC read with Section 25 & 27 Arms Act. After the said incident near Jaffarabad Metro Station, he had absconded, however, he was arrested by the team of Delhi Police Crime Branch on Mar 3, 2020 from the Shamli Bus Stand, Uttar Pradesh on the basis of secret information.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday expressed concern over the enormous number of protection petitions being filed before it by runaway and inter-faith couples.  A Single Bench of Justice Avneesh Jhingan while stating that the genuine cases of threat are often overlooked amid a pile of cases that are filed on a daily basis, suggested several steps to make the executive responsible for offering protection to the lives of such couples, so that burden on Courts is reduced.  The Judge, inter alia, suggested:  Safe houses should be made available in each district of Punjab and Haryana, as well as in Union Territory, Chandigarh. A website or an on-line module should be provided for such like couples to raise their grievances without being physically present. Providing of 24x7 help desk at Tehsil level for filing of such representations by aggrieved persons or through someone. An existing cell in Police department can be deputed or a new cell can be created which can deal with the representation in a time-bound manner, in any case not beyond 48 hours. It can also be ensured by authorities that in case a request is made by the couples during the period of consideration of the representation, they be provided shelter in safe houseThe Legal Services Authorities can set up 24x7 help desk for such couples with telephone service and internet connectivity at the local level.  As the State Counsels gave positive responses to the above suggestions, the Court directed the Advocate Generals of both the States, Senior Standing Counsel for Union Territory, Chandigarh and Member Secretaries of the Legal Services Authorities to make a joint effort for dealing with the issue mentioned above.  It clarified,  "The entire endeavour of the exercise is that some sort of workable mechanism is put in motion to ensure the protection of life and personal liberty as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Further that only in exceptional cases, the couples have to take trouble to approach this Court alleging infringement of the rights."  The observation was made while hearing a criminal writ petition filed by a runaway couple, apprehending that they may be eliminated by their families.  Findings  At the outset, the Single Bench observed that a large number of such petitions are being filed by the couples who performed marriage against the wishes of their parents and relatives.  "Over the period it is experienced that number of such petitions are filed as a matter of routine. It is evident from most of these petitions that the day the marriage is performed, a representation is made and in some cases even the writ petition is drafted/filed on the same very day. In most of the cases, there is even no proof of submission of the representation," the Bench noted.  It further observed that the petitions of such nature are either disposed of, without commenting on the validity of the marriage and directing the official respondents to consider the representation or notice of motion is issued to the official respondents.   "In latter case by the next date, the police officials record the statements of the petitioners. By and large the statement is that there is no threat perception existing. The net result is that the petitions involving real serious and eminent threat get mixed up in number of petitions filed in routine," it added while contemplating a proper mechanism to deal with such cases.  At this juncture, the Court also expressed displeasure at the fact that the directions issued by the High Court to all the District & Sessions Judges in the two States (in Asha & Anr. v. State of Haryana & Ors., vide order dated March 31, 2010) for granting interim protection to such couples, are not being complied with.

The High Court of Delhi has held that the Court cannot grant a relief which is final in nature in an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act. The bench of Justice Chandra Dhari Singh held that relief contemplated under Section 9 of the Act is only interim in nature I.e., ‘in the intervening time’ or ‘provisional’ and it has to be in aid of the enforcement of the... The High Court of Delhi has held that the Court cannot grant a relief which is final in nature in an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act.  The bench of Justice Chandra Dhari Singh held that relief contemplated under Section 9 of the Act is only interim in nature I.e., ‘in the intervening time’ or ‘provisional’ and it has to be in aid of the enforcement of the award and subject to the final relief given in the award. The Court refused to injunct the respondent from withholding the payment on account of alleged delay as the Court observed that the relief claimed by the petitioner was final in nature as it was neither subject to any award or in aid of any enforcement.   The Court further reiterated that the court cannot either enforce an award, in the garb of interim relief, under Section 9 of the Act or grant an interim relief which is beyond the reliefs granted under the award.   Facts  The parties entered into a concession agreement dated 31.03.2006. A dispute arose between the parties related to the terms of the agreement regarding the renewal of the work every five years. Accordingly, the dispute was referred to arbitration and an award dated 14.01.2020 was passed wherein the relief claimed by the petitioner was partially allowed. The award has been put to challenge by both the parties and is pending consideration before the Court.   Thereafter, the petitioner raised an invoice for the payment of 22nd Annuity. Another dispute arose between the parties when the respondent deducted an amount from the invoice on the ground of delay in completing the 2nd renewal work. Aggrieved with the deductions made, the petitioner filed the application under Section 9 of the Act praying for refund of the amount deducted.   Contention of the Parties  The petitioner sought refund on the following grounds:  The deductions made by the respondent is against the award dated 14.01.2020. The petitioner cannot be faulted for the delay in the completion of the 2nd renewal work as the Coordinate bench of the High Court, on an interlocutory application moved in the challenge petition, had stayed the operation of the direction of the arbitral tribunal directing the petitioner to carry out the renewal work. Prior to that, the Arbitral tribunal had itself stayed the operation of the second renewal work, therefore, the operation of the 2nd renewal work was stalled, firstly, at the directions of the tribunal and then at the directions of the Court, thus, no cause of action has arisen for the respondent to levy damages on the petitioner for the alleged delay. Moreover, there is no clause in the agreement to permit the respondent to make deductions from the annuity payments, also the agreement provides that notwithstanding any dispute between the parties, the annuity payments are to be released in full.   The respondent opposed the petition on the following grounds:  The petitioner is claiming a final relief in the form of release of the payment withheld by the respondent. The relief is final in nature as it is not subject to any prospective arbitration nor in aid of enforcement of the award. The arbitral tribunal has directed the petitioner to complete the 2nd renewal work and that finding of the arbitral tribunal has not yet been set aside, therefore, the award remains in operation, thus, the respondent can impose damages on the petitioner for any delay. The interim order of the tribunal stands vacated in view of the final award.   Analysis by the Court  Firstly, the Court dealt with the preliminary objection regarding the nature of relief. The Court referred to Section 9 of the Act and several judgments by the Courts to decide the nature of relief that can be claimed and granted by the Court exercising powers under Section 9 of the Act.   The Court held that Section 9 provides for interim relief and the word interim here means ‘in the interim period’ or ‘provisional’. The Court held that Section 9 is to be understood by ‘Literal Rule of Interpretation’, thus, the relief can only be interim in nature and not a final relief.   The Court also observed that the Court cannot grant an interim relief that has the effect of rendering the final relief as infructuous, thus, the interim relief must be made subject to the final relief. Also, when the award is passed but before it is enforceable under Section 39 of the Act, the scope of interim relief must be limited to the final relief granted in the award.  The Court observed that the relief that the petitioner is claiming is in the nature of final relief as it is not claiming refund of the amount so withheld subject to the proceedings under Section 34 or the enforcement of the award but in the nature of a permanent order. It observed as under:  “Although the petitioner is seeking an order on the prayers sought under Section 9(1) of the Arbitration Act, however, is attempting to obtain a permanent relief of release of amount of Rs. 12,56,72,430/- in its favour which it alleges has been wrongfully, illegally, and arbitrarily deducted. It is not the case of the petitioner that the amount to be released in its favour is merely a provisional payment necessary for sustenance or immediate operations etc., required only till the disposal of proceedings or enforcement of Award, which shall be returned or reimbursed to the respondent after the proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act are concluded. Rather, the petitioner is seeking a relief in the nature of a permanent order by praying for directions to the respondent to remit the amount deducted by it once and for all.”  Accordingly, the Court dismissed the petition.   Case Title: GMR Pochanpalli Expressways Limited v.

The Delhi High Court has observed that a newspaper or an agency engaged in the dissemination of news cannot be viewed as performing a public function. Justice Yashwant Varma dismissed a writ petition filed by one Prakash Singh laying allegations of racial discrimination and harassment against Agence France-Presse, a French private international news agency, against him. The Court dismissed the plea as not being maintainable.  Advocate Raghav Awasthi appearing for the petitioner drew the attention of the Court to the fact that Agence France-Presse was constituted by an Act of Parliament of France.  It was argued that its essential functions would indicate that it was an autonomous civil entity which had been constituted for the purpose to seek out, in France as well as abroad, the elements of a complete and objective information service and also to place that information at the disposal of users in exchange for payment. He also apprised the Court about the Charter of the said agency which states that the activities of Agence France-Presse must comply with some fundamental obligations.  The said obligations include that the agency may under no circumstances take account of influences or considerations liable to compromise the exactitude or the objectivity of the information it provides and that it may under no circumstances fall under the control, either de facto or de jure, of any ideological, political or economic grouping.  It was thus submitted that the respondent press agency clearly performed a public function and since allegations of racial discrimination had been levelled, the writ petition would clearly lie.  Expressing disagreement with the said submission, the Court observed thus:  "While it may be true that the second respondent had been constituted by an Act by the Parliament of France, it becomes relevant to note that the newspaper or an agency engaged in the dissemination of news cannot be viewed as performing a public function." "Regard must be had to the fact that the expression "public function" and "public duty" have been understood to be those which are akin to functions performed by the State in its sovereign capacity. The Court further notes that the contract of service between the petitioner and the second respondent is not imbued with any statutory flavour." With the said observations, the Court dismissed the plea.  Case Title: PRAKASH SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA & ANR.    
"The Police authorities are expected to be quite sensitive in such matters, because, what is at stake is the freedom of speech and expression."

"The Police authorities are expected to be quite sensitive in such matters, because, what is at stake is the freedom of speech and expression." Observed the Bombay High Court, bench at Goa, while quashing an FIR registered by the Goa Police under sec. 295A of the Indian Penal Code against members of "Dastaan LIVE", an art rock live performance band, for using the word "OM" and clubbing it with phrases like "Ullu Ka Pattha" thereby allegedly outraging religious feelings of Hindus.  While finding merits in the submission made by the counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, a division bench comprising of Justice MS Jawalkar and Justice MS Sonak observed that the the Goa Police hurriedly registered the FIR without perusing the complaint or the provisions of sec. 295B of IPC.  In view of the said observation, the Bench opined that such a conduct by police authorities "was an unwarranted assault on creativity and freedom of speech and expression itself."  "According to us, there was no justification whatsoever for the Police Inspector to hurriedly register such an FIR, possibly without even going into the complaint or for that matter the provisions of Section 295-A of the IPC. The Police authorities are expected to be quite sensitive in such matters, because, what is at stake is the freedom of speech and expression. Therefore, unless the complaint discloses the ingredients of the offense under section 295-A of IPC, it is not expected of the Police authorities to rush and register an FIR in such cases. In any case, there was no justification whatsoever to call some of the Petitioners to the Police Station and require them to apologize or to arrest some of the Petitioners, no sooner the FIR was registered." The bench observed.  Observing that there was no allegation of deliberate or malicious intention to outrage religious feelings of any class of persons in the complaint, the Court observed that in absence of such allegations, there was no justification on the part of the Police to register the FIR.  "The criminal machinery ought not to have been set into motion based upon such a complaint. This was indeed the abuse of the process, because, it is apparent that the Police authorities have not even taken cognizance of the legal position explaining the scope of section 295-A of IPC by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramji Lal Mod case." the Bench observed at the outset.  Furthermore, the Court went ahead to observe that:  "In the present case, the Respondent, has precisely chosen to take a sentence here and a sentence there or rather, a word here and a word there and on such basis filed a vague complaint which does not even spell out the basic ingredients of section 295-A of IPC. Besides, the Police authorities have completely ignored the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court which provides that the effect of the words must be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm, and courageous men and not those of weak and vacillating minds nor of those who scent danger in every hostile point of view."  No Arrest Can Routinely Be Made on Mere Allegation of Commission of an Offence  While observing that the police officer must be able to justify the arrest apart from his power to do so, the Court observed that arrest and detention in police lock-up of a person can cause incalculable harm to his reputation and self-esteem.  "No arrest can be made routinely on a mere allegation of commission of an offense made against a person. It would be prudent for a police officer in the interest of protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen and perhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a reasonable belief both as to the person's complicity and even to the need to effect an arrest." The Court observed.  "Denying a person of his liberty is a serious matter. The recommendations of the Police Commission merely reflect the constitutional concomitants of the fundamental right to personal liberty and freedom. A person is not liable to arrest merely on the suspicion of complicity in an offense. There must be some reasonable justification in the opinion of the officer effecting the arrest that such arrest is necessary and justified. Except in heinous offences, an arrest must be avoided if a police officer issues notice to a person to attend the Station House and not to leave the station without permission would do." The Court observed at the outset. Also Read: Non-Deliberate Insult to Religion Without Intention to Hurt Religious Feelings Not An Offence U/S 295A IPC: Bombay High Court Title: Sudheer Rikhari v. State of Goa & Ors   
A victim can seek enhancement of her/ his offender's jail time (sentence) only through a revision application and not by filing an appeal against the trial court's judgement, the Bombay High Court has held.  The division bench of Justices Sadhana S. Jadhav and Milind N. Jadhav noted that the victim can prefer an appeal in view of the proviso under section 372 of the CrPC, only under three circumstances.  1.Against the acquittal of an accused.  2.When the accused is convicted for a lesser offence or  3.Inadequate compensation is awarded to the victim.   And while victim's appeal against sentence may not be maintainable under section 372 of the CrPC, a revision application under section 401 of the CrPC for the same relief would survive. Such an application is also recognised under Rule 2(II)(a) of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules 1960, the court said. The revision would go before a division bench.   "It is seen that undoubtedly a revision application for enhancement of sentence at the instance of the victim / complainant would be maintainable…However in view of the specific observations of the Supreme Court in the case of Parvinder Kansal (supra) and Mallikarjun Kodagali (supra), it is seen that the right to appeal against the sentence will not be available to the Appellant (victim) in view of the specific provisions of the statute," the court held.  Case  The bench ruled thus while dismissing the criminal appeal filed by a woman working for a multinational company who was sedated (328), conned (417) and threatened (506) by a prospective groom from Uttar Pradesh, after the woman's father placed a matrimonial advertisement in the 'Times of India,' in 2010.  The woman had filed an appeal in 2015, under section 372 of the CrPC seeking to enhance the punishment awarded to the man, from seven years to the maximum punishment of ten years. Despite two notices the woman was untraceable, after which, the court appointed advocate Mihir Joshi to espouse her cause.   As for the accused, he was released after serving his entire sentence, in 2016. Therefore, his appeal against conviction was infructuous.  Arguments  Advocate Mihir Joshi for the woman cited the judgement of Mallikarjun Kodagali v. State of Karnataka reported in (2019) 2 SCC 752, wherein it was observed that the proviso to section 372, under which a victim seeks remedy, is a social welfare legislation to empower a victim and challenge an unfavourable order passed by the trial court.   Therefore, the section should be given a meaning that is realistic, liberal, progressive and beneficial to the victim of an offence, he argued.  He pointed out notes of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2006 through which the proviso to section 372 was introduced. The notes, talk about a victim's right to appeal against "any adverse order" of the trial court.   The APP, PP Shinde for the State, argued that the victim's appeal was not maintainable. Because even though the Malimath Committee submitted a report recommending certain rights for victims in 2003, the parliament in its wisdom didn't specify that the victim had a right to appeal for enhancement of sentence.   Observations  The bench relied on the judgement of Parvinder Kansal Vs. The State of NCT of Delhi & Anr , wherein the Supreme Court held that the father's appeal, to enhance the convict's sentence from life imprisonment to death for murdering his child, was not maintainable. The court noted that only the state government can file an appeal against sentence under 377 of the CrPC.   The court observed that it was bound by the SC's decision but a perusal of the report presented to the Parliament of India / Rajya Sabha Secretariat and the Lok Sabha Secretariat, in 2007, did mention that the "Victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against any adverse order passed by the court."  Finally the bench held that a victim's revision application against sentence would be maintainable.   Case Title: Anand Singh Versus The State of Maharashtra, with connected matters     
The Supreme Court observed that the right provided to the victim to prefer an appeal against the order of acquittal is an absolute right and there is no necessity to obtain a special leave."The victim has not to pray for grant of special leave to appeal, as the victim has a statutory right of appeal under Section 372 proviso and the proviso to Section 372 does not stipulate any condition... The Supreme Court observed that the right provided to the victim to prefer an appeal against the order of acquittal is an absolute right and there is no necessity to obtain a special leave. "The victim has not to pray for grant of special leave to appeal, as the victim has a statutory right of appeal under Section 372 proviso and the proviso to Section 372 does not stipulate any condition of obtaining special leave to appeal like subsection (4) of Section 378 Cr.P.C", the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna observed in a judgment yesterday. In this case, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tiruchirapalli convicted the accused under the Sections 147, 148, 324, 326 IPC. and acquitted them under Sections 307 and 506(ii) IPC. The first appellate Court allowed the appeal preferred by the accused and acquitted the accused. The criminal appeals filed by the victims against acquittal of the accused under Sections 307 and 506(ii) IPC were dismissed. The victims thus preferred criminal revision application before the Madras High Court under Section 397 r/w 401 Cr.P.C. The High Court set aside the judgment and order passed by the first appellate Court and consequently  restored the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court. The issues raised in the appeal before the Supreme Court by the appellant-accused were the following: i) Whether the High Court in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction under Section 401 Cr.P.C. is justified in setting aside the order of acquittal and convicting the accused by converting the finding of acquittal into one of conviction?   ii) In a case where the victim has a right of appeal against the order of acquittal, now as provided under Section 372 Cr.P.C and the victim has not availed such a remedy and has not preferred the appeal, whether the revision application is required to be entertained at the instance of a party/victim instead of preferring an appeal?; and  iii) While exercising the powers under sub-section (5) of Section 401 Cr.P.C. treating the revision application as petition of appeal and deal with the same accordingly, the High Court is required to pass a judicial order? Regarding the first issue, the bench observed that a High Court while exercising revisional jurisdiction under Section 401 of Code of Criminal Procedure cannot convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction. While answering the second issue, the bench took note of the amendment in Section 372 Cr.P.C. after 2009. The proviso reads thus: The victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against any order passed by the Court acquitting the accused or convicting for a lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation, and such appeal shall lie to the Court to which an appeal ordinarily lies against the order of conviction of such Court. Referring to Mallikarjun Kodagali v. State of Karnataka, (2019) 2 SCC 752, the court observed:  10.1 It cannot be disputed that now after the amendment in Section 372 Cr.P.C. after 2009 and insertion of proviso to Section 372 Cr.P.C., a victim has a statutory right of appeal against the order of acquittal. Therefore, no revision shall be entertained at the instance of the victim against the order of acquittal in a case where no appeal is preferred and the victim is to be relegated to file an appeal. Even the same would be in the interest of the victim himself/herself as while exercising the revisional jurisdiction, the scope would be very limited, however, while exercising the appellate jurisdiction, the appellate Court would have a wider jurisdiction than the revisional jurisdiction. Similarly, in a case where an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon complaint, the complainant (other than victim) can prefer an appeal against the order of acquittal as provided under sub-section (4) of Section 378 Cr.P.C., subject to the grant of special leave to appeal by the High Court. As observed by this Court in the case of Mallikarjun Kodagali (supra), so far as the victim is concerned, the victim has not to pray for grant of special leave to appeal, as the victim has a statutory right of appeal under Section 372 proviso and the proviso to Section 372 does not stipulate any condition of obtaining special leave to appeal like subsection (4) of Section 378 Cr.P.C. in the case of a complainant and in a case where an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon complaint. The right provided to the victim to prefer an appeal against the order of acquittal is an absolute right. Therefore, so far as issue no.2 is concerned, namely, in a case where the victim and/or the complainant, as the case may be, has not preferred and/or availed the remedy of appeal against the order of acquittal as provided under Section 372 Cr.P.C. or Section 378(4), as the case may be, the revision application against the order of acquittal at the instance of the victim or the complainant, as the case may be, shall not be entertained and the victim or the complainant, as the case may be, shall be relegated to prefer the appeal as provided under Section 372 or Section 378(4), as the case may be. "However, considering the fact that even otherwise being victims they are having the statutory right of appeal as per proviso to Section 372 Cr.P.C., we deem it fit and proper to remit the matter to the High Court to treat the revision applications as petition of appeals under Section 372 Cr.P.C. and to decide the same in accordance with law and on their own merits. The same would be in the interests of all, namely, the victims as well as the accused, as the appellate Court would have a wider scope and jurisdiction as an appellate Court, rather than the revisional court", the court said while allowing the appeal. Mallikarjun Kodagali Judgment In Mallikarjun Kodagali, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court (2:1) had held that a victim can file an appeal in the High Court against the acquittal without seeking leave to appeal. The majority judgment authored by Justice Madan B. Lokur (Justice S. Abdul Nazeer concurring) concluded: "On the basis of the plain language of the law and also as interpreted by several High Courts and in addition the resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations, it is quite clear to us that a victim as defined in Section 2(wa) of the Cr.P.C. would be entitled to file an appeal before the Court to which an appeal ordinarily lies against the order of conviction." Justice Deepak Gupta wrote separate opinion dissenting with the majority view that there is no need of seeking leave to appeal in terms of Section 378(3) of CrPC. "In case, I accept the proposition that the victim need not seek leave to appeal in case the appeal is to be filed in the High Court there shall be another anomalous situation. Supposing there are two victims in a case and one of the victims files a complaint and sets the wheels of justice moving and the case is tried as a complaint case. In case the accused is acquitted and the victim who is the complainant wants to file an appeal in the High Court, he will have to seek special leave to appeal whereas the victim who had not even approached the Court at the initial stage will be entitled to file an appeal without seeking leave to appeal. This could not have been the intention of the Legislature.", the Judge said.           
The Madras High Court has observed that for a woman to claim the benefits of EPF Pension scheme after her deserted husband, it is necessary for her to lodge an FIR and get a police certificate as to whether he is alive or not.A single bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan made this observation while disposing of a writ petition filed by a woman, who was seeking the pensionary benefits under... The Madras High Court has observed that for a woman to claim the benefits of EPF Pension scheme after her deserted husband, it is necessary for her to lodge an FIR and get a police certificate as to whether he is alive or not. A single bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan made this observation while disposing of a writ petition filed by a woman, who was seeking the pensionary benefits under the Employees Pension Scheme after her son died. The petitioner said that her husband had deserted the family in 2005. Therefore, she prayed for a direction to the EPF authorities to release the pensionary benefits to her as per the nomination made by her son, without insisting on her husband's particulars. The counsel for the EPFO told the bench that in terms of 16 (5)(aa) of the Employees Pension Scheme 1995 , in case of non-nomination, the father of the deceased would be entitled to get full pension and in the event of death of the father, mother would be entitled to pension till she survives.   He further submitted that the writ petitioner should have filed FIR pertaining to the complaint given by her on account of missing of her husband and if his whereabouts are not found, she ought to have obtained certificate from the police, thereafter produce the same in order to enable the EPF authorities to process the papers and extend pensionery benefits to the petitioner. Since, the same has not been done, EPF will not be in a position to release any amount against the provisions of pension scheme 1995. The petitioner's counsel voiced the apprehension that the police may not entertain the complaint now as the petitioner's husband deserted her 15 years ago. The bench observed that the petitioner should have obtained the clearance from the police to claim the benefits. It noted that as per the scheme, the father of the deceased is entitled to pension and in the event of demise of the father, mother-wife is entitled to pension till she is alive. "Since, the deceased is a Bachelor, the writ-petitioner ought to have given the complaint on missing of her husband and ought to have obtained a certificate from the police, in order to get pensionery benefits, but the same has not been done", the bench observed. However, to redress the grievance of the petitioner, the Court allowed her to make a complaint before the police with respect to the missing of her husband within one month from the date of receipt of the copy of the court order. The police officers should accept such a complaint when it is made by the petitioner, and they are to verify and issue a certificate as to whether the person is alive or not traceable, the bench directed. "On a production of said certificate, writ petitioner who is the mother of the deceased shall be extended with the pensionery benefits, as the narrow interpretation of Section 16 (5)(aa) cannot be given, more so, in the peculiar circumstances of the case", the bench observed.

The Allahabad High Court has held that a daughter-in-law is very well entitled to allotment of a fair price shop on compassionate grounds. The Bench of Justice Manish Mathur relied upon an earlier judgment of the High Court wherein it was held that a widowed daughter-in-law is eligible for allotment of a fair price shop on compassionate grounds. Essentially, the Court was dealing with a writ plea filed by one Sharma Devi whose application for allotment of fair price shop on the compassionate ground had been rejected by the Government authority on the ground that she does not come within the definition of 'family' as described in paragraph IV(10) of the Government Order dated 5th August, 2019. It may be noted that this GO of August 2019 deals with the allotment of fair shops price and paragraph IV(10) lists out the kins/relatives of the original fair price shop owner who are eligible for such allotment upon the original owner's death. Petitioner's submissions Before the Court, the petitioner submitted before the Court that initially, her father-in-law was the fair price shop agreement holder of the fair price shop in question, however, subsequent to his passing away, she filed the application for compassionate allotment. However, her application was rejected. In this backdrop, her counsel submitted that the aspect that daughter in law does not come within the preview of 'family' has already been dealt with by the Court in the judgment and order in Pushpa Devi versus State of U.P. [Nov 2021/Writ-C No. 18519of 2021] case, wherein it was held that a widowed daughter-in-law could be allotted fair price shop on compassionate grounds. Court's observations At the outset, the Court observed that the case of the petitioner was fully covered by the judgment of the High Court in the case of Pushpa Devi and the Full Bench decision in the case of U.P. Power Corporation Limited versus Smt. Urmila Devi reported in 2011(3) ADJ 432. Further, the court observed that while it is correct that a daughter in law is not covered within the definition of 'family' in the government order dated 5th August 2019, but, the Court added that such an exclusion has already been held the ultra vires the Constitution of India in the judgment rendered by Full Bench of this Court in the case of U.P. Power Corporation Limited. "Although the aforesaid Full Bench judgment pertains to the right of a widowed daughter in law and in the present case the petitioner is not a widowed daughter in law but in the considered opinion of this Court, the same would not have any difference whatsoever and the rigor of the Full Bench would be applicable in the present case as well...Applying the same logic in the case of a daughter in law which has not been widowed, it can be seen that the later would have a better claim than a widowed daughter in law since she continues to be a part of the family as much as a widowed daughter in law. As such no distinction can be carved out between a daughter-in-law whose husband is alive and a widowed daughter-in-law," remarked the Court as it found that the rejection of petitioner's application for compassionate appointment as clearly unsustainable. In view of aforesaid, the impugned order was quashed and the Up Ziladhikari, Tehsil Bhinga, District Shrawasti was directed to reconsider the petitioner's application for appointment as fair price shop dealer on a compassionate basis expeditiously, within the period of six weeks.

The Meghalaya High Court on Monday granted bail to a teenager in a sexual assault case lodged against him under the provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) after taking into consideration that the minor victim and the accused were in a romantic relationship and that there was consensual sexual intercourse. Justice W Diengdoh observed, "On perusal of... The Meghalaya High Court on Monday granted bail to a teenager in a sexual assault case lodged against him under the provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) after taking into consideration that the minor victim and the accused were in a romantic relationship and that there was consensual sexual intercourse.  Justice W Diengdoh observed,  "On perusal of the records, particularly the statement of the victim and the accused, prima facie it is apparent that there is a romantic relationship between the two and that the sexual act involved between them was one of consensual, notwithstanding the fact that in the case of an alleged victim being a minor, consent has no legal validity, however, this aspect of the matter cannot be lost sight of while a plea for grant of bail is being considered by the court."  The Court further observed that there is 'no denial of the fact' that a romantic relationship existed between the accused and the alleged victim resulting in the lodging of the FIR by the complainant who is the mother of the alleged victim. It is a matter of evidence as to whether the alleged act constitutes sexual assault as per the provision of the POCSO Act, the Court stated further.  Reliance was also placed by the Court on the Madras High Court judgment in Vijayalakshmi & Anr. v. State wherein it was held that the POSCO Act did not intend to penalise teenagers in a relationship who consented to sexual acts between them.  In the instant case, a case was registered against the accused under Sections 5 and 6 (penetrative and aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. It was contended that the accused and the victim were stated to be in a romantic relationship with each other.  Counsel for the accused Advocate CB Sawian submitted that the accused is a teenager and is therefore incapable of understanding the consequences of his actions. Accordingly, it was contended that keeping him incarcerated with other inmates, some of whom may be harden criminals will have an impact on his future career.  It was argued further that the POCSO Act has been enacted to prevent cases of sexual assault on children, however, the Act does not contemplate punishment of teenagers who are involved in romantic love. It was also pointed out that the accused has been in judicial custody for almost 11 months, while the POCSO Act stipulates that cases have to be disposed of in a year.  On the other hand, Additional Advocate General B Bhattarcharjee, opposing the bail application, submitted that the accused is an adult who is booked with a serious charge. It was also submitted that the provisions of the POCSO Act does not distinguish between the severity of the offence whether it is a result of romantic love or otherwise. Whether he is 19 years or 40 years would make no difference in the eyes of the law, it was contended further. Pursuant to the perusal of the record, the Court noted that investigation was complete and that the charge sheet had been filed. Thereafter the Special Court (POCSO) had also taken cognizance of the charge sheet and that the case is now at the stage of evidence, it was noted further.  "The contention of the learned AAG on the applicability of the relevant provision of the POCSO Act and the severity of the offence involved would be subject to the appreciation of evidence adduced in the case. However, this Court while taking into the account the nature and gravity of the alleged offence has also to consider other aspects as far as consideration for grant of bail is concerned", the Court opined further.  Accordingly, Court allowed the bail plea on a personal bond of ₹20,000 with two sureties of like amount. The accused was directed  to not tamper with the case witnesses or abscond/leave the jurisdiction of the trial court without prior permission. Case Title: Ephina Khonglah v. State of Meghalaya     
The Gujarat High Court has held that a licensing authority under the Arms Act cannot discriminate between two persons, who were co-accused in the same matter, by renewing the license of one of them and refusing the same treatment to the other citing criminal antecedents.Justice AS Supehia held so while deciding the case of a Petitioner whose renewal application under the Act was declined... The Gujarat High Court has held that a licensing authority under the Arms Act cannot discriminate between two persons, who were co-accused in the same matter, by renewing the license of one of them and refusing the same treatment to the other citing criminal antecedents. Justice AS Supehia held so while deciding the case of a Petitioner whose renewal application under the Act was declined citing criminal offence registered against him under Sections 323, 294B, 506(1) and 114 of IPC. A similar application filed by the Petitioner's co-accused in the matter was however allowed by the authority. Thus, the bench concluded that discriminatory treatment was meted out to the Petitioner and it remanded the matter back to the Respondent authorities for fresh consideration.  The Petitioner averred that he was acquitted by the Sessions Court in the relevant criminal offence.  Per contra, the AGP submitted that the impugned order was correct since the Petitioner was only acquitted in view of a compromise between parties before the trial court.  Justice Supehia observed,  "This Court is not expressing any opinion with regard to acquittal of the petitioner, however, the petitioner is entitled to the same treatment, which has been extended to the co-accused Vijay M. Goswami. The Petitioner, who has been arraigned as an accused no.2, and the accused no.4-Vijay M. Goswami has been granted the renewal of the arm license, whereas a discriminatory treatment has been meted out to the petitioner for denying renewal of the arm license."  Keeping in view this discriminatory treatment, the authority was directed to pass 'necessary orders' regarding renewal of the license within one months.

The Allahabad High Court has clarified that for seeking appointment as Judicial Officer/District Judge as per Article 233 (2) of the Constitution of India, an Advocate has to be in continuous practice for not less than 7 years [with no break in between] as on the cut-off date and at the time of appointment as District Judge.It may be noted that Article 233 of the Constitution of India deals... The Allahabad High Court has clarified that for seeking appointment as Judicial Officer/District Judge as per Article 233 (2) of the Constitution of India, an Advocate has to be in continuous practice for not less than 7 years [with no break in between] as on the cut-off date and at the time of appointment as District Judge. It may be noted that Article 233 of the Constitution of India deals with the Appointment of district judges and its subclause (2) mandates that a person, not already in the service of the Union or of the State, shall only be eligible to be appointed a district judge if he has been for not less than seven years, an advocate or a pleader, and is recommended by the High Court for the appointment. The Bench of Justice Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Justice Ajai Tyagi relied upon the apex court's ruling in the case of Deepak Aggrawal v. Keshav Kaushik and others, (2013) 5 SCC 277, wherein it had been held that as per Article 233(2), a person seeking appointment as a District Judge must be practicing as an advocate for continuous 7 years (without any break) on the date of application. The case in brief Essentially, the Court was dealing with a plea filed by one Bindu who applied for being appointed as a Judicial Officer/District judge in the U.P. State Higher Judicial Services, however, after she cleared the preliminary exam, she was not permitted to appear for the final exams by the High Court on the administrative side on the ground that she does not have continuous practice as an advocate for seven years on the date of exam/filling form.  Against this backdrop, she moved to the Court praying that she be allowed to sit for the final examination. Court's observations  The Court noted that the petitioner ceased to be an Advocate under the Advocates Act, 1961 in August 2017 when she got selected as EXAMINER OF TRADEMARK & G.I. as in August 2017 she surrendered her practicing licence.  Thereafter in the year 2019, she was selected as Public Prosecutor in CBI where she is still working, however, the Court noted that she is a Public Prosecutor at present but as Public Prosecutor, she has not put in continuous service of 7 years so that she becomes eligible to sit for the final examination. "It is clear from the factual data that petitioner cannot seek appointment as Judicial Officer/District Judge in this calendar year as the petitioner does not fulfill the criteria fixed as per provisions of Articles 233, 234, and 236 of the Constitution of India...The term used "has been" [used under Article 233 (2)] is interpreted to mean seven years and has to be in present perfect continuous tense and not has been seven years during any period. This interpretation will not permit us to entertain this petition and grant the mandamus to permit the petitioner to appear in the exam," " the Court held. Significantly, the Court also underscored that when the petitioner was employed as an examiner of trademark & GI [during the period between 2017 to 2019], there was a break in her legal practice and this break can't be condoned in view of the clear mandate of Article 233 and the concerned rules. In view of these facts, this petition was dismissed.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has again issued notice to Youtuber/Commentator for his remarks against the Indian Judiciary in a recent Youtube interview where he made the below remark: "The entire higher judiciary is riddled with corruption" When the matter came up before the bench of Justice GR Swaminathan and Justice B Pugalendhi today, the court issued notice to Savukku Shankar as to why proceedings for criminal contempt should not be taken against him. The court also enquired as to the status of disciplinary proceedings against Savukku Shankar, who had been employed in the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption as ministerial staff.  On July 19, Justice GR Swaminathan directed the Madurai bench registry to register a suo motu case of criminal contempt against Savukku Shankar for his tweets against the judge. Savukku Shankar had through his tweets alleged that the Judge had "met someone" in connection to the proceedings against another Youtuber Maridhas thus raising questions on the order passed by the judge which was in favor of Maridhas. Through his tweets, Mr. Shankar suggested that the Judge was influenced by the person whom he met when he quashed the criminal prosecution against Maridhas who was charged for tweeting against the DMK government in Tamil Nadu.

The Bombay High Court has ruled that once a settlement is arrived at by the parties, the contract between the parties stands discharged by mutual agreement and hence, the dispute arising under the said contract is a deadwood which cannot be referred to arbitration. Observing that a party who conceals or suppresses facts, including the factum of a settlement, is disentitled to relief... The Bombay High Court has ruled that once a settlement is arrived at by the parties, the contract between the parties stands discharged by mutual agreement and hence, the dispute arising under the said contract is a deadwood which cannot be referred to arbitration.  Observing that a party who conceals or suppresses facts, including the factum of a settlement, is disentitled to relief under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act), the Single Bench of Justice G.S. Kulkarni held that a party cannot be allowed to resurrect the dead issues and foist an unwarranted arbitration after the contract between them stood discharged by a complete accord and satisfaction in terms of the settlement agreement arrived between them.  The applicant Vishwajit Sud & Co. and the respondent L & T Stec JV entered into Sub-Contract Agreements, under which the applicant was appointed as a sub-contractor. After the respondent allegedly refused to make payments for the work done by the applicant, the applicant issued a notice invoking the arbitration clause. The respondent, in its reply to the said notice, contended that a settlement was arrived at between the parties and therefore, the contract between the parties was discharged. The respondent averred that once a contract was discharged by way of settlement, neither the contract nor any dispute arising under the contract survived.  Consequently, the applicant filed an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) before the Bombay High Court for appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal.  The respondent- L & T Stec JV submitted before the High Court that a Settlement Agreement was executed by the parties and all the disputes under the Contract were put to an end, which was deliberately suppressed by the applicant in its application under Section 11 of the A&C act.  The applicant Vishwajit Sud & Co. averred that the issue whether there was an accord and satisfaction arrived at between the parties is required to be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal.  Noting that there was a settlement arrived at between the parties, the terms and conditions of which were completely known to the applicant, the Court accepted the contention of the respondent that the applicant attempted to arbitrate a dispute which was absolutely a deadwood.  The Court observed that eight months after the settlement agreement was signed by the parties, the applicant intended to wriggle out from the terms of the settlement on the ground that it was not an appropriate settlement and issued a notice invoking the arbitration agreement. The Court further noted that thereafter, the applicant issued a letter unconditionally withdrawing the said notice invoking arbitration and confirmed that the dispute stood amicably settled between the parties. However, after the respondent rejected the demand for further payment, as reagitated by the applicant, the applicant withdrew the settlement agreement and issued a fresh notice invoking arbitration.  Rejecting the contention of the applicant that there was any coercion or duress exercised by the respondent for getting the settlement agreement executed, the Court held that the said bald pleas of coercion were made without any supporting material and that the conduct of the applicant was clearly reprehensible.  Holding that no disclosure regarding the settlement between the parties was made in the pleadings filed before the Court, the Court held that the intention of the applicant to suppress materials and misguide the Court was clear.  "There is thus a clear attempt on the part of applicant appears to be to wriggle out of the settlement and drag the respondent into unwarranted arbitration so as to resurrect dead issues. The Court cannot be oblivious to such conduct of the applicants in which considering the reliefs as prayed for as such conduct of the applicants is certainly not a conduct of a bonafide litigant."  The Bench observed that the Delhi High Court in Sugam Construction (P) Ltd. versus Northern Railway Administration (2012) and in Fiberfill Engineers versus Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (2016) has held that the party who conceals or suppresses facts is disentitled to relief under Section 11 of the A&C Act and that on such ground itself, the proceedings under Section 11 are liable to be dismissed.  The Bench held that it was a clear case of accord and satisfaction, wherein the parties under the settlement agreement had decided to discharge the contract in full and final settlement.  "The legal position which would be brought about by virtue of a settlement agreement as entered between the parties is that such settlement would discharge the contract by mutual agreement which is a process akin to the process the parties having entered into a contract, thereafter decide to discharge the contract by mutual agreement. Such eventuality is well-known in common law as accord and satisfaction by substituted agreement.", the Court said.  Further, the Court noted that the Supreme Court in Union of India versus Kishorilal Gupta & Bros. (1959) had held that when there is an accord and satisfaction, the arbitration clause itself would perish with the original contract. The Apex Court had ruled that it is for the Court to decide in the facts of the case before it as to whether any cause of action at all would survive, not only under the contract but also under the arbitration agreement.  Additionally, in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Union of India & Ors. versus Master Construction Company (2011), the Court observed that where the dispute raised by the claimant with regard to the validity of the discharge voucher or no-claim certificate or the settlement agreement, prima facie, appears to be lacking in credibility, the dispute is not required to be referred to arbitration at all.  "Adverting to the position in law as being consistently held by the Supreme Court in the decisions as noted above, in the facts of the present case, it is crystal clear that the applicants with open eyes had entered into a settlement agreement with the respondent. If there was to be any apprehension of a fraud, coercion, undue influence or duress, the settlement agreement which was conceived on 31 October, 2020 could not have have ever been signed by the applicants on 2 July, 2021", the Court said.  Holding that the allegations of coercion were ex facie false which did not require adjudication, the Court ruled that in view of the complete accord and satisfaction in terms of the settlement agreement arrived at by the parties, the contract itself stood discharged.  The Court ruled that the applicant was attempting to resurrect the dead issues and foist an unwarranted arbitration on the respondent. Thus, the Bench dismissed the applications and imposed a cost of Rs. 50,000/- on the applicant for each of the applications filed by it.

The Calcutta High Court has recently quashed criminal proceedings initiated against a lawyer for providing allegedly false and improper legal advice which was instrumental in sanction of a bank loan to a company which was later declared as Non Performing Asset (NPA) with an outstanding due of Rs. 2.57 crores.  Justice Ananda Kumar Mukherjee observed that merely because the lawyer's opinion was not acceptable, criminal proceedings cannot be initiated against him especially in the absence of any tangible evidence that he was associated with other conspirators. "..it is beyond doubt that a lawyer owes an "unremitting loyalty" to the interests of the client and it is the lawyer's responsibility to act in a manner that would best advance the interest of the client. Merely because his opinion may not be acceptable, he cannot be mulcted with the criminal prosecution, particularly, in the absence of tangible evidence that he associated with other conspirators. At the most, he may be liable for gross negligence or professional misconduct if it is established by acceptable evidence and cannot be charged for the offence under sections 420 and 109 IPC along with other conspirators without proper and acceptable link between them", the Court observed.  The Court further opined that if there is a link for evidence to connect him with the other conspirators for causing loss to the institution undoubtedly, the prosecuting authorities are entitled to proceed under criminal prosecution however such tangible evidence is absent in the instant case.  In the instant case, the lawyer had been fastened with criminal liability under sections 420, 468, 471, 120B of the IPC. Thereafter, he had filed an application for quashing of the criminal proceedings initiated by the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Offences Wing, Kolkata before the concerned Metropolitan Magistrate.  Upon perusal of the record, the Court noted that the petitioner had not been named in the FIR and that if the complaint is taken on its face value and accepted in their entirety, no offence is constituted against the petitioner to make out a case against him. It was further opined that no material has surfaced in course of investigation to establish any manner of connection and involvement of the petitioner with the principal accused in defrauding the bank to disburse the loan to the company. It was also noted that there is no allegation or material in the charge sheet that the petitioner made any wrongful gain from the co-accused persons or he had any pecuniary benefit for preparing a wrong search report in favour of the company. The Court further observed that it is undisputed that the loan was sanctioned in favour of the accused company and that the title deeds and other fabricated and forged documents relating to the property were handed over to the concerned bank on arrangement made by the principal accused person, including the directors of the company who had applied for the loan. Opining that the petitioner should have been more careful in ascertaining the genuineness of the title deeds, the Court remarked,  "The petitioner considered such false and forged documents and prepared his report. He should have been more cautious and careful to hold search at the A.D.S.R office to ascertain if the Title Deeds where entered in the Register to determine ownership of the property and the genuineness of the Deeds and also find out the genuineness of the record of rights from the Land Revenue Office to unearth the names of recorded owner and the nature of the land. The petitioner appears to have been negligent by not fulfilling his duties in proper manner." However, the Court observed that the report prepared by the petitioner does not lead to any presumption that the petitioner had any connection with the actual beneficiaries for releasing of the loan. It was further stated that the allegations made in the complaint and the evidence collected against the petitioner in support of the same during investigation do not prima facie constitute commission of any offence of defrauding the bank by the petitioner. Reliance was also placed on the Supreme Court decision in Central Bureau of Investigation, Hydrabad v. K. Narayana Rao wherein the Apex Court had inter alia observed that criminal prosecution on the basis of such bald and omnibus allegations against the panel advocates of the Bank ought not to be allowed to proceed as the same constitutes an abuse of the process of the court and such prosecution may in all likelihood be abortive and futile. Furthermore, the Delhi High Court judgment in A. Kumar Sharma v. CBI was also relied upon wherein the High Court had quashed the proceeding against an panel advocate who had submitted a false search report in alleged collusion with the principal accused, holding therein that mere negligence or want of greater professional care and competence on the part of an advocate would not make him liable for a criminal offence in absence of tangible evidence. Accordingly, the Court set aside the criminal proceedings against the petitioner by observing,  " I find and have no hesitation to hold that there is no tangible evidence to establish any connection or collusion between the petitioner and other co- accused persons for the purpose of defrauding the bank in sanction of the loan amount. Even there is no iota of evidence in the charge sheet where from it would indicate that the petitioner due to such act had made a wrongful gain from the other beneficiaries. Under such circumstances continuation of this proceeding against the petitioner would amount to an abuse of the process of court" Case Title: Bhaskar Banerjee v. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr    
The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) plea seeking a direction to the State Government to construct the 'Ram Ban Gaman Marg' as per the historical evidence and to connect all such places where Lord Rama took rest at night during his forest Travel (Ban Gaman/वन-गमन). The Bench of Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice J. J. Munir observed that the issue raised by the Petitioner, a political person, cannot be decided in the writ petition. Therefore, the Court dismissed the plea. About Ram Ban Gaman Marg It is widely believed that Lord Rama, in his 14-year journey from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka, visited 248 prominent places where he either took rest or had some connection with them. Today these places are remembered as the forest journey of Rama (Ram Ban Gaman Path). In the State of Uttar Pradesh, the journey of Lord Rama started from Ram Janmabhoomi Ayodhya and went through Pratapgarh, Prayagraj, Kaushambi to Chitrakoot. This path is called Ram Vanagaman Path (राम वनगमन मार्ग). Its length is about 177 kilometers. The Uttar Pradesh Government has already taken a decision to develop Ram Vanagaman Marg with a cost of over Rs. 4000 crores. In connection with this decision, the instant PIL plea had been moved by Petitioner (Rajneesh Kumar Pandey). The PIL plea prayed for the following direction to the Union and the UP Governments: - To construct the Ram Ban Gaman Marg as per the history and evidence of Ram Ban Gaman Marg. - To modify the route which is published in the newspaper as per the evidence of record;  - If the 4 lane construction is not possible everywhere of Ram Ban Gaman Marg then the Authority concern constructs proper connectivity marg of Ram Ban Gaman Marg from all places of Ram Ban Gaman Marg. - To connect all places where Lord Ram took rest at night during the Travel of Forest (Ban Gaman). - To take proper action and not disobey the Route of the Lord Ram Ban Gaman and connect all the places where Lord Ram traveled during hi Ban Gaman. Stressing that the writ petition had been filed for some ulterior motive, the Court noted that the State must have conducted thorough research before making the decision to execute the project in question, and therefore, no direction can be issued for modification of the route of "Ram Van Gaman Marg". 
The Kerala High Court on Thursday held that testimony alone, of an interested party seeking exemption under Section 3(2) of Kerala Private Forest (Vesting and Assignments) Act, 1971, is not sufficient to establish that the disputed property was cultivated during a particular time. The Act prescribes that the ownership and possession of all private forests in the state of Kerala shall stand transferred to and be vested in the Government. Section 3(2) however is an exemption clause for land comprised in private forests held by an owner under his personal cultivation. A Division Bench consisting of Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice C. Jayachandran observed that grant of exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act taking stock of the applicant's case/claim only, without referring to any evidence in support thereof, is perverse and unsustainable in law. "Adequate evidence could have been adduced by examining a labourer, who had performed some work in the subject property, in connection with the cultivation claimed. Evidence could also have been led in the form of any agricultural income tax paid or such other records indicating cultivation..." The Court also made it clear that the state of affairs as on the cut off date should indicate, by the yardstick of preponderance of probability, that the land in question was in the cultivation of the applicant; however, the scope and ambit of the expression 'cultivation' as employed in Section 3(2) of the Act is not the same as 'spontaneous/natural growth'. It held, "The term 'cultivation' implies a systematic agricultural or farming activity, including tilling of the soil, sowing seeds of the particular crop, nurturing the same by supplying water, fertilizers, if any, required etc., until the crops are grown to such extent, so as to reap the produce. In the context of evidence, materials in individual support of the above facets of cultivation may not be possible/feasible." The Court was dealing with State's appeal against an order passed by Forest Tribunal, Kozhikode which though held that the disputed property is a private forest, which vests with the Government, but also granted exemption in favour of the Respondent (original applicant) under Section 3(2) of the Act. Special Government Pleader (Forest), Advocate Nagaraj Narayanan, averred that the impugned order is a non-speaking one and no reason other than a bald statement that the father of the respondent was cultivating in the property was given in the order. He further relied on a number of Kerala High Court decisions to contend that the burden of proof is on the respondent to prove that the cultivation in the subject property was produced by the applicant. On the contrary, the Counsel appearing for the respondent, Advocate Mohanakannan, pointed out that there was a specific pleading in the Original Application regarding the cultivation made by the applicant's father after purchasing the disputed property in 1961. It is shocking to note, remarked the Court, as no reason is stated in the impugned order to find the applicant is entitled to the exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act.  After considering the contentions raised by Counsels and pursuing the impugned order, the Court sided with the contentions raised by the Special Government Pleader that granting an exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act relying on just the claim made by the applicant without referring to any evidence is unsustainable in law. We find that the grant of exemption under Section 3(2) of the Act taking stock of the applicant's case/claim only, without referring to any evidence in support thereof, is perverse and unsustainable in law. In the instant case, the Court observed that the spontaneous/ natural growth of 6 to 7 tamarind trees or 3 chadachikora trees doesn't fulfil the requirement provided under the Act to hold that the land in question was held by the applicant as the owner under his personal cultivation.  Furthermore, the Court observed that for a claim under Section 3(3) of the Act, the intention for cultivation is relevant with respect to the time of purchase/transfer of the property by virtue of a registered deed. Such intention to cultivate harbored by the purchaser/assignee/lessee should be translated into action within a reasonable time from the date of execution of the registered deed and some acts in furtherance of cultivation should have been done, observed the Court.  On facts, the Court observed that since the applicant failed to establish any cultivation on the disputed property, then in such circumstance, any intention of the applicant's father in the year 1961 to cultivate the property would pale into significance, in consideration with the fact that no act in furtherance of such intention is established in evidence.  Furthermore, the requirement under Section 3(1) of the Act, for holding the property under a valid registered document is not satisfied as per section 3(1) of the MPPF Act, alienation of a private forest by way of sale, mortgage, lease or otherwise without the previous sanction of the District Collector is null and void. here the applicant has no case that the disputed property was purchased with sanction of the District Collector.  The Court thereby allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned order.  Case Title: State of Kerala & Anr. v. Veluswamy & Ors.   
"Now as the legal settled proposition which has been set-out here-in-above, considering the prevalent economy condition of the parties as well as even of the Country, the financial crisis can be considered to be one of the grounds for condonation of delay," the Gujarat High Court has held. The Bench comprising Justice AP Thaker made this observation with regard to a Civil Application... "Now as the legal settled proposition which has been set-out here-in-above, considering the prevalent economy condition of the parties as well as even of the Country, the financial crisis can be considered to be one of the grounds for condonation of delay," the Gujarat High Court has held. The Bench comprising Justice AP Thaker made this observation with regard to a Civil Application for condonation of delay of 399 days caused in preferring an appeal from an order wherein the Applicant was restrained from transferring, alienating or creating third party interest in the suit property.Now as the legal settled proposition which has been set-out here-in-above, considering the prevalent economy condition of the parties as well as even of the Country, the financial crisis can be considered to be one of the grounds for condonation of delay.  Background  In the instant case, the Trial Court had granted an injunction against the Applicant. The suit property was the ancestral land of the Deponent and subsequently, Respondent No 2 executed a registered sale deed in favour of the Applicant as he was sole owner of the property. The Deponent had contended that he had undivided share by virtue of birth in the family of the suit property as a co-parcener. Further, there was no infirmity with the order of the Trial Court since any third party interest would create multiplicity of litigation.  The Applicant's primary contention was that he was suffering from financial crisis and had no funds to challenge the impugned order or develop the subject property. Later, he gained some financial strength through his friends, whereby he decided to develop the land himself or through some developer. Further relying on N. Balakrishnan v. M. Krishnamurthy, AIR 1998 SC 3222, the Applicant averred that refusal to condone the delay will result in a meritorious matter being thrown out and the cause of justice would be defeated. AIR 1998 SC 3222  Per contra, Respondent No 1 averred that the delay was more than 1 year and the reason of financial crisis was not acceptable. No evidence was also produced in support of the causes cited for seeking condonation of delay. However, in the affidavit-in-rejoinder, the Applicant submitted the statement of the bank account to show that there was a financial crisis, indeed. Additionally, the Respondent alleged that the Applicant wanted to create third party interest in the suit property.   Judgement  The Bench primarily examined the holdings of various judgements cited by the parties. For instance, in N Balakrishnan, the Apex Court had opined:  "Sometimes delay of the shortest range may be uncondonable due to want of acceptable explanation whereas in certain other cases delay of very long range can be condoned as the explanation thereof is satisfactory."  Justice Thaker while clarifying that the merits of the case had no relevance at the instant stage, opined:  "It is axiomatic that condonation of delay is a matter of discretion of the Court. Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not say that such discretion can be exercised only if the delay is within a certain limited."  Further affirming that rules of limitation are not intended to destroy rights of the parties, the Court opined that the Applicant's explanation did not "smack of mala fides". However, Justice Thaker cautioned that when delays occur on part of one party, the other party suffers litigation expenses as well. Therefore, the Court must compensate opposite party for the loss. The Court averred that the sale deed was in favour of the Applicant as admitted by the opposite parties and owing to the prevalent economic condition in the country, it could not be said that the Applicant was employing dilatory tactics and the opposite party would also suffer no prejudice. Therefore, per Justice Thaker, genuine financial crises could be a reason for condoning delay and laches for the suffering party. Accordingly, the Application was allowed.

The Karnataka High Court recently refused to quash the defamation proceedings pending against the President of Bowring Institute, who allegedly circulated objectionable cartoons defaming the complainant (an expelled member of the institute), in the newsletter to other members of the institute.  A single judge bench of Justice K Natarajan dismissed the petition filed by Anoop Bajaj and said “Sending the defamatory statement and the cartoons directly insulting the respondent by way of such statement, attracts Section 499 of IPC and it is not sent in good faith by the public authority in order to attract Exception 8 to Section 499 of IPC.”   Jayanna had filed a private complaint in the year 2014, against the petitioner for offences punishable under Sections 500, 501, 504, 505(2) read with Section 120-B of IPC. The Magistrate, after recording the sworn statement of the complainant, took cognizance against the petitioner for the offence punishable under Section 500 of IPC.  It was alleged that on the special general body meeting called for by the petitioner, the petitioner sent a letter dated 09-05-2014, showing some pictures, cartoons and the defamatory pictures against the respondent which insulted the respondent intentionally.   Counsel for the petitioner contended that the letter issued by the petitioner will not attract the definition under Section 499 of IPC and there is no intention to defame the respondent-complainant. The petitioner sent a letter to make the members of the Institute understand about the criminal case filed against the respondent by the petitioner and the letter was within the members of the Institute and it was not publicized, it was submitted. Therefore, the ingredients of Section 499 of IPC will not attract and it squarely falls under Exception-8 to Section 499 of IPC, it was argued.  Secondly, it was contended that the Magistrate has not taken cognizance of the complaint filed by the respondent but posted the case for sworn statement, which is against the law and even otherwise, there is no application of mind while passing the order by the learned Magistrate. The bench perused the newsletter sent by the petition to other members wherein the first cartoon picture, he is referring to the respondent along with other three persons who are said to be the expelled members, conspiring to attack the petitioner. The second picture reveals that the respondent has hired a mob carrying placards, shouting abusive slogans and targeting a particular community. The third cartoon picture reveals that the respondent is showing muscle power along with others and assaulting the staff of the Institute.   The fourth picture indicates that the respondent is preventing the guards. The fifth picture reveals that the respondent is kneeling down holding the leg of the petitioner and requesting for pardon and the petitioner accused is standing with suit. The last cartoon picture reveals that because of conspiracy and communal hatred, the respondent is put in accused box of the Court and he is standing in front of the Magistrate facing the criminal trial.  Following which the bench said “On perusal of the pictures of the cartoon, it is clear that the petitioner-accused No.1 with an intention to tarnish the image of the respondent-complainant has shown these cartoon pictures as good as he has committed the robbery or dacoity or heinous crimes in the Institute.”  Rejecting the contention that these cartoon pictures are only to make the members of the Institute better understand the criminal case against the respondent, the bench said “The members of the Institute are educated people, business people and professionals. Such being the case, there is no need for the petitioner to depict the picture of the respondent by showing the cartoon pictures to the members of Institute, the members of the Institute are not the small kids, who are not able to understand the criminal case filed against the respondent by the petitioner.”  Noting that the meeting called by the petitioner was for taking further course of action against the respondent after filing off the criminal case for creating ruckus, the bench said “The petitioner was not required to make such a defamatory statement and cartoon pictures in the news letter sent to the members of the Institute by defaming the respondent.”  Further it expressed “The members cannot be considered as the members of the inner house, but they are all the public figures in the society and they are members of the Institute/club.”  Further rejecting the contention of the petitioner regarding taking cognizance by the Magistrate, the bench said “As per Section 200 Cr.P.C., the Magistrate has received the complaint, examined the complainant by taking cognizance and postponed the issuance of process and thereafter, he has issued the process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. Therefore, there is no flaw in the order passed by the Magistrate in taking cognizance of the offence against the petitioner.”  It added “It is well settled that, even in the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is no definition for the word 'cognizance'. It is only an application of mind by a Judge. Therefore, merely not mentioning the word 'cognizance', cannot be said that there is no cognizance taken by the Magistrate.”  Accordingly it dismissed the petition and directed the trial Court to dispose of the matter as early as possible, within 4 months on receipt of the order.

The Allahabad High Court has held that after the retirement of a government servant, if such employee is found to be guilty of grave misconduct or is found to have caused pecuniary loss to the Government, it is the Governor who can take action as provided in Article 351-A of the Civil Service Regulations.With this, the Bench of Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Shree Prakash Singh... The Allahabad High Court has held that after the retirement of a government servant, if such employee is found to be guilty of grave misconduct or is found to have caused pecuniary loss to the Government, it is the Governor who can take action as provided in Article 351-A of the Civil Service Regulations. With this, the Bench of Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Shree Prakash Singh held that the penalty of dismissal cannot be imposed on an officer/employee after his retirement after attaining the age of superannuation, however, withholding or withdrawing a pension and ordering the recovery from the pension is permissible and that too, by an order of the Governor as per the Article 351-A of the CSR. The case in brief The petitioner (Gaya Prasad Yadav) was recruited as a Constable of the Armed Police with the Uttar Pradesh Police. On certain charges relating to obtaining employment on the basis of certain allegedly forged education certificates, he was dismissed from service by means of an order in June 2009. Pursuant to HC's order (setting aside the dismissal order), the appellant-petitioner was reinstated in January 2014, however, the departmental proceedings were further carried out against him and he was again dismissed from service in July 2014. This order was again challenged in the High Court and again the dismissal order was set aside (in March 2018) on the ground that the order of punishment of dismissal did not refer to the show cause notice and the reply submitted by the appellant-petitioner to the said show cause notice.  The High Court also gave the liberty to the Superintendent of Police, Ambedkar Nagar to pass a fresh order in accordance with the law.  Pursuant to this order of the HC, a show cause notice was given to the appellant-petitioner in May 2018 to which he submitted his reply by means of his letter in July 2018. In the meantime, the petitioner retired in May 2015. However, the Superintendent of Police, Ambedkar Nagar passed an order in November 2018, reiterating the earlier order of dismissal and further stating that it will not be lawful to reinstate the appellant-petitioner in service. Challenging this very order, the Petitioner moved to the High Court It was his primary argument before the High Court that the appellant-petitioner had attained the age of superannuation in May 2015, as such in terms of the provisions contained in Article 351-A of the Civil Service Regulations, it is the Governor who had the authority to take action which could be confined only to the nature of action permissible and given in the said provision, that is to say, curtailment or withholding the pension or recovery therefrom. The issue before the Court Whether the order of dismissal could have been passed by the Superintendent of Police, Ambedkar Nagar after the appellant-petitioner had retired on attaining the age of superannuation in May 2015.  Court's observations At the outset, the Court persued Article 351-A of the CSR to note that once the government servant retires, it is the Governor who has the right of withholding or withdrawing the pension or any part of it, permanently or for a specified period. "...after retirement, withholding or withdrawing a pension and ordering the recovery from pension is permissible to be caused only by the Governor i.e. the State Government in terms of the Rules of Business, not only in case such employee is found causing pecuniary loss to the Government by his misconduct or negligence but also in a cases when the employee concerned is found guilty of grave misconduct." Regarding the continuation of the departmental proceedings against the petitioner, the Court noted that since the such proceedings were already instituted against him prior to his retirement on attaining the age of superannuation, no sanction under Article 351- A of the CSR was required to be taken from the Governor and such continuation was purely legal in nature. Now, regarding the question as to whether the order of dismissal of the appellant-petitioner could have been passed with a retrospective date, the Court was of the view that once an employee retires on attaining the age of superannuation, the punishment of dismissal or removal from service cannot be inflicted for the reason that if the person is not in employment, the question of terminating his services would not arise, unless there exists a specific rule in that behalf. In this regard, the Court also relied upon the Apex Court's ruling in the case of UCO Bank and others, Vs. Prabhakar Sadashiv Karvade (2018) 14 Supreme Court Cases 98 wherein it was held that a penalty of dismissal cannot be imposed on an officer/employee after his retirement after attaining the age of superannuation unless there exists a specific rule in that behalf. However, the Court did observe that if the disciplinary inquiry is instituted prior to the retirement of the employee concerned, the same will continue by operation of Article 351A of Civil Service Regulations, however, in such a case if the employee is found to be guilty of grave misconduct of or is found to have caused pecuniary loss to the Government, it is the Governor who can take action as provided in Article 351-A of the Civil Service Regulations. With this, the Court held that though the continuation of the proceedings was valid, the order of the Superintendent of Police, Ambedkar Nagar dismissing the petitioner from his service after his retirement was not valid.  Consequently, allowing the plea, the Court, however, clarified that it would be open to the respondents to take action in terms of the provisions contained in Article 351-A of Civil Service Regulations.

The Orissa High Court on Thursday, rejected the anticipatory bail application filed by a YouTuber, who is accused of taking drone-shots and capturing photos and videos of the holy temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri.

The Orissa High Court on Thursday, rejected the anticipatory bail application filed by a YouTuber, who is accused of taking drone-shots and capturing photos and videos of the holy temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri.  While denying relief to the petitioner, the single judge bench of Justice Chittaranjan Dash said:   “It is expected from a law-abiding citizen more particularly from a person in the stature of the Petitioner who claims to have gained experience of getting photographs and videograph of the monuments and heritage of importance irrespective of being a tourist or freelancer to adhere to a minimum caution by obtaining permission from the temple authority, if at all he had intention to take the over view of the Temple or its surroundings. Absence of it raises the question of bonafideness.”  Factual Background  The petitioner, who is a freelance tourist and a YouTuber by profession, visited Puri in the month of September. He also claimed to be a registered drone-operator. As the mobile app of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) did not show the Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri as ‘no flying zone’, he navigated his drone over the Temple premises for approximately five minutes and collected some photographs and videos of the temple.   Later on, he also uploaded a video on his YouTube channel. However, after receiving complaints, he withdrew the shared contents acknowledging his mistake and realising that the same might hurt the religious sentiments of the devotees of Lord Jagannath. He also released a video on his channel apologising for the mistake.  Subsequently, an FIR was lodged by the Sub-Inspector of Singhadwara Police Station, Puri alleging that the petitioner captured the photographs and also obtained video-clips of the temple and uploaded the same on his YouTube channel, which was circulated for commercial purposes. It was alleged that as the temple premises have been declared as ‘red zone’ as per the Drone Rules, 2021, he committed offences under Section 10(2) of the Aircraft Act, 1934 and Section 30(A)(4)(c) of the Jagannath Temple Act, 1955   Notably Section 30A(4)(c) of the Jagannath Temple Act reads: “Whoever takes inside the premises of the Temple any article knowing that the taking of such article is prohibited under any law or custom or by any declaration made and published in the prescribed manner by the Committee with due regard to the prevailing custom, public health, morality or the religious sentiments of the public; shall on conviction be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to two months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees or with both.”  Similarly, Section 10(2) of the Aircraft Act provides penalty for act in contravention of rule made under the Act.  Contentions  Srikar Kumar Rath, counsel for the petitioner contended that the FIR is vague as the DGCA and the CEO of the temple administration have not granted any sanction to lodge the complaint, which is a mandatory requirement. Therefore, he argued, the entire exercise is nothing but misuse and colourable exercise of power to penalize, harass and tarnish the image of the petitioner.   On the other side, Mr. Manoj Kumar Mohanty, Additional Standing Counsel for the State strenuously opposed the prayer of the petitioner. He submitted that the petitioner as a registered drone operator ought to have regards for the restrictions. It was contended that he cannot take a plea that the DGCA app did not reveal such a restriction, the app might not have detected the same since the drone was navigated over 400 ft. height.   He further submitted that the petitioner has not only violated the law but also hurt the religious sentiments of the devotees of Lord Jagannath and therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to avail the pre-arrest bail.  Court’s Observations  After hearing the submission made by both the sides, the Court noted that the temple of Lord Jagannath has been declared as a ‘red zone’ and thereby, flying drone over the same attracts offences under Section 10(2) of the Aircraft Act and Section 30A(4)(c) of the Jagannath Temple Act. It also held that the attempt of the petitioner in violating the Rule is prima facie ‘writ large’.  “Lord Jagannath Temple at Puri has been designated a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey and is a centrally protected monument. It is said, such monuments and heritage are treasure for a nation and symbol of pride of our civilization besides the religious belief. They help us to appreciate our past and the level of development, knowledge and thoughts. In a way, they provide life to our past. It is an onerous duty of every individual irrespective of caste, creed, religion and place to protect and preserve the sanctity, safety and security of such monuments more so when it attaches a belief and sentiment of a cult. Invasion thereto, in absence of a bonafideness under the guise or pretext of ignorance of the rule cannot be taken as an excuse”, the Court added.  The single judge bench also said that the petitioner could have exercised the minimum caution by obtaining permission from the temple administration before flying the drone. Absence of such an effort made it to doubt his bona fides. Accordingly, the anticipatory bail was rejected.     Case Title: Animesh Chakraborty v.

The Supreme Court observed that a person belonging to Scheduled Caste /Scheduled Tribe in relation to his original State of which he is permanent or an ordinarily resident cannot be deemed to be so in relation to any other State on his migration to that State. The court noted that as per Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, there is a restriction on sale, gift or bequest by a member of Scheduled Caste in favour of a person, who is not a member of Scheduled Caste. This provision is to protect a member of the Scheduled Caste belonging to the very State he belongs to, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed. Background As per Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, there is a restriction on sale, gift or bequest by a member of Scheduled Caste in favour of a person, who is not a member of Scheduled Caste. In this case, the purchaser was a Scheduled Caste belonging to State of Punjab and was ordinarily and permanent resident of the State of Punjab. A  suit was filed by the plaintiff seeking a declaration that the said sale deed is in violation of Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 and Section 13 of the Rajasthan Colonization Act, 1954. The suit was decreed, against which an appeal was preferred before the Rajasthan High Court. The High Court held that the defendant cannot claim the benefit of a Scheduled Caste in the State of Rajasthan for the purpose of purchase of the land belonging to a Scheduled Caste person of State of Rajasthan, which was given to original allottee as Scheduled Caste landless person. The issue thus before the Apex Court in the appeal filed by plaintiff was whether a person, who is a member of Scheduled Caste in Punjab, where he is residing, can claim the benefit of Scheduled Caste in Rajasthan in relation to Section  42 of the Rajasthan Colonization Act, 1954? Referring to the decisions in Marri Chandra Shekar Rao Vs. Dean, Geth G.S. Medical College and Others, (1990) 3 SCC 130 and Action Committee on Issue of Caste Certificate to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State of Maharashtra and Another Vs. Union of India and Another, (1994) 5 SCC 244 and subsequent judgments, the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed: It is to be noted that as per Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, there is a restriction on sale, gift or bequest by a member of Scheduled Caste in favour of a person, who is not a member of Scheduled Caste. Looking to the object and purpose of such a provision, it can be said that the said provision is to protect a member of the Scheduled Caste  belonging to the very State he belongs i.e., in the present case the State of Rajasthan. Being a Scheduled Caste in the State of Punjab whether the sale transaction in favour of the appellant ­ original defendant could have been saved from the bar under Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 is now not res integra. In view of the above, the appellant – original defendant being a Scheduled Caste belonging to State of Punjab and being an ordinarily and permanent resident of the State of Punjab cannot claim the benefit of a Scheduled Caste in the State of Rajasthan for the purpose of purchase of the land belonging to a Scheduled Caste person of State of Rajasthan, which was given to original allottee as Scheduled Caste landless person, and therefore, as rightly held by the Division Bench of the High Court, the sale transaction in favour of the appellant – original defendant was in clear breach and / or in violation of Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955. The court therefore held that the land transaction in favour of the defendant was in breach of Section 13 of the Rajasthan Colonization Act, 1954 and Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955.

While granting bail to an accused under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the Himachal Pradesh High Court said that it is highly unbelievable that the persons carrying a commercial quantity of contraband would keep documents relating to their identity in the same bag.  Justice Sandeep Sharma was of the view that this creates a suspicion about the correctness of the prosecution story; as usually, an identity card is kept in a purse or pocket, not in a bag that too with contraband. It observed, "Once, the bail petitioner was found carrying the wallet; it is not understood, instead is highly unbelievable that a person would keep his driving license and Adhaar card in a bag containing the contraband. Had one of the accused kept his DL /Adhaar card in a contraband pack, this court may have accepted that version. Still, it is highly unbelievable that both the accused had kept their Adhaar Card and DL card in the bag, allegedly recovered by the police, containing a commercial quantity of the contraband." A petition was filed under Section 439 of CrPC for the grant of bail filed under Sections 20 and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The prosecution's case was that the police stopped a Volvo bus to check and found bags in possession of the accused persons. The accused persons then claimed that some unknown person handed over the bag to them to deliver it to someone in Delhi.  It is also their case that DL, PAN Cards, and Adhaar Cards of both the accused were recovered from the bag containing the contraband,  Additional Advocate General Sudhir Bhatnagar while admitting the factum about the filing of challan in the competent court of law, contended that though nothing remains to be recovered from the present bail petitioner, he deserves no leniency.  There are eye-witness testimonies of the bus driver and conductor; however, they juxtaposed each other. The Court held that this causes serious doubt about the recovery of contraband from the petitioner's possession. It also found inconsistency in the prosecution story and the fard/recovery memo.  The Court noted that while both these witnesses admit their signatures on the recovery memo, they stated that their signatures were obtained on blank papers. Since the passengers sitting on the bus were pressurizing them to take the bus, they were allowed to take the bus. Noting that financial transactions placed on record by the prosecution revealed that the present bail petitioner and co-accused transferred some amount to a cafe-owner in Himachal, Madhya Pradesh. However, the Court noted that it is not sufficient to conclude the bail petitioner's conspiracy, if any, in the case, especially when they expressly set up a case that they do tour, traveling, and event management business. The Court noted that allegations of commercial quantity of contraband attract the rigor of Section 37. However, the Court noted that, on a bare perusal of Section 37 of the Act, it could be gathered that there is not a complete bar for this Court to grant bail in cases involving commercial quantity. Instead, in such cases, the court, after having afforded an opportunity of being heard by the public prosecutor, can proceed to grant bail in cases involving commercial quantity if it is satisfied that the accused has been falsely implicated and there is no likelihood of his indulging in such activities again during the trial.  For no reason to presume and believe that recovery is doubtful and perusal of the status report reveals that at present, no other stands registered against the bail petitioner under the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act. It referred to judicial precedent in which it was held that until the guilt of a person is proved under the law, they are deemed to be innocent. No fruitful purpose would be served by keeping the bail petitioner behind bars for an indefinite period during the trial, especially when nothing remains to be recovered from him.  It referred to the case of Dataram Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr, where it was held that an individual's freedom can not be curtailed for an indefinite period, especially when their guilt is yet to be proved. In Sanjay Chandra v. Central Bureau of Investigation (2012), the SC held that gravity alone could not be a decisive ground to deny bail; instead, the court must balance competing factors while exercising its discretion. The top court has repeatedly held that the object of bail is to secure the accused person's appearance at his trial by a reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative.  The Court held that otherwise, the usual rule is bail and not jail. The apex court in Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee and other various principles were laid down before granting of bai viz. prima facie case, nature, the gravity of accusation, punishment involved, apprehension of repetition of the offence, and witnesses being influenced.

The Delhi High Court has observed that deaf and para sportspersons have to be treated equally and neither category can be discriminated against the other.  Justice Prathiba M Singh was hearing the petitions moved by four sportspersons in 2020, who won medals in several international events. They have been assessed with having 100% disability in hearing and speaking. By way of the petitions, they sought equal treatment of deaf sports persons with other para-athletes. It was their case that sportspersons who participate in Deaflympics, being deaf, would be deserving of the same status as those who participate in Olympic games. The petitions referred to the Committee International of Silent Sports (CISS) Congress 2011 where a decision was taken at international level to accord the same status to Deaflympic games as to the Olympic games and Para-Olympic games.  The petitioners highlighted that the cash awards and other schemes available for other sportspersons do not apply in the same manner to persons with disabilities and for Para-Olympic sports. The pleas prayed for Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to frame proper policies in respect of deaf sports as well.  Noting that considerable changes have been brought, in respect of encouragement given both to general sportspersons and those with disabilities, since the pleas were filed, the court said that latest scheme shows that recognition in form of cash awards and other benefits has been extended not only to para sportspersons but also those participating in blind and deaf sports.  Justice Singh observed that the issuance of such schemes, awards and benefits, etc. is in the realm of policy of the government.  The court said that while in general there can be no doubt that persons with disabilities ought not to be discriminated against, the announcement of policies and schemes is to be done by the government and a specific benefit cannot be directed by the court. “In principle, there can be no doubt and even the Court confirms that deaf sport persons and para sport persons would have to be treated equally and neither category can be discriminated against the other. However, on the specific issues highlighted by the Petitioners, this Court is of the opinion that the same ought to be considered by the Respondent, after taking an overall view of the matter,” the court said.  The court disposed of the pleas with a direction that the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports would take a decision on the issues raised "in a manner which is fair to persons suffering from speaking and hearing disabilities." “The said decision shall be taken within a period of three months from today. In the meantime, since there are certain tournaments which are stated to be going on, if any interim support is to be given, the same shall be considered within four weeks,” the court ordered.

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to the former General Manager of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited and prime accused in the Corporation's EPF Scam, Parveen Kumar Gupta. The Bench of Justice Pankaj Bhatia has granted him bail on the condition of his furnishing personal bonds and two reliable sureties of Rs.5,00,000/- each to the satisfaction of the court concerned. The case in brief  In pursuance to an FIR registered in the case, Gupta was arrested by the EOW, Lucknow in November 2019, and a first charge sheet was filed against three persons, namely, the applicant, Sudhanshu Dwivedi, and Ayodhya Prasad Mishra in February 2020. In the FIR, it was alleged that in December 2016, in a meeting of the Trustees of which the applicant was then the Secretary took the decision with regard to the investment of funds available with the trust. One of the said decisions was to invest, the funds in the company known as Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL).  Subsequently, the CBI took over the investigation in August 2020, and it was allegedly found that the accused, along with his co-conspirators had allegedly misappropriated funds from the Uttar Pradesh State Power Sector Employees Gratuity Fund and the Uttar Pradesh State Power Sector Employees Pension Fund to invest in private sector entities in order to incur huge illegal commission. Such illegal investments were allegedly done in abject violation of the Companies Act, 1956, Employees Provident Fund, and Misc. Provisions Act, 1952 and provisions of the Indian Trust Act, 1882 as well as Rules framed thereunder. Arguments put forth Appearing for the bail applicant, Gupta, Advocates Kamini Jaiswal, and Purnendu Chakravarty mainly contended that the decision with regard to the investment was taken by a Committee in which one of the members was the applicant and the co-accused have already been enlarged on bail. Further, it was also contended that the CBI has not filed a charge sheet yet and no progress has been made in the trial. On the other hand, the Counsel for the CBI, Anurag Kumar Singh, opposed the bail application and argued that although the decision was taken by the Committee, however, the applicant benefited out of the said decision, inasmuch as, the son of the applicant in his statement had stated that around 30 crores commission was obtained from DHFL which was divided in between Ayodhya Prasad Mishra, the applicant and Sudhanshu Dwivedi.  Court's order The Court, at the outset, noted that the applicant is in custody since November 2019 and the charge sheets have already been filed and from March 2020, the date from which the CBI has taken over the investigation, no fresh charge-sheet has been filed. Therefore, stressing that there is nothing on record to demonstrate that the applicant if enlarged on bail can in any way adversely affect the investigation or the trial which has not even started, merely because of the quantum involved, and in view of the fact that the co-accused on similar charges have been enlarged on bail, the applicant was directed to be enlarged on bail.

The Supreme Court observed that when a clear case is made out for the offences alleged, the criminal proceedings cannot be quashed merely on the ground that "no useful purpose will be served by prolonging the proceedings of the case". The bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna reiterated that a High Court must pass a speaking and reasoned order while disposing petitions under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In this case, the Magistrate summoned the accused to face the trial for the offences punishable under Sections 307, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(10)(15) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Allowing the petition filed by the accused challenging this order, the Allahabad High Court quashed the criminal proceedings merely opining that "that no useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the proceedings of the case". Before the Apex court, the appellant contended that there is no independent application of mind by the High Court and no reasons whatsoever have been assigned while quashing the criminal proceedings. On the other hand, the respondent defended the impugned order. The court noted that the High Court has not discussed the allegations made against the accused persons and even on the legality and validity of the order passed by the Magistrate summoning the accused.  "The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is a cryptic, non­ speaking order. We find no independent application of mind by the High Court on the legality and validity of the order passed by the learned Magistrate summoning the accused. The learned Magistrate issued the summons against the accused after considering the statements of the complainant as well as the witnesses recorded under Sections 200 & 202 Cr.P.C. and after considering the evidence on record including the injury certificate. The same has been set aside by the High Court in a most cursory and casual manner. The manner in which the High Court has disposed of the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and quashed the criminal proceedings is not appreciated at all. In a catena of decisions, this Court has emphasized that the High Court must pass a speaking and reasoned order in such matters". While allowing the appeal, the bench further observed:  Even from the impugned order passed by the High Court it appears that while quashing the criminal proceedings, the High Court has observed that no useful purpose will be served by prolonging the proceedings of the case. The aforesaid cannot be a good ground and/or a ground at all to quash the criminal proceedings when a clear case was made out for the offences alleged. 6.4 The High Court has not at all observed on how the order passed by the learned Magistrate summoning the accused was wrong and/or erroneous. The manner in which the High Court has disposed of the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and has quashed the criminal proceedings is deprecated. When serious allegations for the offences under Sections 307, 504, 506 of the IPC and 9 Section 3(10)(15) of the Act were made, the High Court ought to have been more cautious and circumspect while considering the application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and quashing the criminal proceedings for the aforesaid offences.

The Delhi High Court has observed that the opportunity of re-examination cannot be used to give a chance to a witness to undo its statement made in cross-examination and fill in the lacunae in evidence. Justice Amit Bansal was dealing with a suit filed seeking to injunct the defendants, who were occupants, from unlawfully entering any part of the first floor including the balcony of a Shop on the ground floor of the premises.  Issues were framed in the suit on 2nd August, 2019 and a Local Commissioner was appointed to record evidence of the parties.  The Court had noted that in the proceedings before the Local Commissioner on 20th May, 2022, the counsel for the defendant made a request to re-examine a defence witness which was opposed by the counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff. Accordingly, the Local Commissioner had referred the matter to the Court for appropriate directions. It was contended on behalf of the counsel for the defendant that the defendant was entitled to re-examine the witness on account of the answers given by the said witness in the cross-examination.  It was argued that since the witness had replied only in 'yes' or 'no', he was entitled to re-examine the said witness to get a proper explanation from the witness in respect of the questions posed to her.  On the other hand, the counsel for the plaintiff vehemently opposed the said request by submitting that a witness cannot be allowed to be re-examined so as to provide an explanation when the said witness has answered the question in 'yes' or 'no'.  It was submitted that the witness was an educated person and a law graduate and had consciously chosen to give the answers in the aforesaid manner. The High Court was thus of the view that in the guise of re-examination, the counsel for the defendant could not have asked the witness to give further explanation to the answers given by her.  "There is no ambiguity in the answers given by the witness that requires explanation through re-examination. In the present case, the witness, who is a law graduate, has consciously chosen to give her answers in 'yes' or 'no' without giving any explanation in support thereof," the Court observed.  It added "Needless to state that any interpretation in respect of the answers given by the witness can be addressed by the counsels at the time of making submissions. Re-examination cannot be used to give a chance to the witness to undo the statement of the witness made in cross-examination and fill in the lacunae in evidence." Thus, the Court was of the view that no case for re-examination was made out. Accordingly, the Court directed that the plaintiff shall pay an additional sum of Rs.75,000 to the Local Commissioner. With the said observations, the Court placed the matter before the Local Commissioner on the dates fixed. Case Title: CAPITOL ART HOUSE (P) LTD v. NEHA DATTA

Dealing with its suo moto case raising concerns over proposed Kanwar Yatra in the State of U.P. (now canceled), the Supreme Court today asked the State authorities to ensure that any untoward incident directly affecting the lives of the public shall be looked upon sternly and prompt action is taken immediately. The Supreme Court stressed that the authorities must have regard to Article 144 of the Constitution of India which essentially mandates that all authorities, civil and judicial, in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme Court The Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman specifically observed thus: "We may only remind the authorities at all levels to have regard to Article 144 of the Constitution of India, and ensure that untoward incidents which directly affect the lives of the public will be looked upon sternly and prompt action taken immediately..." The Court further reminded the authorities of a paragraph in its order dated 16.07.2021, wherein it had said that in categorical terms that the State of Uttar Pradesh cannot go ahead with its decision to allow the Kanwar Yatra in the State amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Paragraph was related to the importance of the Citizens' of India's Right to Life  and it read thus:  "We are of the view that this is a matter which concerns everyone of us as citizens of India, and goes to the very heart of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which has a pride of place in the fundamental rights Chapter of our Constitution. The health of the citizenry of India and their right to "life" are paramount. All other sentiments, al beit religious, are subservient to this most basic fundamental right." It may be noted that the Kanwar Sanghs of different districts of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday decided to call off the Kanwar Yatra in Uttar Pradesh after holding consultations with the Uttar Pradesh Government. This came a day after the Supreme Court said in categorical terms that the State of Uttar Pradesh cannot go ahead with its decision to allow the Kanwar Yatra in the State amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Thereafter, today an application had been moved before the Supreme Court challenging the Kerala Government's decision to relax, for three days, Covid-19 induced lockdown restrictions in view upcoming Bakrid festival. Hearing the matter today along with its suo moto case, the Court asked the Kerala Government to file its response by the end of the day and directed the registry to list the matter as first item tomorrow. This order came after Supreme Court noted State Government's stand that like last year, this year too, the Kanwar yatra will be postponed.  Read order

The Kerala High Court has directed the State and the Travancore Devaswom Board (TBD) to broadly promulgate the facilities recently made available to Sabarimala pilgrims to facilitate entry to more devotees to the temple and to attend darshan therein, in view of the two month pilgrimage season. In a suo moto matter taken up based on the Sabarimala Special Commissioner's report, the Division Bench of Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice P.G Ajithkumar in its order observed: "The State and also Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) to give wide publicity through print and visual media about the facilities available to pilgrims, so that more number of devotees can have Sabarimala Darshan. In case of any difficulties faced by the devotees, it is for the officers concerned to report the said facts to the Special Commissioner or the Executive Officer so as to enable them to bring it to the notice of this Court for appropriate orders."   What Are The New Facilities Made Available For Sabarimala Devotees? More Verification Centres The report stated that pilgrims coming by long-distance buses are offloaded at Nilakkal for verification of virtual-Q coupons and Covid vaccination/test certificates, which according to the Special Commissioner generates significant delay. He had, therefore, suggested that more verification centres be opened. The State Attorney submitted that in addition to nine verification centres, three more centres are to be established at Nilakkal to verify virtual-Q coupons and Covid vaccination certificates. Besides, it was submitted that four more spot-booking centres at Thripunithura, Kodungallur, Chottanikkara and Thiruvilwamala respectively are being opened under the Cochin Devaswom Board. KSRTC Bus Fair  The report cited referred to complaints from pilgrims that Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is collecting excess fares from them and not providing an adequate number of buses. In this regard, the KSRTC Standing Counsel submitted that as per a Government Order dated July 7, 2020, in respect of service operated in connection with Mandalapooja at Sabarimala, during the two months of November and December, KSRTC may "realise" 30 per cent of the rates, in addition to the rates of fares fixed for the respective class of services. Going by the said order, the KSRTC is entitled to collect ₹56 and ₹106 as fare for AC and non AC buses respectively. However, it is charging only ₹50 and ₹80, he added. Raise Permitted Number of Devotees TDB Standing Counsel pointed out that the number of pilgrims having darshan at Sabarimala per day is now in the range of 38,000–40,000. The State Attorney submitted that a decision shall be taken in a joint meeting of all concerned, including the TDB, on the question as to whether the number of pilgrims permitted to visit Sabarimala per day is to be hiked. In a statement filed on behalf of the KSRTC, it was stated that 80 non AC buses and 40 AC buses are allotted for Nilakkal-Pampa services and an additional crew of 10 drivers and conductors are posted for the said service due to an increase in the number of pilgrims. Group Booking Regarding group booking on the virtual-Q platform, the State Attorney submitted that the facility was stopped after it was misused by certain travel agencies. Nevertheless, it has been decided that pilgrims from other States in a group of 40 - 50 persons, holding virtual-Q coupons, will be permitted even beyond the time limit prescribed in the respective coupons, subject to the availability of open slots. The KSRTC Standing Counsel submitted that if any request is made by groups minimum of 40 members, they will be permitted to be carried in a single bus from Nilakkal to Pampa and back. Such groups will also have the facility for online booking through the KSRTC Web Portal. Finding that the devotees were provided with adequate facilities, the Division Bench closed the matter recording the submissions made by the State government, TDB and KSRTC. Case Title: Suo Motu v. State of Kerala  
The Calcutta High Court on Monday removed Trinamool MLA Manik Bhattacharya from the post of Chairman of the Board of Primary Education with immediate effect in connection with alleged irregularities in the recruitment of teachers in state government-sponsored and aided primary schools. Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay had earlier ordered a court-monitored probe by a special investigation team of the CBI into the alleged illegal appointments of at least 269 primary teachers.  Such a direction was passed on the basis of the recommendation put forward by former CBI additional director Upendranath Biswas, who had headed the probe into the Bihar fodder scam that led to the conviction of that state's former chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav. A minister in the first Mamata Banerjee government from 2011 to 2016, Biswas had named one Chandan Mondal of Bagda, North 24 Parganas for allegedly giving jobs of primary school teachers in lieu of money. The Court further ordered that Ratna Chakraborty Bagchi, the Secretary of the Board, would remain in charge till a new appointment is made to the Chairman of the Board. Furthermore, Bhattacharya was instructed to appear in person before the Court by 2pm on Tuesday for further interrogation.  "..this court removes Mr. Manik Bhattacharya from the post of President of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education forthwith and I direct the Government to appoint any other fit person as President of the Board and till the new President is appointed, the Secretary of the Board namely, Ratna Chakraborty Bagchi will perform the function of the President of the Board", the Court ordered.  The Court further underscored that it shall not tolerate such an 'unscrupulous person' as President of West Bengal Board of Primary Education. Justice Gangopadhyay on Friday had further ordered that CBI Joint Director N. Venugopal shall head the SIT and supervise the whole investigation. The counsel appearing for the Court about the constitution of the SIT in accordance with his earlier order. The CBI submitted the names of six SIT members, who will be investigating the cases under close supervision of its anti-corruption branch's superintendent of police, and its joint director. The members of the SIT constituted are as follows, (i) Dharamveer Singh, Additional SP, CBI, ACB, Kolkata (ii) Satender Singh, Deputy SP, CBI, ACB, Kolkata (iii) K.C. Risinamol, Deputy SP, CBI, ACB, Kolkata (iv) Somnath Biswas, Inspector, CBI, ACB, Kolkata (v) Moloy Das, Inspector, CBI, ACB, Kolkata (vi) Imran Ashique, Inspector, CBI, ACB, Kolkata During the proceedings on Friday, senior counsel Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya appearing for the petitioners had requested CBI counsel Billwadal Bhattacharyya to reconsider the name of K.C. Risinamol for replacing her by some other officer of similar rank.

The Supreme Court, on Thursday(April 7), held that a direction issued by the Union Government is not binding on a State University and that it is only recommendatory. Holding so, the Court held that a Registrar of a State University cannot make a claim for a higher pay scale based on a circular issued by the Central Government. A Bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M.M. Sundresh allowed an appeal assailing the order of Uttarakhand High Court, which permitted the writ petition filed by a Registrar of State University seeking parity in pay with its counterparts in Central University(Case : State of Uttarakhand v. Sudhir Budakoti And Ors).  Factual Background  On 31.12.2008, the Department of Higher Education, the Ministry of Human Resources Development  of the Government of India published two communications pertaining to revision of pay scale of Lecturers and Registrar. The State of Uttarakhand accepted the revised pay scale recommended by the Government of India for its teaching faculties. The respondent no. 1 was appointed to the post of Registrar in with pay scale as prescribed in the 2006 Rules. After taking charge as the Assistant Registrar in Kumaon University, he filed a writ petition before the Uttarakhand High Court seeking parity in pay with Registrars of Central Universities. The High Court directed the State Government to look into his representation. In the meantime, his pay scale was revised in consonance with the Sixth Pay Commission on 05.04.2011, which was assailed by the respondent no. 1 as unconstitutional. The High Court allowed the writ petition.   Contentions raised by the appellant  On behalf of the State Government it was argued that the decision to accept the recommendation to revise pay scale for Lecturers and not for Registrars was a policy decision that does not fall within the ambit of judicial review. It was contended that the respondent no.1 had no right to seek parity. The State is not obligated to implement the revised pay scale of the Central Government in State Universities. Moreover, the respondent no. 1 was aware of the pay scale when he accepted the offer.   Contentions raised by the respondent  The respondent no.1 appearing in person submitted that he was also made to undertake work assigned to a lecturer. He contended that the revised pay scale was extended to Lecturers and not Registrars and therefore perpetuates discrimination.   Analysis by the Supreme Court  Citing a catena of judgments, the Court noted that when there is a reason for classification, then Courts cannot insist on absolute equality. Discrimination based on reasonable  classification and meant for providing benefits to certain categories of people who form a class of their own is not arbitrary. It observed that when classification emanates from a policy decision, which is based on analysis of relevant material and on the recommendation of a body of experts, the courts are not to act like appellate authorities and ought to exercise restraint.   Referring to Kalyani Mathivanan v. K.V. Jeyaraj (2015) 6 SCC 363, the Court was of the opinion that it is trite law, the recommendation of the Central Government was merely directory for the Universities governed by State legislations. "Law has become quite settled that the Appellant(State of Uttarkhand) is not bound by any direction issued by the Central Government which would at worst be mandatory to the Central Universities and the Central Government Colleges receiving funds. Thus, any such decision would obviously be directory to State GovernmentColleges and Universities, being in the nature of a mere recommendation"  It further noted -  "In the absence of any legal right with the corresponding duty, such a relief can never be asked for, particularly when there are clear and specific rules provided for the pay scale of Registrars by the Appellant itself. The decision of the Appellant qua the Lecturers who form a distinct group as against the Respondent No. 1 who holds a higher position in the administration has been lost sight of. Merely because Respondent No. 1 was made to fill the gap by temporarily taking up the job of a Lecturer, he would never become one and so also a Lecturer, who might undertake the job of a Registrar."

Case No. and Date: Civil Appeal No. 2661 of 2015 | 7 April 2022  Corum: Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M.M. Sundresh  Headnotes:  Article 14 of the Constitution - When there is a reasonable basis for a classification the Court is not expected to insist on absolute equality by taking a rigid and pedantic view - such a discrimination would not be termed as arbitrary as the object of the classification itself is meant for providing benefits to an identified group of persons who form a class of their own - courts cannot not act like appellate authorities especially when a classification is introduced by way of a policy decision clearly identifying the group of beneficiaries by analysing the relevant materials - when a classification is made on the recommendation made by a body of experts courts will have to be more wary of entering into the said arena as its interference would amount to substituting its views, a process which is best avoided - when classification is distinct and clear having adequate rationale with due relation to the objective, there is no reason to hold otherwise by treating a Registrar at par with the Lecturers.  Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973 - a Registrar of a University is not entitled to accept any remuneration for other work, save as provided under the Uttarakhand State University (Centralised Services) Rules, 2006 - State is not bound to implement direction issued by the Central Government on State Universities - any such decision would merely be in the nature of recommendation.                     
The Madras High Court has quashed a notification issued by the Registrar of NCLT which made it mandatory for advocates appearing before any bench of NCLT to wear gowns.  Earlier, a bench of Justice K Ravichandrabaabu (since retired) and Justice TS Sivagnanam had ordered an interim stay on the operation of the order holding it to be in conflict with the Rules of the Bar Council of India which make wearing of gowns mandatory for an advocate only in case she or he is appearing in the Supreme Court or the high courts. The division bench of Justice R Mahadevan and Justice Mohammed Shaffiq in the judgment noted that as per Section 34 of the Advocates Act and the Bar Council of India Rules, only the High Court can frame rules for the dress code for the appearance of advocates. "In absentia, the rules in chapter IV of the Bar Council of India Rules shall prevail and the Tribunals have no authority to issue any instructions determining the dress code for the appearance of the advocates before it. When there are statutory rules framed by the competent authority and when the statute has conferred the powers on the High Court with reference to prescription of the dress code, any instruction, direction, advisory by the Tribunal, especially when it runs contrary to the statutory rules, is ultravires the Act, and without there being any source of power for issuance of such directions." It also said that it could be inferred that the wearing of “gown” is only optional and not mandatory before any courts other than the Supreme Court or the High Cours  The court added that the powers prescribed under Rule 51 of the NCLT Rules are merely for discharging functions as per the Act, in accordance with the principles of natural justice and equity. The same could not mean conferring power to prescribe the dress code, more so when it is contrary to the Bar Council of India rules, it said.  The court also noted that “other powers” granted to the President of the NCLT are with respect to the administrative power of the President and that also could not be stretched to include the power to frame any rule or issue any instruction, in the nature of the one impugned, to prescribe the dress code for the advocates.   The court noted that during the pendency of proceedings, the NCLT modified its earlier order and followed the Bar Council of India Rules with respect to the dress code for legal practitioners.  "The proceedings dated 27.01.2023 is taken on record. However, the impugned order, though withdrawn, will stand quashed on the basis of the reasoning as adumbrated hereinbefore," it added.

The Supreme Court held that parties to a contract who are Indian nationals or Companies incorporated in India can choose a forum for arbitration outside India."Nothing stands in the way of party autonomy in designating a seat of arbitration outside India even when both parties happen to be Indian nationals", the bench headed by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman observed.The bench was considering... The Supreme Court held that parties to a contract who are Indian nationals or Companies incorporated in India can choose a forum for arbitration outside India. "Nothing stands in the way of party autonomy in designating a seat of arbitration outside India even when both parties happen to be Indian nationals", the bench headed by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman observed. The bench was considering the question whether two companies incorporated in India can choose a forum for arbitration outside India in the case  PASL Wind Solutions Private Limited Vs. GE Power Conversion India Private Limited. In this case, a contract was entered between two companies, both incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 1956. Clause 6 (Arbitration Clause) provided that the disputes between them shall be referred to and finally resolved by Arbitration in Zurich in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. As the disputes eventually arose between the Companies, it was referred to arbitration before International Chamber of Commerce. One of the parties filed a preliminary application challenging the jurisdiction of the arbitrator on the ground that two Indian parties could not have chosen a foreign seat of arbitration. This objection was rejected by the Arbitrator who continued the proceedings and passed Final Award. The successful party filed enforcement proceedings under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration Act before the High Court of Gujarat.  Before the Apex Court, the appellant company contended that :  (1) Two Indian parties cannot designate a seat of arbitration outside India as doing so would be contrary to section 23 of the Indian Contract Act,  read with section 28(1)(a) and section 34(2A) of the Arbitration Act.  (2) Foreign awards contemplated under Part II of the Arbitration Act arise only from international commercial arbitrations. "International commercial arbitration", as has been defined in section 2(1)(f) of the Arbitration Act, would make it clear that there has to be a foreign element when parties arbitrate outside India, the foreign element being that at least one of the parties is, inter alia, a national of a country other than India, or habitually resident in a country other than India, or a body corporate incorporated outside India. For this reason, the award passed in the present case cannot be designated as a foreign award under Part II of the Arbitration Act.  (3) When there is no foreign element involved in an award made in Zurich between two Indian companies, such award cannot be the subject matter of challenge or enforcement either under Part I or Part II of the Arbitration Act.  (4) There is a head-on conflict between section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act and section 47 of the Arbitration Act, as a result of which the former must prevail. To address these contentions, the bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy, referred to various provisions of the Arbitration Act and various precedents and made the following observations: Part I and Part II of the Arbitration Act are mutually exclusive  The Arbitration Act is in four parts. Part I deals with arbitrations where the seat is in India and has no application to a foreign-seated arbitration. It is, therefore, a complete code in dealing with appointment of arbitrators, commencement of arbitration, making of an award and challenges to the aforesaid award as well as execution of such awards. On the other hand, Part II is not concerned with the arbitral proceedings at all. It is concerned only with the enforcement of a foreign award, as defined, in India. Section 45 alone deals with referring the parties to arbitration in the circumstances mentioned therein. Barring this exception, in any case, Part II does not apply to arbitral proceedings once commenced in a country outside India Re: Section 23 Contract Act Freedom of contract needs to be balanced with clear and undeniable harm to the public, even if the facts of a particular case do not fall within the crystallised principles enumerated in well-established 'heads' of public policy. The question that then arises is whether there is anything in the public policy of India, as so understood, which interdicts the party autonomy of two Indian persons referring their disputes to arbitration at a neutral forum outside India. Re Section 28, 34 Arbitration Act Section 28(1)(a) of the Arbitration Act, when read with section 2(2), section 2(6) and section 4, provides that, where the place of arbitration is situated in India, in an arbitration other than an international commercial arbitration (i.e. an arbitration where none of the parties, inter alia, happens to be a national of a foreign country or habitually resident in a foreign country), the arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in India. The Appellant's contention was that since two Indian parties cannot opt out of the substantive law of India and therefore, ought to be confined to arbitrations in India, Indian public policy, as reflected in these two sections, ought to prevail "52. It can be seen that section 28(1)(a) of the Arbitration Act makes no reference to an arbitration being conducted between two Indian parties in a country other than India, and cannot be held, by some tortuous process of reasoning, to interdict two Indian parties from resolving their disputes at a neutral forum in a country other than India.  Take the case of an Indian national who is habitually resident in a country outside India. Any dispute between such Indian national and an Indian national who is habitually resident in India would attract the provisions of section 2(1)(f)(i) and, consequently, section 28(1)(b) of the Arbitration Act, in which case two Indian nationals would be entitled to have their dispute decided in India in accordance with the rules of law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute, which need not be Indian law. This, by itself, is a strong indicator that section 28 of the Arbitration Act cannot be read in the manner suggested by Mr. Himani.", the court said while rejecting this contention. Re: Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act.   "We have already seen how "international commercial arbitration", when used in the proviso to section 2(2) of the Arbitration Act, does not refer to the definition contained in section 2(1)(f) but would have reference to arbitrations which take place outside India, awards made in such arbitrations being enforceable under Part II of the Arbitration Act. It will be noted that section 10(1) applies to international commercial arbitrations, and applications or appeals arising therefrom, under both Parts I and II of the Arbitration Act. When applications or appeals arise out of such arbitrations under Part I, where the place of arbitration is in India, undoubtedly, the definition of "international commercial arbitration" in section 2(1)(f) will govern. However, when applied to Part II, "international commercial arbitration" has reference to a place of arbitration which is international in the sense of the arbitration taking place outside India. Thus construed, there is no clash at all between section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act and the explanation to section 47 of the Arbitration Act, as an arbitration resulting in a foreign award, as defined under section 44 of the Arbitration Act, will be enforceable only in a High Court under section 10(1) of the Commercial Courts Act, and not in a district court under section 10(2) or section 10(3)." GE Power was led by senior counsel Nakul Dewan instructed by Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas Partner Shaneen Parikh, Principal Associate Shalaka Patil and Associate Surya Karan Sambyal.

The Rajasthan High Court has granted bail to judicial officer Jitendra Singh Guliya and two judicial clerks. All the three accused are in custody for the offences punishable under section 377/34 of I.P.C. and 5/6 of P.O.C.S.O. Act.

The Rajasthan High Court has granted bail to judicial officer Jitendra Singh Guliya and two judicial clerks. All the three accused are in custody for the offences punishable under section 377/34 of I.P.C. and 5/6 of P.O.C.S.O. Act.  Last year, the Rajasthan High Court suspended Jitendra Singh Guliya, with immediate effect pending preliminary enquiry and contemplated departmental enquiry. An order to this effect was issued by the High Court's Registrar General, under the direction of the Chief Justice of the High Court. He was posted as Special Judge, Special Court, Prevention of Corruption Act, Bharatpur.  Justice Farjand Ali, while granting bail to the accused persons, observed,  "All the accused persons are government servants out of which one is a Judicial officer and if the pre-conviction detention does not lead to conviction then compensation for such detention whereby tarnishing the reputation of an individual holding a Judicial post will never be compensated. Thus, the detention is not supposed to be punitive or preventive; and for the reasons as noted above this court is of the considered view that since the accused is languishing in judicial custody, his further incarceration would not serve any fruitful purpose."  The court noted that this order relates to criminal prosecution only. The court observed that the High Court in its administrative side, has already initiated an inquiry, as far as maintaining judicial discipline, morality or colourable exercise of power by the judicial officer is concerned. Thus, for the above, the administrative committee will surely exercise authority independent of this order, added the court.  It was opined that the pre-conviction detention is not warranted by law. The primary principle of criminal law is that an imprisonment may follow after a judgment of guilt, but should not precede it, added the court. The court observed that there is also another principle which makes it desirable to ensure that the accused is present to receive his sentence in the event of being found guilty.  Further, it was observed that the object of keeping the person in custody is to ensure his availability to face the trial and to receive the sentence that may be passed. The court noted that neither any apprehension has been shown by the respondent nor any material has been made available from which an inference can be drawn regarding the aforesaid apprehension. The seriousness of the allegations or the availability of the material in respect thereof are not the only considerations for declining the bail, added the court.  In addition, the court observed that the gravity of the offence or the severity of punishment alone is not a factor to be considered while adjudicating the bail plea. There are several other aspects which are required to be considered simultaneously with the gravity of nature i.e. if there is any apprehension that if the accused will be released on bail, he would hamper the prosecution evidence or would flee from justice or would not be readily available for the trial or otherwise hamper the course of smooth trial, the court also opined.  The counsel for the petitioner submitted that statements of elder brother "K" are very relevant as his younger brother had never complained that the petitioner ill treated or he observed any unnatural conduct on his part towards him rather he fortified that they took Rs.20,000/- as loan for Scooty from the petitioner Jitendra. He argued that the allegation that both the accused Rahul & Anshul told the victim to allow them too the same sexual act which their officer used to commit seems to be absurd in view of the fact that nowhere it has come on record as to how Rahul and Anshul came to know about the alleged sexual act. Rahul and Anshul are judicial clerks of the court and are not resident of the same locality, he added.  Moreover, he pointed out that nothing has come in the medical examination report of the alleged child victim which goes on to suggest that the alleged sexual act was committed; no injury marks were found on the body part of the child which definitely negates entirely cooked up story of the complainant. More so, no alleged video came to be found in the investigation, no obscene material has been detected from the mobile of the accused which was seized by the Police, now charge-sheet has been filed, he argued further.  The public prosecutor as well as counsel for the complainant opposed the bail application of the petitioners upon the ground that the offences are of a serious nature and the statements made under 161 and 164 of CrPC, are very much consistent with each other along with the other material on record, therefore, the accused petitioners shall not be released on bail and the same deserved to be dismissed.  The court remarked that observation in this order shall not have any impact at any stage of the trial. The same is observed in respect of the limited issue of granting bail and not otherwise, the court added. The court ordered that the accused-petitioners shall be enlarged on bail provided each of them furnishes a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the trial Judge for their appearance before the court.  Brief Facts  On 31.01.2021, child victim's mother-complainant filed an FIR, wherein she alleged that her child aged about 14 years, used to play tennis at District club Company where he came into contact with accused Jitendra Guliya who also used to come there for playing tennis. The accused Jitendra Guliya established good acquaintance with her son and coaxed her minor child to accompany him at his residence where he made her son drink some intoxicating substance and thereafter, sexually abused him by committing unnatural sex with him. In the complaint it is alleged that the accused Jitendra Singh had videographed the incident and also threatened her minor son to face dire consequences, if he tells anyone.  As per F.I.R, when the accused came to drop the victim, she saw the accused kissing her son on his lips in the car. After serious persuasion, victim had narrated the entire incident as to how he was being subjected to sexual abuse by the accused persons Jitendra Singh Guliya, Rahul Katara and Anshul Soni, since a month. Later, all the accused along with one police officer P.L Yadav came to her residence and threatened her to allow her son "H" to accompany Guliya for her good, else she would face dire consequences.  The complainant alleged that on the same day in the night accused Jitendra Singh had made a phone call to her; where, it was alleged that he was threatening her however, when she made him know that she was aware of everything about him and after hearing the same, the call was disconnected by the accused. It was asserted by the complainant that, on 30.10.2021 accused persons had admitted their guilt and asked her to forgive them for their wrongful act and further assured that they will not repeat the same in future. And later, it was stated in the F.I.R. that all the accused persons along with the aid of a Police officer P.L. Yadav, conspired to frame the complainant in a false case of extortion.

The Telangana High Court in a recent ruling following the Supreme Court decision in Radhey Shyam Gupta v. Punjab National Bank (2009) held that the pension and gratuity amounts of a retired employee cannot be attached for satisfaction of a decree of any Court.  Brief Facts  This writ application was filed by the Petitioner seeking a Writ of Mandamus against the respondent for not releasing her pension and gratuity. The Petitioner was working as a Record Assistant in the office of the Respondent and retired from service on 31.07.2020 on attaining the age of superannuation.  Soon after her retirement, when the petitioner followed up for her retirement benefits, it was brought to her notice that the Civil Court had passed directions to Respondent to withhold Petitioner's salary, leave encashment and other benefits as under Section 60 of the CPC as she was a guarantor/surety for loan transactions that had been defaulted.  The counsel for petitioner contended that the direction of the Civil Court was to withhold salary, leave encashment but the respondent has stopped pension, gratuity and other pensionary benefits which is not permissible under Section 60 of CPC and under Section 11 of the Pensions Act, 1871 and Section 13 of Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.  Ruling of the Court :  Justice P. Madhavi Devi examined the facts of the case and relied on the decision of the Apex Court in Radhey Shyam (Supra) wherein it was held that "the pension and gratuity of the Petitioner cannot be attached and cannot be withheld for appropriation of a decree of any Civil Court."  The court observed that in clause (g) to Section 60(1) of CPC (Property liable to attachment and sale in execution of decree), the pension and gratuity amounts of a retired employee cannot be attached for satisfaction of a decree of any Court.  Hence, the Court directed the Respondent to pay the entire amount of pension and gratuity as eligible. However, it was made clear that Petitioner would not be entitled for payment towards encashment of leave as it is not exempted from attachment under Section 60 CPC.   The writ was partially allowed.

The Gujarat High Court recently granted bail to a man accused of participating in gang-rape of the prosecutrix, after noting that the latter was on very friendly terms with the accused and even after levelling such grave allegations, she had been travelling with him and had been enjoying his hospitality.Justice Rajendra Sareen observed,"The facts narrated hereinabove prima facie reveal that... The Gujarat High Court recently granted bail to a man accused of participating in gang-rape of the prosecutrix, after noting that the latter was on very friendly terms with the accused and even after levelling such grave allegations, she had been travelling with him and had been enjoying his hospitality. Justice Rajendra Sareen observed, "The facts narrated hereinabove prima facie reveal that the first informant was on very friendly terms with the applicant. It also appears that allegation of rape appears to be unjustified, since all the while the first informant, had been enjoying the hospitality of the applicant and other accused, as the case may be, and there does not appear to be any justification for the first informant in continuously accepting the hospitality of the accused, when according to the first informant, she was being subjected to such a heinous crime."  The High Court further noted that the Prosecutrix) was well-educated and not from a poor socio-economic background such that she could be compelled to accompany the Accused persons.  The Court also did not find merit in the allegations that the rape was video-graphed and the first informant was blackmailed, since no material was available to substantiate the same despite investigation.   The Court was hearing an application filed by one of the accused persons, seeking bail on parity with the other co-accused. He was booked for offences under Sections 376(D), 120(B), 406, 294(B), 506(2), 328, 362 and 114 IPC.  The APP opposed the application on the ground that the prosecutrix first informant was threatened and intimidated to settle the matter, therefore, releasing the applicant would lead to tampering of evidence.  The High Court noted that the Prosecutrix had indeed travelled along with the accused to Gandhidham and then allegations were made during the journey in which the Applicant was not named. After her return to Ahmedabad, she had gone to Goa on vacation. "These facts prima facie reveal that probably no such incident had taken place on 11.09.2020, and therefore the first informant had behaved absolutely normally," the Court said and granted bail to Applicant herein subject to personal bond of Rs. 2 lacs.

Deploring an 'executing court' for its insensitive approach, the Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that the working of our judicial system is painfully slow and sluggish, which creates frustration amongst the people seeking justice. The bench of Justice H. S. Madaan was essentially dealing with a case involving a civil dispute, wherein despite obtaining a decree in its favor in the year 2014, the plaintiffs/decree-holders could not get possession of the encroached portion. The court noted that the defendant in the matter, having lost the litigation in the trial Court as well as in First Appellate Court could successfully stretch the proceedings getting one adjournment after the other on one pretext or the other. The case in brief Essentially, the Plaintiffs filed a civil suit against the defendants (4 in number) seeking possession of land situated in District Hisar (Haryana) said to be in illegal possession of the defendants. After hearing arguments of both sides, Civil Judge (Jr.Divn.), Hansi, vide judgment and decree dated 3.7.2014, allowed the claim of the plaintiffs. Resultantly, the suit filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants was decreed and plaintiffs were found entitled to get possession of the suit land from the defendants. The defendants preferred an appeal before the Court of District Judge, Hisar, which dismissed the same in May 2018. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an execution petition, which kept on getting adjourned as the defendants did not appear in the matter, and therefore, after two years, in August 2022, an ex-parte order was passed in favor of the plaintiffs. Thereafter, an application was filed on behalf of the Judgment Debtors for not handing over the possession of suit land to the decree-holders. Meanwhile, a revision plea was filed by defendant no. 1 before the HC seeking the setting aside of an order dated 8.8.2022 vide which an ex-parte order was granted in favor of the plaintiffs. High Court's observations Taking into account the fact that an execution petition was filed about two years earlier but to date, the possession of the encroached portion could not be got delivered to the decree-holders, the Court remarked thus: ".. (it) speaks volumes for working of our judicial system, which is painfully slow and sluggish creating frustration amongst the people seeking justice. JDs having lost the litigation in the trial Court as well as in First Appellate Court with no stay order being there in their favour have successfully stretched the proceedings getting one adjournment after the other on one pretext or the other and the Executing Court seems to be granting liberal adjournment without being sensitive to the plight of the decree-holders, who are waiting for justice for long more than 10 years. The Executing Court needs to take strong and stringent action in the matter so as to ensure that warrants of possession are executed rather than passing orders in a mechanical manner that warrants of possession had been received back unexecuted, fresh be issued for the next date of hearing. That rather shows the insensitive approach of the Executing Court." Consequently, finding no merit in the civil revision petition, the same was dismissed with the hope that the Executing Court would realize its responsibility and get the decree executed at the earliest.

The Telangana High Court recently held that an educational institution is not covered within the meaning and definition of 'establishment' as defined under Section 2(10) of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, 1988.The Bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice B.

The Telangana High Court recently held that an educational institution is not covered within the meaning and definition of 'establishment' as defined under Section 2(10) of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, 1988. The Bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy took into account the Apex Court and Kerala High Court rulings to arrive at this conclusion. The background of the case The appellant institution is an educational institution and respondent No.3/employee was appointed in the year 1985 as an Attender in the Nutrition Lab Department. She tendered her resignation in December 2009, and service dues were also settled. She preferred an Appeal before the Assistant Labour Commissioner under the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, 1988 stating that she was illegally terminated by the appellant institution. The appellant institution filed a counter-affidavit stating that the employee herself tendered her resignation, her dues have been settled and Appeal deserves to be dismissed.  It was further contended that the Appeal preferred by employee under Section 48(1) of the Shops and Establishments Act, 1988 was not maintainable, in spite of the aforesaid ground, the Appeal was allowed by an Order in July 2019, directing the appellant institution to reinstate the employee with full back wages.  The appellant institution preferred a writ petition stating that the appellant institution is not an establishment and is not covered under the provisions of the Shops and Establishments Act, however, the Single Judge dismissed the writ petition, the same was challenged before the division bench. Court's order At the outset, the Court noted that the institution was governed by the provisions of the Telangana Education Act, 1982 and the said Act provides for redressal of grievance of the nature involved in the instant writ appeal. Further, the Court observed that whether an educational institution falls within the meaning of 'establishment' or not, had been looked into by the Supreme Court in the case of Ruth Soren v. Managing Committee (2001) 2 SCC 115. In that case, keeping in view the definition 'establishment' under the Bihar Shops and Establishments Act, which is similar to the definition under the Telangana Shops and Establishment Act, the Apex Court had held that an educational institution does not fall within the scope of establishment under the Act. The Supreme Court had held that an educational institution may fall within the meaning 'industry', but will certainly not fall within the meaning and term 'establishment', and therefore, the Telangana High Court decided to set aside the Order passed by the Appellate Authority in July 2019 as well as the Order passed by the Single Judge. It may be noted that the Kerala High Court had also taken a similar view in the case of Sree Narayana Educational Institution v. Assistant Labour Officer 2001 (91) FLR 284.  Read order  
"Sanction contemplated under Section 197 is not intended to safeguard illegal acts," the Court added.The Kerala High Court has ruled that sanction stipulated under Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure is not necessary to prosecute police officers in cases of police brutality since such acts are not related in any manner to the discharge of their official duties.Justice Mary Joseph remarked:"...the accused can only be taken to have exercised their authority for committing some illegal... The Kerala High Court has ruled that sanction stipulated under Section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure is not necessary to prosecute police officers in cases of police brutality since such acts are not related in any manner to the discharge of their official duties. Justice Mary Joseph remarked: "...the accused can only be taken to have exercised their authority for committing some illegal acts, under the guise of exercise of lawful discharge of their official duties and therefore are not liable to be afforded with the protection envisaged under Section 197. Sanction contemplated under the above provision is not intended to safeguard illegal acts." The Court added that sanction as a protective measure was incorporated in CrPC to save a public servant acting in bonafide without exceeding the jurisdictional limits and also duly exercising the authority recognized by law: "What is intended by the incorporation of Section 197 in Cr.P.C is an assurance to a public servant that for whatever things bonafide done by him in the lawful exercise of the authority conferred on him, protection would be afforded to him." Background: The petitioners herein were police officers of the Ezhukone Police Station. They were accused of brutally assaulting a man in custody causing inter alia cigarette burns on his tongue, making him unable to speak when produced before the Magistrate.   The injured complainant had narrated gory details of the assault inflicted on him by the accused police officers. The Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kottarakaram found them guilty and passed an order of conviction against them for offences punishable under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The appellate court confirmed this conviction. The revision petition was preferred on the primary contention that despite being public servants cognizance was taken by the trial court and they were prosecuted without getting the sanction from the State Government as contemplated under Section 197 CrPC. and therefore, the process of taking cognizance and conduct of the trial is vitiated.  Both the trial court and the appellant court had taken the view that sanction, as contemplated under Section 197 CrPC, is unwarranted in the case on hand since the acts alleged to have been committed by the accused are not related in any manner to the discharge of their official duties.  Observations: The Court opined that the sanction contemplated under Section 197 was not meant to protect a public servant dealing with the life or personal liberty of a man out of the purview of law or procedure established by law. Therefore, a policeman had to act within the limits of the legal domain recognized by the Code or any other enactments.  "For the mere reason that the Policemen arrived there in a Departmental vehicle during hours of their official duty, and took the complainant along with them to the Police Station, it cannot be said that, they were discharging their official duties. There must be some legal basis while depriving the personal liberty of a person, since it being the mandate of our Constitution under Article 21 that a person's life or liberty shall not only be curtailed or abridged without the support of a procedure established by law." The Court further noted that the accused cannot take the advantage of Section 197 after committing mischievous acts under the guise of lawful discharge of official duties.  "The fact that the incident occurred within the Police Station and during the course of discharge of official duty by the Policemen will not legalise it if it turns out as an exercise of excess power by them for illegal gain." Therefore, the Bench held that sanction is absolutely unwarranted in the context of taking cognizance of the offence against the accused and prosecuting them. "This Court ... was convinced that the injuries inflicted were of barbarous nature and unwarranted by the circumstances that exist at the relevant time, for discharging the official duty by them as Policemen. The context being so, sanction, as contemplated under Section 197 CrPC, cannot be a precondition for taking cognizance of the offences against the accused and for prosecuting them. The trial court undoubtedly is justified in holding so and this Court finds no reason to interfere with that finding." In the light of the foregoing discussions, the High Court held that the trial and the appellate courts were not in error and were perfectly justified in finding the accused guilty for the offences under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC, convicting them and imposing punishments on them for those by the impugned judgment. Accordingly, the revision petitions were dismissed.  Senior Advocate K Gopalakrishna Kurup and Advocate S. Rajeev appeared for the petitioners in the matter while Public Prosecutor E.C. Bineesh represented the State.  Case Title: D. Rajagopal v. Ayyappan & Anr. and connected matter  
The Kerala High Court on Thursday observed that when the sale of liquor is prohibited for a few days with the object of maintaining peace, preserving public order and for public good, commercial interests takes a back seat, even if it means experiencing a disruption in sales. A division bench comprising Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice C. Jayachandran was hearing a batch of appeals and writ petitions filed challenging the order of the lower court that refused to stay the orders by two District Collectors that prohibited FL3 licensees and licensed toddy shops from selling liquor for a few days around three different locations where religious festivals were being held.   On addressing the concerns of the appellant about the huge losses they have to incur due to such bans, the court said:  “We quite understand that the licensees have made substantial investments to carry on liquor vending, both foreign liquor and toddy. The disruption of sales for one or two days especially with the object of maintaining peace, for public good and preservation of public order, relegates commercial considerations to the back seat”   The impugned orders relate to ban on sale of liquor around area of 'Kumbhathiruvathira’ festival in Kadakkal Devi Temple in Kollam and around 'Manappullikkavu Vela' and 'Pattambi Nercha' religious festivals in Palakkad.  It was argued by the FL3 licensee appellants that such a blanket ban would affect them severely as they have invested significant amounts of money to obtain FL3 licenses, and any sudden restrictions even for a single day would greatly harm their financial interests. It was also argued that the licencees being classified hotels, have also made considerable investments in infrastructure and for promoting tourism.  It was also contented by the appellants that under Section 54 of the Kerala Abkari Act (Closing of shop for the sake of public peace) a notice is required to be served and an opportunity of hearing is to be granted to the licencees. The court while disagreeing with this view point, observed that:  “We also notice from S.54 that the notice does not necessarily speak of an opportunity for hearing. The notice in writing is only insofar as notice to the licensee to close down a shop, in which intoxicating liquor or drug is sold, for the purpose of preservation of public peace, which notice is only to enable the licensee to arrange his affairs accordingly. In fact, the licensee of a liquor shop has absolutely no say in the preservation of public peace and a hearing conducted would be futile since they cannot instruct the District Administration as to how the law-and-order situation within their jurisdictional limits is to be maintained peaceful”   It was also the case of the appellants that such a ban in a limited area around the religious festivals does not prevent a person from consuming liquor from outside the prohibited zones and entering the festivals. The court in this regard observed:  “The contention raised by the appellants that any person could still come intoxicated to the festival, does not permit us to digress from the immediate effects of consumption of liquor, especially when it is readily available at the spot and the deleterious consequences on the unsuspecting public, if the intoxicated person or persons turn violent and engage in criminal activities.”  The Senior Government Pleader appearing for the state submitted that the orders were issued due to a genuine concern that people of various backgrounds and religions would converge at the festival grounds and many a times violence breaks out between people which is often fuelled by alcohol or drug consumption and disrupts the festivities. Dismissing the writ petitions and appeals and upholding the liquor ban, the court held that: “festivities in all the three sites have a profusion of pyrotechnics, musical ensemble, colourful displays on caparisoned elephants, exhibitions, fares and the like, providing sufficient entertainment without being further enthused and infused with the toxicity of liquor. True, there could still be drunkenness and brawls resulting from that; but there would be sufficient mitigation and reduced instances, if proximate access to liquor is prohibited.” Case Title: Hotel Hillway Park V State of Kerala & Others and connected cases  
The Orissa High Court has held that charge under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code cannot be quashed in exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC against a husband merely because Family Court while deciding an application for maintenance under Section 125 CrPC has given a finding that she is not his wife.  While refusing to quash an order taking cognizance under Section 498-A against the petitioner, Justice Gourishankar Satapathy said:  "…it would not be proper for a Court to undertake hair splitting scrutiny of materials on record in a proceeding under section 482 of Cr.P.C. to conclude that the proceeding under section 498-A of IPC is not maintainable for want of valid marriage which would not only encourage harassment of women but also demoralizes them."  Brief Facts  An FIR was registered against the accused-petitioner for commission of offences punishable under sections 498(A)/323/506/34 IPC r/w 4 of Dowry Prevention Act. Subsequently, a charge-sheet was also filed against him. After perusing the materials and documents produced by the investigating officer and finding prima facie case, the Magistrate Court, by the impugned order, took cognizance and issued process. Being aggrieved by the order, the petitioner approached the High Court.  Contentions of the Petitioner  Anirudha Das, counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Family Court, while deciding an application under Section 125 CrPC, has come to a finding that the woman is not the wife of the petitioner. Thus, the counsel argued that in absence of a valid marriage, she cannot maintain a criminal proceeding for offence under Section 498-A of IPC.   He further submitted that to proceed against a person under Section 498-A, IPC, there must be a legal relationship of husband and wife. However, that not being so in this case, the criminal proceeding against the petitioner is bad in the eyes of law. To support his contentions, he placed reliance on the decisions in Reema Aggrawal v. Anupam & Anr. and Unnikrishnan @ Chandu v. State of Kerala, (2017) SCC OnLine Ker 12064.  Contentions of the Respondent  Sailaza Nandan Das, counsel for the State relied upon the decision in A. Subash Babu v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr., to submit that the law declared in Reema Aggrawal is binding on all Courts and the petitioner being the husband of the woman cannot take the plea that the marriage was invalid.   He further submitted that husband contracting second marriage during the subsistence of earlier marriage can be charged for offence under section 498-A of IPC and merely because a judgment is rendered by the Family Court in proceeding under section 125 of CrPC, the Court by itself cannot declare the status of the woman as 'concubine' of the petitioner.  Court's Observations  After examining the rival contentions, the Court held that the Family Court could not have given a finding on the validity of marriage while deciding an application for maintenance under Section 125 CrPC, as the same can only be done through a civil proceeding after assessing evidence and pleadings on record.  "It is true that learned Judge, Family Court has concluded by his judgment in Cr.P. No. 64 of 2016 which is admittedly a proceeding U/S 125 of Cr.P.C. that the O.P. No.2 (Petitioner therein) cannot be treated as the wife of Petitioner (O.P. therein) but such conclusion can be arrived at in a civil proceeding to declare the status of a woman as such, if the person claiming for such declaration makes out a case for the relief on assessment of evidence and pleadings on record, but the learned Judge, Family Court herein at best could have concluded while refusing to grant maintenance by his judgment that the Petitioner could not establish her relationship with O.P. as husband and wife."  The Court further observed that the plea of 'no marriage' was advanced by the petitioner in the course of hearing of the application before the High Court under Section 482, Cr.P.C. However, it added that the court is not sitting over a case in exercise of original jurisdiction to decide the status of the parties by way of declaration which can only be done by a Civil Court. It further said: "It is also extremely unfair and harsh to a woman who claims herself to be wife of a person by entering into a marital relationship and later on become a victim of desertion by the said person taking plea of absence of a valid marriage. The obvious objective of enacting offence under section 498-A of IPC is to secure the prevention of harassment to a woman from cruelty meted out to her by husband or his relatives." Consequently, after taking into consideration the uncontroverted allegation mentioned in the FIR and statement of witnesses together with other documents collected in the course of investigation, the Court concluded that there are prima facie materials for proceeding against the petitioner for offences alleged against him. "The learned Court of S.D.J.M., Nabarangpur has not committed any illegality in taking cognizance of offences by the impugned order which cannot be interfered by this Court in exercise of power of inherent jurisdiction as the same has been passed on proper legal scrutiny of materials on record," the court said, while dismissing the plea.

The Gujarat High Court has held that once a customer acts on the basis of offer made by a Bank under its One Time Settlement scheme, the principle of promissory estoppel applies and the latter is estopped from acting to the detriment of the former. "It is clear that the principle of promissory estoppel applies. The bank by its conduct of offering an OTS settlement intended to create legal relations which the petitioners had acted upon in light of the promise made and paid the amount on or before 30th of December 2017. This action was apparently accepted in principle by the bank as not only for the title clearance certificate but valuation reports letters were written by by the bank to the advocates and the valuers. The amounts were paid and accepted by the bank and once the petitioners had acted upon on the promise set out by the bank, the bank cannot be allowed to go back on its proposal on the basis of a letter dated 28th August 2018 stating that the scheme of OTS was not applicable as the cases of the petitioners was reported as fraud." It thus directed the State Bank of India (Respondent) to issue a no due certificate to the Petitioner-Company and further release the mortgage documents in its custody for the release of the properties in question. The High Court further directed that the Bank withdraw all pending proceedings against the Petitioners under the SARFAESI Act before the competent authorities. While admitting the petition of the Company, Justice Biren Vaishnav applied the principle of Promissory Estoppel:  "The act on behalf of the bank therefore in not releasing the title documents, not issuing of a no due certificate and not withdrawing the pending legal actions against the petitioners is arbitrary and violates the constitutional guarantee enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution of India as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Central Bank of India versus Devi Ispat (2010) 11 SCC 186."  The Single Judge Bench made this observation in the context of an Art 226 petition seeking the issuance of a no-due certificate to the Petitioners and further release of the charge in its favour with Statutory Authorities such as the Registrar of Companies, Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India, Land Revenue Authorities or any other authority. It was further sought that the proceedings pending against the Company under Sec 14 of the SARFAESI Act be declared illegal, null and void ab initio.  The Petitioner herein had received a letter from the Respondent-Bank offering a One Time Settlement (OTS) of outstanding dues to the tune of Rs. 12, 34, 54,566 by a payment of Rs. 9,90,58,133. The Bank offered that if this amount was paid before 31st December 2017, the Petitioners would be eligible for an additional incentive of 10% over the OTS amount. The Petitioner indicated in October 2017 that it would remit the amount by the due date but the Bank should release the documents and give a no due certificate. However, the same was not released despite full payment. The Bank thereafter sent a letter in August 2018 reporting the Petitioners as fraud to the RBI for some transactions in 2016 and therefore, the Petitioners were deemed unentitled to the benefits of OTS. However, the Petitioners were not returned the settlement money, either.   The Petitioners primarily contested that the principle of promissory estoppel applied in the instant case since the Bank could not have cancelled the OTS letter when it had not informed the case as fraud. The Bank's action of not releasing the title papers and issuing a no-due certificate and clearing the charges of the bank and not withdrawing the legal action against the Petitioners was bad in law. The Bank had filed an application under Sec 14 of the SARFAESI Act which had to be withdrawn. Reliance was placed on Gujarat State Financial Corporation vs. Lotus Hotels Private Limited reported in AIR 1983 SC 848 for bringing home the argument on estopping the bank from backing out.  Per contra, the Respondent Bank contested that the instant petition was not maintainable since there was an alternative remedy available to the Petitioners under the SARFAESI Act of approaching the Debt Recovery Tribunal. Further, reference was made to Clause 2.1 of the OTS Scheme to indicate that cases reported as fraud will not be eligible. The Company had committed fraud by selling the collateral mortgage securities without permission or obtaining an NOC from the Bank and did not deposit the sale proceeds with the Bank also. Thus, the OTS Scheme was withdrawn.  Justice Vaishnav observed, "When the entire amount was paid pursuant to the OTS settlement, the bank could not have cancelled the settlement vide its letter dated 28.08.2018 stating that as the case of the petitioners was reported as fraud, the petitioners were not entitled to the benefits of ATS. In light of the decision in the case of Lotus Hotel (Supra), it is clear that the principle of promissory estoppel applies."  Accordingly, the petition was allowed and the related Special Civil Application was also disposed of.

The Gauhati High Court recently directed a Secondary Education Department to process the pensionary benefits of a person who was denied the same on the ground that he did not have the necessary qualification at the time of appointment.  Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua observed that there was no departmental enquiry into the same during his tenure and that the cause of action of the misconduct occurred in 1988.   "In the instant case, records reveal that neither there was any departmental proceeding nor the cause of action of the misconduct is within the period of four years from which a departmental proceeding can be initiated. Admittedly, the cause of action took place in the year 1988 itself when the petitioner entered service without having the necessary qualification. From such point of view, we are of the view that the pensionary benefits of the petitioner cannot be now withheld by invoking the proviso to Rule 21 of the Assam Services (Pension) Rules, 1969."  The petitioner was appointed as an Assistant Teacher under the Elementary Education Department of Government of Assam on 25.11.1988 and he retired from service as an Assistant Teacher of Kacharihat Girls' High School on 31.08.2019. The total length of service rendered by the petitioner is stated to be 30 years and 279 days.  The Department denied him pensionary benefits citing that he did not pass the HSLC examination or any other equivalent examination. The departmental authorities took the view that it could not be ascertained as to whether the petitioner was in a pensionable service. Aggrieved by the denial of the pensionary benefits after retirement, the petitioner moved the Court.   The Court recorded that a reading of Rule 21(1) of the Assam Services (Pension) Rules provides that the Governor of Assam reserves to himself the right of withholding or withdrawing a pension, whether permanently or for a specified period if in the departmental or judicial proceeding the pensioner is found guilty of grave misconduct for negligence during the period of his service.   In other words, any withholding of the pensioner benefits would have to satisfy the conditions precedent of there being an order in a departmental or judicial proceeding which may indicate that the pensioner is found guilty of grave misconduct or negligence.  Further, the proviso (b)(ii) under Rule 21 of Assam Services (Pension) Rules, 1969 provides that the departmental proceeding, if not instituted while the person concerned was in service shall not be in respect of any event which took place more than four years before such institution of a departmental proceeding.  The Court also perused the petitioner's record and noted that it revealed that neither there was any departmental proceeding nor the cause of action of the misconduct is within the period of four years from which a departmental proceeding can be initiated.  "In the instant case, even if it is accepted that the petitioner did not have the necessary qualification at the time of his initial appointment in the year 1988, a conclusion of misconduct thereof would have to be arrived in a departmental proceeding and further the cause of action for such misconduct would have to be within a period of four years from the initiation of the departmental proceeding."Court said  The Court recorded that the cause of action took place back in 1988 itself when the petitioner entered service without having the necessary qualification. Therefore, it was of the view that the petitioner is entitled to pensionary benefits and the writ was allowed accordingly.

'Non-payment of dues, the delays in project completion, and not paying transit rent for months together speaks to an inherent, and constantly growing, social injustice'In a judgement that lays bare the reality of 'redevelopment' in Mumbai, the Bombay High court has held that even the slightest delay in project completion or payment in rent is sufficient to warrant the termination of a developer's contact.  A single bench of Justice Gautam Patel has observed that in matters of redevelopment, which are in the realm of private law, there is no such thing as 'substantial compliance.'  The slightest delay in project completion, unless specifically accepted by the society, and even one single default in payment of transit rent or other dues is actually sufficient to warrant a termination. There is no such thing in these matters as 'substantial compliance'. That is not the principle of obligations in the realm of private law.  The Case  The court was hearing a petition by Rajawadi Arunodaya Co-op Housing Society Ltd. from Ghatkopar (east) under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act for interim reliefs before the arbitral proceedings begin, regarding a six-year delay in completion of the project and non-payment of rent by developer Value Projects Pvt Ltd.   The original building with 20 residential and seven commercial units was built before 1985 on 1000 sq meters of land. The Society entered into a deed of redevelopment on April 5, 2013, and handed over vacant possession of their flats in 2015. However, a severe default in rent and contractual obligation by the developer, including the creation of third-party rights compelled them to terminate the contract in 2019 and approach the High Court, last year.   Justice Patel has granted a mandatory injunction to the society and ordered the developer to hand over peaceful possession of the property by April 19, appointed a Court Receiver who remain in symbolic possession until completion of the project and also appointed an arbitrator to decide the disputes between the society and developer arising out of the 2013 contract.   The developer's petition for interim reliefs, a status-quo so that his investment remained protected, was dismissed. "This order is not a final determination of the developer's final contentions or claims. It may in arbitration seek suitable reliefs," Justice Patel held.  Observations  Justice Patel observed that re-development involves a very real issue of human displacement and an associated trauma caused to an entire community by the delay in project completion. Where people who have lived together for generations suddenly lose contact forever.   This is what has been lost in translation. This is what delayed redevelopment projects do not begin to let us understand. There is a very real human tragedy unfolding in case after case, and it is tearing apart the social fabric of this city. It is all very easy to say in a Court of law that "arrears of transit rent" have not been paid. What does this actually mean? Digits and commas on a page in a lawsuit do not let us comprehend the terrifying reality of what that non-payment of rent month after month after month must mean to ordinary middle-income people."  Describing a typical middle-class community, with its open-doors and families celebrating festivals together, Justice Patel observes that "development" in a dryly-worded contract, does not tell us what has happened — that this community has been literally splintered and torn apart. The contact that has persisted through generations has almost certainly been lost.  This city is really nothing but an agglomeration of these communities [Maharashtrian, Gujarati, Tamil, Kannada, Parsi or otherwise] working together.  He ruled that the balance of convenience would lie in the society's favour, as a development project would be a gamble for a developer but a matter of survival for a society.   The hardship to the members is real and immediate; the so-called hardship to the Developers is notional. When it spent in the project, this was no altruism or charity…The Developer gambled on the project. Receiving monthly rent is not a sop, not a matter of 'convenience'. It is a matter of survival. Therefore, the non-payment of dues, the delays in project completion, and not paying transit rent for months together speaks to an inherent, and constantly growing, social injustice.  Justice Patel said that there are different categories in re-development cases. However, in a case where the developer has left the job mid-way and the society comes to court for termination, the developer must bring forward a proposal covering, (i) accumulated arrears of transit rent and other dues; (ii) the obligation to pay ongoing transit rent until possession with an occupation certificate; (iii) payment of statutory and corporation dues, including property tax and (iv) a demonstration of the financial means to bring the project to completion.  And in its absence, be ready for termination of the contract, ejectment from site and liability to pay all the accumulated debts.   Justice Patel noted the case of Gopi Gorwani v Ideal Cooperative Housing Society Ltd & Ors, 2013 SCC OnLine Bom 1967, where it was held that "Loss of faith and confidence on account of contractual violations and breaches by a developer are sufficient grounds to find for the society and against the developer."  The Society was represented by advocate Mayur Khandeparkar, with Tushar Gujjar, instructed by Solicis Lex. The developer was represented by advocate Rohaan Shah, with Paresh Shah, & Srisabari Rajan, instructed by Shah & SanghaviClick Hear To Download/Read Petition

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently ruled that only an assertion that the corpus has been abducted by some unknown miscreants, is not sufficient to seek issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. The Bench of Justice S. A. Dharmadhikari further held that the condition precedent for instituting a writ of habeas corpus is that the person for whose release, the writ of habeas corpus is sought must be in detention and he must be under detention by the Authorities or by any private individual. The case in brief A Habeas corpus writ plea was instituted before the High Court by one Chhaya Gurjar submitting that certain miscreants have abducted her sister-in-law (namely Aarti), as well as, Aarti's daughter Kajal from the campus of High Court. Further, it was contended that when mother-in-law of corpus Aarti had come to High Court in connection with some case, the accused persons abducted Aarti and her daughter Kajal.  Lastly, it was alleged in the plea that the respondent-Authorities are having all the information in respect of both of them, but are not providing any information. It was also alleged that despite lodging a missing person report at Police Station, to date no action had been taken in that behalf. On the other hand, the Government pleader submitted that the writ of habeas corpus can't be issued in this matter as there is no allegation that the corpus and her daughter are in illegal confinement of any private respondent. It was also submitted that the Petitioner had not impleaded any suspect as party respondent. Court's observations  The Court noted that the controversy in the instant matter was regarding whether a writ of habeas corpus can be issued against an unknown abductor in respect of a missing person? At the outset, the Court said that under the writ of habeas corpus, the fundamental right and liberty is to be protected, only if there is an illegal detention, either by State or by a private individual. Importantly, stressing that in such matters, there must be illegal detention or at least there must be some substantiated grounds regarding suspicion, the Court further remarked thus: "In the absence of any such contention, no habeas corpus petition can be entertained under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Habeas Corpus is a writ in the nature of an order calling upon the person who has detained another to produce the latter before the Court, in order to let the Court know on what ground he has been confined and to set him free if there is no legal jurisdiction for the imprisonment." Lastly, referring to various judgments of the Apex Court, the Court concluded thus: "The only assertion that the corpus have been abducted by some unknown miscreants, is not sufficient to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court for issuance of writ of habeas corpus, which though a writ of right, is not a writ of course." The petition was accordingly, dismissed, however, this Court directed the respondents/Police Authorities to bring the investigation pursuant to the missing person report to its logical end, as expeditiously as possible. In related news, the Gauhati High Court recently held that missing person cases would not come within the ambit of a habeas corpus petition (without strong suspicion of illegal detention), but such cases are required to be registered under the regular provisions of the Indian Penal Code.

The Allahabad High Court has granted anticipatory bail to former Union minister Chinmayanand Saraswati in connection with the Shahjahanpur Rape Case 2011 after the state did not oppose his bail plea. In fact, the Counsel for the complainant filed a counter affidavit stating that the complainant has no objection, whatsoever, if Chinmayanand is enlarged on anticipatory bail. #JustIn | Chinmayanand Saraswati Granted Anticipatory Bail by the #AllahabadHighCourt in the Shahjahanpur Rape Case 2011 pic.twitter.com/nCFxzl4JQZ— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) February 6, 2023  Taking into account the stand of the complainant and state, the bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh went ahead to grant him anticipatory bail by confirming its earlier order of December 19, 2022, wherein he was granted interim anticipatory bail till February 6. It may be recalled that while granting him interim anticipatory bail on December 19, the Court had issued notices to the victim and the State government to file a reply in this matter within four weeks. Senior Advocate Anoop Trivedi appeared for Saraswati. Pursuant to Court’s order, the Complainant filed an affidavit stating that she has no objection if he is granted anticipatory bail. Significantly, the complainant has also informed the Court that she had no objection even if the state decides to withdraw from prosecution as she has no interest in further prosecuting the aforesaid case. On the other hand, the state counsels also submitted that the state itself had taken a decision to withdraw from prosecution and had granted permission to the Public Prosecutor to move an application under Section 321 Cr.P.C. (which was rejected by the trial court and later on, the order of the trial court was upheld by the HC) and, therefore, it was further submitted that the State is not opposing to grant the anticipatory bail to the accused-applicant. In view of these submissions, the Court granted him the relief  The case against Saraswati  It may be noted that Chinmayanand was booked in this case after a woman who had spent 11 years at his ashram accused him of committing rape against her. The Police have already filed a chargesheet in the case under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation). As per the allegations leveled by the complainant/victim in this case, Saraswati established a physical relationship with her perforce, administering some intoxicants in her food and thereafter brutally ravishing her. Allegedly, Swami also took obscene audio-visual videos and porn photographs, and during this process, she was impregnated twice and for the first time at Bareilly and for the second time at Lucknow, she was got aborted. Not only this, when she was pregnant, she was assaulted mercilessly by the applicant's goons. Earlier, on September 30, the Allahabad High Court had upheld the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Shahjahanpur refusing to allow the state government's application seeking withdrawal of the rape case against former Union minister Chinmayanand Saraswati. The Court had also asked him to surrender before the trial court by October 30, this period was extended till November 30 by the Supreme Court. Now moving to the High Court, his counsel argued that since the applicant was given a protective order during the period of investigation, now, he may be granted anticipatory bail till the conclusion of the trial as he is an old and infirm person aged about 75 years having several sicknesses. It was also argued that though he was given time till November 30 to surrender and apply for bail, however, the same would not in any manner restrict him and bind him for not exploring his remedy available under law under Section 438 Cr.P.C. for anticipatory bail. Taking into account the submissions of the counsels for both parties, the Court granted him relief till February 6. 
The Supreme Court recently held that a notification issued under the Minimum Wages Act can only be a guiding factor in determining the income of the deceased in a motor accident claims case. When there is positive evidence regarding the income, reliance cannot be placed on minimum wages notification. In this case, the Supreme Court was considering an appeal filed by the claimants against a judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which reduced the compensation awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal. The deceased was a 25 year old man, who was earning livelihood as a contractor. Although the claimed monthly income was Rs. 50,000/-, the Tribunal reckoned Rs 25,000 as the monthly income. The Tribunal took into account factors such as the deceased was paying monthly instalment of Rs.11,550/- towards the loan of a tractor purchased by him from 10.03.2014 onwards and the entire loan liability was discharged by 24.03.2015 with payment being made even after his death. Keeping in mind the rate at which EMI was being paid, the Tribunal held that the deceased must be earning at least Rs.25,000/- per month prior to his death in the accident. The High Court came to the conclusion that the mere fact that the deceased had paid instalments of the loan could not itself be an evidence that the money actually represented his income or can form the basis for assessment of income of the deceased at Rs.25,000/- per month. Taking into consideration the Notification issued by the State of Haryana, fixing minimum wage at the relevant time, the High Court assessed the income of the deceased at Rs.7,000/- per month, and on this premise, the compensation was reduced. The Supreme Court disapproved the High Court's verdict and observed that the Tribunal had followed a just and reasonable approach. "In our considered view, the Tribunal's approach is quite justified in law as well as on facts. In the summary proceedings where the approach of the Tribunal's determination must be in conformity with the object of the welfare legislation, it was rightly held that the monthly income of the deceased could not be less than Rs.25,000/-. The reason assigned by the High Court to reduce the monthly income of the deceased is totally cryptic and has no rationale" The bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and MM Sundresh further stated : "The Notification of Minimum Wages Act can be a guiding factor only in a case where there is no clue available to evaluate monthly income of the deceased. Where positive evidence has been led, no reliance on the Notification could be placed, particularly when it was nobody's case that the deceased was a labourer as presumed by the High Court" Accordingly, the appeal was allowed by restoring the order of the Tribunal. Case Title : Gurpreet Kaur and others versus United India Insurance Company and others Motor Accident Claims - Motor Vehicles Act 1988 - Section 168 - The Notification of Minimum Wages Act can be a guiding factor only in a case where there is no clue available to evaluate monthly income of the deceased. Where positive evidence has been led, no reliance on the Notification could be placed, particularly when it was nobody's case that the deceased was a labourer as presumed by the High Court-Para 9     
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Friday observed that the Principal Sessions Judge of a district has no jurisdiction to withdraw/recall a case, in which trial/hearing has commenced before an Additional Sessions Judge as provided in Section 409(2) of CrPC.  The observations were made by Justice M A Chowdhary while hearing a plea through the medium of which the petitioner sought transfer of two cases from the court of Principal District & Sessions Judge Srinagar to any other court of competent jurisdiction at Srinagar.  Counsel appearing for the petitioner, argued that from the conduct of the case by the appellate court, firstly, by taking up the case without showing in the Cause List and passing orders when the matter had not been heard and, secondly, that the appeal before another Sessions Court was recalled, despite the fact that the court had already issued notice in the matter, to which the Principal Sessions Judge was not competent, have given the impression to the petitioner that he shall not get fair trial of the case before that court.  The facts in the instant case were that a complaint was filed by respondent in terms of Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 before the court of Magistrate Srinagar, who vide order dated 25.07.2022, directed the petitioner herein to pay maintenance of Rs.15,000/- per month to the respondent.  Aggrieved of this order, petitioner herein filed an appeal under Section 29 of D.V.Act before the court of Principal District & Sessions Judge Srinagar, which was transferred to the court of 2nd Additional District Judge Srinagar for adjudication. Respondent No.1 also aggrieved of the same order dated 25.07.2022 passed by Magistrate filed an appeal under Section 29 of D.V.Act, against the petitioner and Mrs. Tahira Begum, who was arrayed as proforma respondent, before the court of Principal Sessions Judge Srinagar, which was retained by him in his own court.  Subsequently the Principal Sessions Judge Srinagar also recalled the appeal assigned to the court of 2nd Additional Sessions Judge. It was inter alia because of this that the petitioner sought the transfer of the cases to any other appropriate court.  The moot question that sought Adjudication from the bench was as to whether the Principal Sessions Judge, once assigning the case to the court of Additional Sessions Judge, when the notice had already been issued in the matter, is competent or having jurisdiction, to withdraw the case from that court.  Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Chowdhary held that under Section 409 of CrPC, the Sessions Judge is devoid of power to recall those cases of which trial or hearing has began before the court of Additional Sessions Judge. It observed:  "Hearing in the appeal starts with the issuance of notice before the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge Srinagar, therefore, learned Principal Sessions Judge Srinagar was not having any power or jurisdiction to withdraw or recall the appeal assigned to the court of learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge Srinagar, therefore, recalling of the order which has been made the basis for transfer of this case, in the considered opinion of this Court has been passed without jurisdiction by the learned Principal Sessions Judge Srinagar", the bench underscored.  Buttressing the said position of law the bench placed reliance on a Judgement of J&K&L High Court in Raghunandan Bakshi & Anr. Vs. Bidi Chand reported as 1997 KLJ 98 wherein J&K&L High Court observed,  "Recalling of the case by the Sessions Judge has been authorised under the provisions of Section 528 Cr.P.C. (akin to Section 409 of Central CrPC extended to the UTs of J&K and Ladakh) from the Court of Additional Sessions Judge only in case of trial of cases or in respect of appeals, but before such trial begins or hearing of the appeal begins. In case the learned Additional Sessions Judge starts with the trial of the case or hearing of the appeal, the Sessions Judge is devoid of the power of recalling those cases i.e. trial case and appeal case before him".  For the foregoing reasons the transfer petition was allowed by the bench.  Case Title : Mehboob Ul Hussain Vs Jhasra Parvaiz          
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that conditions imposed by the court Section 439(1)(a) CrPC while granting bail cannot by any stretch of imagination be construed to mean that accused person is in custody so as to claim the computation of such period in reckoning the period of 180 days of detention to acquire the statutory right of default bail under proviso... The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that conditions imposed by the court Section 439(1)(a) CrPC while granting bail cannot by any stretch of imagination be construed to mean that accused person is in custody so as to claim the computation of such period in reckoning the period of 180 days of detention to acquire the statutory right of default bail under proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167 CrPC read with Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act. The observations were made by a bench of Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the order passed by Principal Sessions Judge, Srinagar, whereby the petitioner's application for grant of default bail had been dismissed. The primary ground on which the petitioner challenged his bail rejection by the District Judge Srinagar was that the period during which he was released on interim bail should be treated as period under custody for the purpose of counting the total period for which the petitioner had been in custody, whereafter his plea for grant of default bail should be considered. The petitioner further contended that the Sessions Judge had fallen into an error by excluding the period during which the petitioner was released on interim bail. The petitioner argued that the custody of an accused released on bail is deemed to be the custody of the Court and, as such, the whole period, without excluding the period during which the petitioner was on interim bail has to be taken into account while considering his application for grant of default bail.  Perusal of the record revealed the petitioner had moved an application for grant of default bail before the Principal Sessions Judge, Srinagar, on 04.08.2021, contending therein that the investigating agency had failed to produce the charge sheet against him despite lapse of 180 days and, as such, he  is entitled to compulsive bail. Record further revealed that the Sessions Judge, after considering the matter came to the conclusion that even though the charge sheet was not produced by the investigating agency within the stipulated period of 180 days from the date of arrest of the petitioner, yet because the petitioner was on interim bail with effect from 24.05.2021 to 08.07.2021, as such, after excluding the said period, the petitioner had been in custody only for 140 days, thus was not entitled to grant of default bail. It was this order which was being impugned by the petitioner before the bench.  Deciding the matter in controversy Justice Dhar observed that a Court while exercising the discretion of granting bail even for a limited period imposes conditions under Section 439(1)(a), then an accused is released from custody on execution of bonds but imposition of such conditions cannot by any stretch of imagination be construed to mean that an accused person is in custody. "By imposition of such conditions, the physical custody of the accused does not vest with the Court as his movement is not in any way restricted. It cannot be stated that he was in physical custody of the Court so as to claim the computation of such period in reckoning the period of 180 days of detention to acquire the statutory right under proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167 Cr. P. C read with Section 36A(4) of the NDPS Act", Justice Dhar explained. Expounding further the bench also placed reliance on a Judgement of the Supreme Court in Gautam Navlakha vs. National Investigation Agency, 2021 wherein SC observed,  "Broken periods of custody have to be counted while computing the total period of custody undergone by an accused for the purpose of considering his default bail plea, which in other words means that the period during which an accused has not been in custody or has been enlarged on bail cannot be computed while  calculating the period of custody for the purposes of considering the default bail plea".  While dismissing the petition the bench upheld the order of bail rejection by the Principal District and Sessions Judge Srinagar and thereby maintained the petitioner in the instant case cannot be treated to be in detention or custody for the period he was released on temporary bail.

The Bombay High Court has rejected a review application filed by three accused in the Bhima Koregaon – Elgar Parishad Case seeking bail and factual corrections in the order refusing them default bail.  The court disposed of a review application filed by the three, seeking factual corrections in the order refusing them default bail and subsequently release.  A division bench led by Justice SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar had reserved the plea for orders on March 22, 2022. Today, it pronounced the operative portion of the order stating, "No case for exercise of review jurisdiction is made out. A point which was not urged, is impermissible to be reviewed."  On December 1, 2021, the High Court denied default bail to the petitioners and five of their co-accused on the ground that they had not filed their default bail applications within the stipulated period, which is after 60 days of their arrest and before filing of the charge sheet.   The same bench held that even though the Pune Sessions Judge extended their detention after 60 days without jurisdiction, since he was not a special judge under the NIA Act, they were not entitled to relief. Co-accused Sudha Bharadwaj was, however, granted bail in the same order.  All the eight who were denied relief claimed that denial of bail was on account of a factual error; as just like Bharadwaj, they had also filed default bail applications in the trial could within the stipulated period.  Gonsalves, Rao and Ferreira claimed they applied for default bail on November 30, 2018, just four days after Bharadwaj's application. In the plea filed through Advocate R Sathyanarayanan they contended that the Pune Sessions Court rejected their default bail applications and Bharadwaj's default bail plea in a common order on November 6, 2019. They pointed out that the November 6, 2019 order was set aside by the High Court while granting bail to Bharadwaj.  Finally the application states that the High Court has plenary powers to correct such factual errors.  "If such power of correcting its own record is denied to the High Court, when it notices the apparent errors its consequence is that the superior status of the High Court will dwindle down. Therefore, it is only proper to think that the plenary powers of the High Court would include the power of review relating to errors apparent on the face of the record," the accused said in their application.   However, the bench asked them to point out if this was brought to the court's notice when their applications were being heard.   Opposing the application the National Investigating Agency cited the embargo on a bench under Section 362 of CrPC to alter or review judgements once a petition is decided on merits.  Advocate Sandesh Patil for NIA, said that the accused directly wanted the final observation altered, which was made final after due verification of record. "Thus, the applicants/accused persons ought not to crave. any relief that is subjected to judicial proceedings that to be exercised to alter or review the order which expressly barred by the Code of Criminal Procedure," the reply read.  The agency argued that the accused should have approached the Supreme Court in appeal instead of the High Court.  Case   The National Investigation Agency booked 16 civil liberties activists under sections 121, 121A, 124A, 153A, 505(1)(b), 117, 120b r/w 34 of the IPC and sections 13,16,17,18,18-B,20,38,39 and 40 of the UAPA. Father Stan Swamy, the 16th accused to be arrested, passed away on July 5 2021, ahead of his bail hearing.   The NIA has accused them of a plot to overthrow the Government and of being members of front organisations of the banned CPI(Maoists).   The agency has accused the activists for furthering the CPI(Maoist) agenda and causing the caste violence at the Bhima Koregaon war memorial on January 1, 2018, through the Elgar Parishad event held a day prior.   However, the arrested activists have said that incriminating material was planted on Gadling and co-accused researcher Rona Wilson's laptop, based on an independent US-based forensic analysis report.  Apart from Bharadwaj and Rao (granted bail on medical grounds), all the accused are still in prison.  As for Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen and Mahesh Raut, they are pursing their default bail pleas filed on September 26, 2018, i.e. 90 days after their arrest on July 6 and before the first charge sheet against them was submitted on November 15, 2018. They have sought for the special court to decide these applications now.    
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently reiterated that merely because Section 37 of the NDPS Act comes into play where commercial quantity of contraband is involved, it does not mean that the accused cannot be entitled to bail whatever may be the circumstances that may be borne out from the record.  Elaborating on the rigours prescribed under Section 37 NDPS Act, Justice Puneet Gupta observed that 'reasonable grounds' must be shown for believing that the accused is not guilty of offence under Section 19 or Section 24 or Section 27 and also for offences involving commercial quantity and is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. "The mere severity of punishment under Section 8/22/29 NDPS Act should not weigh with the court if the circumstances placed on record do otherwise make out a case for bail in favour of the accused." The bench was hearing a plea wherein the petitioner-accused sought bail in the complaint filed against him for offences under Section 8/22/29 NDPS Act.  The counsel appearing for the petitioner argued that except for the so called statement of the petitioner and the other accused Muzaffar Ahmed from whom the drug has been allegedly recovered by the respondent, there is no other evidence which connects the accused with the commission of offence. It was asserted that the statement of the petitioner recorded in terms of Section 67 of the NDPS Act has no legal force, therefore the respondent could not bank upon the same against the petitioner.  Agreeing with the submission, Justice Gupta referred to 'Toofan Singh vs. State of Tamil Nadu 2021 where the Supreme Court held that the statement recorded in terms of Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence under the Act as the officers who are vested with powers under Section 53 of the NDPS Act are police officers within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.  "In view of the said verdict the statements by the accused persons recorded in terms of Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be the mere reason for disallowing the bail unless other circumstances also call for rejection of bail", the bench underscored.  Dealing with the contention of the respondents that call records of the mobile of both the accused confirm the fact that they were in constant touch with each other and deal in the sale and purchase of the contraband, the bench observed the call records of the mobiles will ultimately nail the petitioner-accused in the present case is a matter of trial and neet not be considered while hearing an application for bail.  It placed firm reliance on State by (NCB) Bengaluru vs. Pallulabid Ahmed Arimutta and another 2022 wherein the Supreme court refused to dismiss a bail application on the basis of call records and held that the same can be examined at the stage of trial.  Accordingly, the court allowed the application and the accused was granted bail subject to furnishing of two surety bonds and personal bond to the tune of Rs.1 lakh, each to the satisfaction of the trail court.

The Delhi High Court has observed that a minor child is entitled to claim maintenance for his upbringing by the father and that such a child is not bound by the divorce settlement regarding maintenance between his parents.  Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh was dealing with an appeal filed by a minor child being aggrieved by the grant of interim maintenance by the Family Court at Rs. 15,000 per month.  The High Court had vide order dated April 22, 2021 enhanced the said maintenance amount and directed the father to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor, considering that his school fee itself was in that range. Observing that when the mother of the minor child obtained divorce by mutual consent, the maintenance was fixed in respect of the child at Rs. 5,000 per month, the Court said: "It goes without saying that the appellant being a minor, is not bound by that settlement, and he is entitled to claim maintenance for himself for his upbringing from the respondent i.e., his father." The appellant had contended that the father had not truly and correctly disclosed his income and that from his Income Tax Returns (ITRs) filed before the Court, it appeared that apart from agricultural income which was the only income claimed to have been earned by the father, he had been deriving rental income from a property, which was separate from the agricultural income. The counsel appearing for the minor child had vehemently challenged the averments made in the affidavit filed by the father thereby claiming that he had deliberately mis-stated facts before the Court. "Considering the fact that the present appeal is directed against the fixation of the interim maintenance at the rate of Rs. 15,000/- per month, which we have raised to Rs. 25,000/- per month, and the appellant's petition is still pending consideration before the learned Family Court, we are inclined to relegate the parties to the learned Family Court to establish their respective claims/ defence before the learned Family Court, and to invite the final order from the learned Family Court," the Court said.  The Court therefore disposed of the appeal with a direction to the respondent father to continue to pay Rs. 25,000 per month to the minor child till the disposal of the petition preferred by the child, or till further orders that the Family Court may pass.  "The right of the appellant to seek further enhancement, even at the interim stage, is preserved. No adjournments shall be sought by the parties, nor should either of the parties be granted any undue adjournments by the learned Family Court, and we request the learned Family Court to dispose of the petition pending before it under Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 within the next one year," the Court added.  The Court said that all rights and contentions of the parties, including those raised in the appeal, were preserved and shall be examined by the Family Court. Title: FATEH SAHARAN v.

A bench comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka was dealing with an appeal against a High Court judgment which refused to exercise powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the summons issued to the Directors of a Company, which was facing a complaint over dishonour of cheque(Ashutosh Ashok Parasrampuriya and another versus M/s Gharrkul Industries Pvt Ltd). The complaint had averred that all Directors of the appellant Company are responsible for its business and all the appellants are involved in the business of the Company and are responsible for all the affairs of the Company. Taking this into account, the High Court had dismissed the petition filed under Section 482 CrPC by the Directors. Approving the decision of the High Court, the Supreme Court noted that it is well settled by precedents that powers under Section 482 CrPC cannot be invoked to quash the summons against the Directors if the complaint has the basic averments against them. The Court noted that Section 141 of the NI Act imposes vicarious liability on the "every person who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company"  However, it is open for the Directors to contest during the trial that they were not in charge and were not responsible for the conduct of the company. "We are concerned in this case with Directors who are not signatories to the cheques. So far as Directors who are not the signatories to the cheques or who are not Managing  Directors or Joint Managing Directors are concerned, it is clear from the conclusions drawn in the afore­stated judgment that it is necessary to aver in the complaint filed under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the NI Act that at the relevant time when the offence was committed, the Directors were in charge of and were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company", the Court observed. The Court added that "this averment assumes importance because it is the basic and essential averment which persuades the Magistrate to issue process against the Director". If this basic averment is missing, the Magistrate is legally justified in not issuing process. "In the case on hand, reading the complaint as a whole, it is clear that the allegations in the complaint are that at the time at which the cheques were issued by the Company and dishonoured by the Bank, the appellants were the Directors of the Company and were responsible for its business and all the appellants were involved in the business of the  Company and were responsible for all the affairs of the Company. It may not be proper to split while reading the complaint so as to come to a conclusion that the allegations as a whole are not sufficient to fulfil the requirement of Section 141 of the NI Act. The complaint specifically refers to the point of time when the cheques were issued, their presentment,dishonour and failure to pay in spite of notice of dishonour. In the given circumstances, we have no hesitation in overruling the argument made by the learned counsel for the appellants".

The Telangana High Court has ruled that if a dispute constitutes a 'commercial dispute' under Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the dispute is the subject matter of a domestic arbitration whose 'Specified Value' is more than Rs. One Crore, then an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) would lie only before the Commercial Court and not before the Civil Court.  The Bench, consisting of Justices P. Naveen Rao and Sambasivarao Naidu, held that to treat an immovable property as 'used' for commercial purposes, so as to fall within the ambit of Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, it is not necessary that the present lessee should commence commercial operations in the said property. The Court added that it was sufficient if the immovable property was already put to use for commercial purposes by someone else.  The respondent/lessee M/s. A.A. Avocations Pvt. Ltd. and the appellant/lessor Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation Limited entered into a lease agreement. Under the lease agreement, the respondent was granted permission to develop, operate and maintain a tourism and party area on the leased property. After certain disputes arose between the parties, the respondent invoked the arbitration agreement.  The respondent filed an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act before the Civil Court seeking interim measures of protection till the arbitral proceedings were commenced. The respondent sought interim relief from the Civil Court restraining the appellant from forcefully and illegally dispossessing the respondent from the premises of the leased property. The said application was allowed by the Civil Court, who granted an interim injunction in favour of the respondent. Against this order, the appellant filed an appeal before the Telangana High Court.  The appellant Telangana State Tourism Development submitted before the High Court that since the dispute between the parties was a commercial dispute which arose out of a commercial transaction, the application under Section 9 of the A&C Act should have been filed by the respondent before a Commercial Court and not a Civil Court. The appellant averred that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to pass an order on the said application filed by the respondent.  The appellant contended that it had raised an issue disputing the maintainability of the application under Section 9 of the A&C Act before the Civil Court, however, the Civil Court did not consider the said preliminary issue.  The respondent/lessee A. A. Avocations averred that the respondent had not commenced any commercial activity on the leased property and that the leased property was not put to use by it, therefore, the dispute between the parties was not a commercial dispute. Thus, the respondent submitted that the application filed by it under Section 9 of the A&C Act was maintainable before the Civil Court.  The Court noted that the appellant, in its written arguments filed before the Civil Court, had contended that since the transaction between the parties was commercial in nature and the value of the dispute was above Rs. One Crore, the Civil Court had no jurisdiction. The Court observed that the appellant had raised the said preliminary objection and had averred before the Civil Court that the respondent must avail the remedy provided under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.   The Court observed that the Civil Court did not record the said preliminary objections raised by the appellant and that it did not hold any discussion on the validity of the preliminary objections. The Court noted that the Civil Court merely held that the objections raised by the appellant were not maintainable, without elaborating on the reasons.  The Court held that the objections raised by the appellant regarding the maintainability of the application under Section 9 of the A&C Act before the Civil Court went into the root of the litigation. The Court ruled that the Civil Court ought to have decided on the validity of the said objections before going into the merits of the application.  Thus, the Court ruled that the order passed by the Civil Court was vitiated and was liable to be set aside.  The Court observed that Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 defines 'commercial dispute' as a dispute that arises out of agreements relating to immovable property that is used exclusively in trade or commerce.  The Court noted that Section 10 (3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides that where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, and the arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, then all applications or appeals filed under the A&C Act, which would ordinarily lie before the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, shall be filed in and be heard by the Commercial Court, where such Commercial Court has been constituted.  The Court further observed that Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act prescribes the mechanism to determine the 'Specified Value'.  Thus, the Court held that on a cumulative reading of the provisions of Section 2 (1) (c) (vii), Section 10 and Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act, it is clear that if a dispute arises out of an agreement concerning an immovable property, which is used exclusively in trade or commerce, and if the 'Specified Value' of the dispute is more than Rs. One Crore, then the said dispute would constitute a 'commercial dispute'. The Court held that in that case only the Commercial Court would have the jurisdiction to deal with the application filed under Section 9 of the A&C Act.  The Court noted that as per the provisions of the lease deed between the parties, it was evident that the lessor/appellant had earlier granted a lease of the same land to another party, who had built certain structures on the said land. After the lease deed with the previous lessee was terminated, the appellant entered into a fresh lease deed with the respondent.  Thus, the Court held that commercial operations were already carried out in the leased property by the previous lessee, who had developed the leased land for commercial purposes.   The Court noted that the present lessee/respondent had taken the place of the previous lessee to use the said leased property for commercial purposes. Thus, the Court held that the said leased land was already put to use exclusively for commercial purposes by the previous lessee.  Therefore, the Court ruled that Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act was attracted and thus, the dispute between the appellant and the respondent was a commercial dispute.  The Court held that to treat an immovable property as 'used' for commercial purposes, as provided under Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, it is not necessary that the present lessee should commence commercial operations. The Court added that it was sufficient if the immovable property was already put to use for commercial purposes by someone else.  Thus, the Court ruled that the said leased property was a commercial property.   The Court held that since the arrears of rent with respect to the leased property was more than Rs. 2 Crores, thus the 'Specified Value' of the dispute was more than Rs. One Crore. Therefore, the Court ruled that in view of the provisions of Section 10 read with Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the respondent ought to have filed an application under Section 9 of the A&C Act before the Commercial Court only and not before the Civil Court.  Thus, the Court ruled that the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the application filed by the respondent under Section 9 of the A&C Act. Hence, the Court allowed the appeal filed by the appellant and set aside the order passed by the Civil Court.  Case Title: Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation Limited versus M/s. A.A.

The Supreme Court observed that it is the duty of Pharmacy Council and State Government to see that the hospitals/medical stores etc., are not run by the fake pharmacist and are run by the registered pharmacist only. Running the hospitals/dispensaries in absence of any registered pharmacist and/or running such hospitals by fake pharmacist and even running the medical stores by fake pharmacist and without even any pharmacist will ultimately affect the health of the citizen, the bench of Justices MR Shah and MM Sundresh observed while it restored a Public Interest Litigation before the Patna High Court that raised this issue. One Mukesh Kumar had filed a Public Interest Litigation before the Patna High Court in which he alleged that in various Govt. Hospitals, the persons, who are not a registered Pharmacist are being allowed to discharge the function of a Pharmacist. At some places, even the Clerks, Staff Nurse etc. have been assigned with the duty to be performed only by a registered Pharmacists, the plea had alleged. This petition was disposed of by the High Court recording the submission that the Bihar State Pharmacy Council constituted a fact finding committee and its report was already forwarded to the State Government. The court had also clarified that only such those persons, who are eligible and fulfill the requisite conditions, can be registered with the Bihar State Pharmacy Council. During the previous hearing of the Special Leave Petition against this judgment, the Apex Court bench had observed that by permitting the fake pharmacists to run the medical stores and/or functioning, it will be playing with the life of the citizens. The State ought to have been vigilant to curb and stop the fake pharmacists, it was observed. Now while disposing the appeal, the bench observed that the writ petition raised a very serious grievances touching the health and life of the citizen.  "Running the hospitals/dispensaries in absence of any registered pharmacist and/or running such hospitals by fake pharmacist and even running the medical stores by fake pharmacist and without even any pharmacist will ultimately affect the health of the citizen. The State Government and the Bihar State Pharmacy Council cannot be permitted to play with the health and life of the citizen", the bench said while allowing the appeal and restoring the PIL before the High Court. The court directed the High Court to call for detailed report/counter from the State of Bihar and Bihar State Pharmacy Council on (i) how many Governments' hospitals/hospitals/medical stores/private hospitals are being run either by fake pharmacist or without registered pharmacist; (ii) whether any action is taken by the State Government on the fact-finding committee report submitted by the Bihar State Pharmacy Council which was reported to be forwarded to the State Government; (iii) whether there are any fake pharmacists as alleged in the writ petition; (iv) any action is taken by the State Government or by the Bihar State Pharmacy Council against such fake pharmacist; (v) whether the Pharmacy Practice Regulations, 2015 are being followed in the entire State of Bihar or not.

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Anganwadi workers alleging that they were not promoted to the post of 'Mukhya Sevika' on account of discrimination between those working at the District Panchayat level and those working under the Municipal Corporation.

The Gujarat High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Anganwadi workers alleging that they were not promoted to the post of 'Mukhya Sevika' on account of discrimination between those working at the District Panchayat level and those working under the Municipal Corporation.  It was alleged that Anganwadi Workers from District Panchayats were elevated to the aforesaid post while those from the Municipal Corporation were deemed ineligible.  However, the Bench comprising Justice AY Kogje observed:  "The Court does not find any discriminatory clause in the policy however, considering the argument of learned advocate for the petitioners that the Anganwadi Workers, who were working under the District Development Officer were given priority and they stole the march over the petitioners for the promotion to the post of the Mukhya Sevika, in the opinion of the Court, would be attributable to the procedure which is undertaken by two separate establishments, depending upon the exigency which existed there, but such cannot be the ground to decide that the resolution was itself discriminatory in any manner."  The Court also noted that whereas the policy for promotions was framed in the year 2005 and relaxation in age for first round of promotions was announced in the year 2007, the actual procedure for effecting promotions only commenced in the year 2011, by which time the Petitioners had superannuated. In this backdrop, the Court clarified, "Date on which the resolutions are framed, cannot be treated to be the date relevant for the purpose of deciding the entitlement of the petitioners. The relevant date to decide the entitlement would be the procedure that would be undertaken for the purpose of promotion which in the present case, is in the year 2011 for the first time and therefore, the age of the petitioners on the date on which the promotions are to be considered is relevant." Petitioners assailed the impugned Government Resolution which framed the policy of promotion by claiming that it was arbitrary and discriminatory and violative of Art 14. Additionally, the Petitioners had corresponded with the authorities for long but no action was taken. Reliance was placed on Smt. Manjulaben M. Ranavat Anganwadi Worker v/s. District Development Office to submit that in an identical situation of the Anganwadi Worker, she was given the post of Mukhya Sevika. Basis their age (45 years or 48 years), they were entitled to the promotion, as well.  The Municipal Corporation opposed the submission on the ground that the age of the Petitioners had surpassed 48 years. Therefore, their names did not appear in the list of selected candidates.   The Bench admitted that the upper age limit was fixed at 48 years while referring to the Government Resolution of 2007, even as the Petitioners were above that age. In fact, at the time of filing the instant application, the Petitioner was 55 years of age in 2017. Reliance on Manjulaben  was dismissed by the Bench on the ground that the case involved a discrepancy in the date of birth of the Anganwadi Worker. Addressing the contention regarding violation of Art 14, the High Court could not find any discriminatory clause.   Lastly, the High Court rejected the argument of the Petitioner that their eligibility cannot be adjudicated from the date on which the Resolutions were framed (2005 and 2007). The High Court explained that the entitlement of the Petitioners for the promotion would be determined from the year 2011 when the procedure for promotion was first decided.  Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.  Case No.: C/SCA/9589/2017  Case Title: PRITIBEN CHHAGANLAL KANJARIAYA v/s STATE OF GUJARAT & 4 other(s)    
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that non-consideration by the detaining authority, a detenu's representation against an order for his preventive detention, violates such detenu's rights under Article 22 of the Constitution.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that non-consideration by the detaining authority, a detenu's representation against an order for his preventive detention, violates such detenu's rights under Article 22 of the Constitution.  Justice Sanjeev Kumar observed:  "I am of the considered view that the impugned order of detention does not sustain in the eye of law, in that, the representation made on his behalf by his mother has not been considered by the respondents. Right of the detenue to make a representation and to have the same considered by the competent authority is a fundamental right guaranteed to a person under detention under Article 22 of the Constitution and the infraction of such a right renders the detention illegal and unconstitutional."  The Court was considering a petition filed by one Aijaz Ahmad Sofi through his mother seeking quashing of his detention order issued by District Magistrate, Srinagar.  The ground for challenge was that the representation submitted by the detenue against his detention was not considered by the detaining authority.  As per detenue, the detaining authority did not show its awareness with regard to the fact that he was granted bail in one of the FIRs that formed part of the grounds for his detention, speaking volumes about the non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority.  The Respondent stated that based on detenues activities, the detaining authority was of the view that detenue remaining outside would have been detrimental to the security of state. However, there was no mention of the acceptance /rejection of representation made by the detenue through his mother.  "The detenue has not only specifically averred but has also placed on record copy of the representation submitted by the detenue through his mother. Although the respondents are silent about the representation made by the detenue through his mother, but the detenue has placed on record the postal receipt testifying the submission of the representation by him through his mother. There is no denial or rebuttal of the same by the respondents in their reply affidavit. In these circumstances, this Court has no option but to presume that the representation has been made by the detenue through his mother to the competent authority but the same has not been adverted to and considered" Court said  The Court observed that the order of detention impugned in this petition cannot survive on the touchstone of settled legal position and the express right guaranteed to the detenue under Article 22 of the Constitution.   Accordingly, the petition was allowed. CASE TITLE: Aijaz Ahmad Sofi v. UT of J&K and another    
Explaining the scope and power of the court under Section 319 CrPC, the Allahabad High Court recently observed that this provision allows the court to summon those persons who are not named in the charge sheet to appear and face trial (in certain circumstances). The Bench of Justice Vikas Budhwar observed that the very object of engrafting section 319 Cr.P.C. is to not allow a person who deserves to be tried to go scot-free.  It may be noted that under Section 319 CrPC, the Court has been given the power to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of offence in the course of any inquiry into, or trial of, an offence. In other words, Section 319 CrPC gives power to the Trial Court to proceed against a person who has not been named in the charge sheet, if evidence of the involvement of that person emerges during the trial/inquiry. The High Court in the instant matter underscored that once the Magistrate finds that there is sufficient material available on record before it to summon a person in the trial which is proposed to be undertaken, then the powers u/s 319 Cr.P.C. are to be invoked. "The stage which is contemplated under section 319 Cr.P.C. 1973 is a stage before the conclusion of the trial and thus, only one conclusion can be drawn that the Magistrate must be prima facie of the opinion that there are sufficient material and cause for summoning the culprit who is either not named in the FIR or if named, he has not been charge-sheeted or discharged," the Court further said. Essentially, the Bench was dealing with a revision plea filed by one Rameshwar and another challenging an order of the Court of Sessions Judge, Mahoba summoning the accused under section 319 crpc in connection with an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (punishable under Section 304 IPC) The revisionists submitted that the entire exercise to summon them was illegal, as revisionists have not committed the offence and there was no occasion/prima facie case to issue the summons to face trial. On the other hand, defending the order of the trial court, the A.G.A argued that from the narration of the allegation contained in the FIR vis-a-vis, the statement of PWs, the name of the revisionists have been pin pointed and further there was sufficient evidence on record to exercise power under Section 319 CrPC. In its order, the Court noted that while engrafting section 319 Cr.P.C. the words employed were: "in the course of any inquiry into, or trial of, an offence, it appears from the evidence", which shows that the degree of satisfaction has to be accorded by the Magistrate while exercising powers u/s 319 Cr.P.C. However, the Court noted that the degree of satisfaction defers from case to case and according to the degree of satisfaction, the test to be applied as one should be more than a prima facie case at the stage of framing of charges. "...it can be very well said that once the Magistrate finds that there was sufficient material available on record before it to summon a person in the trial which is proposed to be undertaken thenthe powers u/s 319 Cr.P.C. are to be invoked." Now, referring to the facts of the case, the Court noted that in the FIR lodged by the complainant (the brother of the deceased), revisionists were arrayed as accused and more so, in the statement so recorded under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC, names of the revisionists find its presence.  The Court also observed that in the statement of PWs, the name of the revisionists has appeared and thus, the Court added, the Court was within its jurisdiction and powers to have summoned the revisionist. "So far as the argument so sought to be raised by learned counsel for the revisionists with regard to the fact that they have not committed the offence and the confessional statement of one of the co-accused, who was though not named in the FIR, but against whom, charge sheet was submitted is a matter of defence, which will be available to the revisionists at the time, when the trial gets commence," the Court ordered as it dismissed the revision plea.

While granting pre-arrest bail to an accused person, the Himachal Pradesh High Court recently said that custodial interrogation cannot be used to extract confession. The observations were made by Justice Satyen Vaidya while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner was praying for a pre-arrest bail in an FIR for offences under Section 408 and Section 34 of IPC.  The FIR was registered by the employer of the petitioner alleging misappropriation of an amount to the tune of Rs.28,57,022 at his petrol station. It was argued before the court that the transactions in the bank account of the accused were made at the instance and consent of the complainant and the accounts manager of the establishment. The accused further contended that during investigation, he had fully cooperated and provided the entire detail of accounts to the police. The bench said that the case was registered on 19.11.2022, and the petitioner was admitted to interim bail on 23.11.2022. Since more than a month has elapsed since the registration of FIR and the petitioner has joined the investigation as and when required, the investigating agency already had sufficient time at its disposal to complete the investigation, the court added.  While perusing the available record, the bench further noted that as per the investigation report, a sum of Rs.2,45,645/- stands transferred from the account of the petitioner to the account of the complaint enterprise, which prima-facie suggests that the bank account of complainant “Stan H.P. Enterprises” was receiving payments from the account of the petitioner.  "How and why there was no re-conciliation of the account of the Petrol Station, has not been explained. Had the petitioner intended to misappropriate the amount by depositing the same to his account, he would not have remitted any amount to the account of the Petrol Station," said the court. Dealing with the contention of the respondents that the petitioner is not disclosing the name of persons in whose account he has transferred the money, the court said that the contention does not appear to be justified for the reason that the bank transactions can be ascertained by the police from documentary evidence. "As regards the allegation of money withdrawn by the petitioner from his account and the non-disclosure of identity of persons to whom it has been disbursed, those facts may not be so relevant for proving all the allegations levelled against petitioner. The investigation in a criminal case cannot be used as a recovery proceeding", the bench explained.  Finding the arguments of the respondent for seeking his custodial interrogation devoid of any merit, the court said "I am of the considered view that no case for custodial interrogation of petitioner is made out. The tool of custodial interrogation cannot be used to extract confession. Such interrogation is permissible where the Investigating Agency is without any means to extract the facts. As noticed above, in the instant case the bank transactions can easily be ascertained through documentary evidence." Allowing the petition, the court ordered that the petitioner be released on bail in case of his arrest.  Case Title: Rohit Chauhan Vs State of Himachal Pradesh  Coram: Justice Satyen Vaidya

The Jharkhand High Court recently granted relief to a 26-year-old woman who had moved the Court seeking adequate security against her family members and other co-religious persons claiming that her family members are forcing her to marry a 52-year-old Man.  The bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi directed the Senior Superintendent of Police, Ranchi to pass appropriate order so that her dignity and life be protected.  Essentially, Petitioner Sana Rashid claimed in her plea before the Court that she is in friendship with a boy (belonging to a different religion) and her family members are trying to get her married to a person aged about 52 years and she is not willing to marry that person.   It was further stated in her plea that she apprehends that the said boy and his family members may be targeted by others. In view of this, she sought protection from her family members.  At the outset, the Court took into account the averments made in the petition as well as representations sent to the higher authorities and found that prima facie, the petitioner is in trouble.  Further, the Court also made a significant remark that nowadays, educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life partners which, in turn, is a departure from the earlier norms of society where caste and community play a major role.   The Court also opined that there is every likelihood that this is the way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such inter-marriage, however, these youngsters face threats by the elders of their own families.   Against this backdrop, the Court emphasized that the right to marry a person of choice was held to be integral to Article 21 of the Constitution of India where the autonomy of an individual inter alia in relation to family and marriage was held to be integral to the dignity of the individual.  Consequently, seeing the urgency in the matter, the Court passed the aforementioned order directing the Senior Superintendent of Police, Ranchi to hear the petitioner and to pass the appropriate order so that her dignity and life be protected.  With this, the plea was disposed of.  Case title - Sana Rashid v. The State of Jharkhand and others

In a significant observation, the Allahabad High Court has said that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to show its collective will to restrain the criminals from entering into the politics, Parliament, or legislature to save democracy and the country governed on democratic principles and rule of law. The Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed thus while denying bail to a sitting Member of Parliament (Bahujan Samaj Party), Atul Rai in connection with an Abetment of suicide case. The bench also noted that Rai is facing 23 criminal cases, which include cases of kidnapping, murder, rape, and other heinous offences. The case in brief A case was registered against Rai under Sections 376, 420, 406, and 506 IPC on a complaint by a victim, who later on attempted to commit suicide along with her friend within the precincts of the Supreme Court India in August 2021. Read more about the case here: Man & Woman Attempt Self Immolation Outside Supreme Court They were admitted in very serious and critical conditions to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, and later on, they died on 21.08.2021 and 24.08.2021 respectively. Pursuant to their unfortunate death, the instant case was registered against Rai under Sections 120B, 167, 195A, 218, 306, 504, and 506 IPC. Now, seeking bail in the instant case, Rai had moved the High Court, however, denying him bail, the Court noted that Rai is a 'Bahubali, a criminal turned politician which was evident from his long criminal history of heinous offences. The Court also observed that in the rape case against Rai (lodged by the victim), after the police investigated the offence and filed a charge sheet against him, he had terrorized and put undue pressure on the victim/prosecutrix, and had got several cases registered against her and her friend/witness so that they would not support the prosecution case. The Court also took into account an application given by the victim to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Varanasi alleging that Rai was abating and drawing her close to committing suicide and that she was being continuously harassed physically and mentally and subjected to cruelty to change her stand before the Court.  Court's significant observations regarding the entry of criminals into Politics  At the outset, the Court called it unfortunate and the greatest irony of the largest democracy of the world that as many as 43 per cent of the members of Lok Sabha who got elected in the 2019 general elections are having criminal cases including cases related to heinous offences pending against them. The court also observed that there have been several instances of persons charged with serious and heinous offences like murder, rape, kidnapping and dacoity and they got tickets to contest elections from political parties and even got elected in a large number of cases.  Referring to Apex Court's observations in the case of Public Interest Foundation & Ors vs Union of India & Anr : (2019) 3 SCC 224, the Court observed thus: "The Supreme Court has said that this leads to a very undesirous and embarrassing situation of law breakers becoming law makers and moving around police protection. The Supreme Court in the said case has directed the Election Commission of India to take appropriate measures to curb criminalization in politics but unfortunately collective will of the Parliament has not moved in the said direction to protect the Indian Democracy going in the hands of criminals, thugs and law breakers. If the politicians are law breakers, citizens cannot expect accountable and transparent governance and the society governed by the rule of law be an utopian idea. After independence with every election, role of identities such as caste, community, ethnicity, gender, religion etc, has been becoming more and more prominent in giving tickets to winnable candidates. These identities coupled with money and muscle power has made entry of criminals in politics easy and every political party without exception (may be with some difference in degree and extent) uses these criminals to win elections. Giving tickets to candidates with serious criminal charges would break the confidence and trust of the civil society, law abiding citizens of this country in the electoral politics and elections." The Court also underscored that earlier, 'Bahubalis' and other criminals used to provide support to candidates on various considerations including caste, religion and political shelter but now criminals themselves are entering into politics and getting elected as the political parties do not have any inhibition in giving tickets to candidates with criminal background including those having heinous offence(s) registered against them.  Further, the Court also stressed upon the responsibility of civil society as well to rise above the parochial and narrow considerations of caste, community etc and to ensure that a candidate with criminal background does not get elected. Lastly, opining that Parliament and the Election Commission of India are required to take effective measures to wean away criminals from politics and break the unholy nexus between criminal politicians and bureaucrats, the Court remarked thus: "There is an unholy alliance between organized crime, the politicians and the bureaucrats and this nexus between them have become pervasive reality. This phenomenon has eroded the credibility, effectiveness, and impartiality of the law enforcement agencies and administration. This has resulted into lack of trust and confidence in administration and justice delivery system of the country as the accused such as the present accused-applicant win over the witnesses, influence investigation and tamper with the evidence by using their money, muscle and political power. Alarming number of criminals reaching Parliament and State Assembly is a wake up call for all." Case title - Atul Kumar Singh Alias Atul Rai S/O Shri Bharat Singh v. State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the applications filed by certain banks seeking to recall the 2015 judgment in the case Reserve Bank of India v Jayantilal N. Mistry which had held that the RBI was obliged to disclose defaulters list, inspection reports, annual statements etc., related to banks under the RTI Act.A bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran dismissed... The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the applications filed by certain banks seeking to recall the 2015 judgment in the case Reserve Bank of India v Jayantilal N. Mistry which had held that the RBI was obliged to disclose defaulters list, inspection reports, annual statements etc., related to banks under the RTI Act. A bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran dismissed the applications observing that the Supreme Court Rules did not have any provision for filing any application for recall of a judgment. "There is no provision in the Supreme Court Rules for filing any application for recall of the judgment of this Court", the bench observed. However, the bench has given liberty to the applicants to pursue other available legal remedies against the Jayantilal Mistry judgment. About the Jayantilal Mistry case In the Jayantilal Mistry case, the Supreme Court had rejected the argument of the Reserve Bank of India that it was holding the information of banks in a fiduciary capacity, and therefore such information was exempted from disclosure under the Right to Information Act as per Section 8(1)(e). The Apex Court was considering a batch of transferred cases from various High Courts wherein the order passed by the Central Information Commission (CIC) directing the RBI to furnish the Information sought to the applicants under the RTI Act. A bench comprising Jusitces MY Eqbal and C Nagappan had held that RBI does not place itself in a fiduciary relationship with the Financial institutions because, the reports of the inspections, statements of the bank, information related to the business obtained by the RBI are not under the pretext of confidence or trust. The Court held that information obtained under a regulatory capacity or under the mandate of law cannot be termed as information held under fiduciary capacity. "RBI is supposed to uphold public interest and not the interest of individual banks. RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI has no legal duty to maximize the benefit of any public sector or private sector bank, and thus there is no relationship of 'trust' between them. RBI has a statutory duty to uphold the interest of the public at large, the depositors, the country's economy and the banking sector. Thus, RBI ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might embarrass individual banks", the judgment stated. The Court expressed the opinion that the RBI has to act with transparency and not hide information that might embarrass the banks and that it is duty bound to comply withthe provisions of the Act and disclose the information sought Later, contempt petitions were filed after the RBI contending that the disclosure policy framed by the RBI in 2016 were contrary to the directions in the Jayantlal Mistry judgment. In April 2019, a bench comprising Justices Nageswara Rao and MR Shah directed the RBI to withdraw the disclosure policy to the extent it permitted exemptions contrary to the Supreme Court verdict (Girish Mittal v. Parvati V. Sundaram & Anr). The Court held that the violations of its direction by the RBI will be viewed seriously. Recall applications not maintainable; they are review applications in disguise Following that, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and few other banks filed application seeking recall of the Jayantlal Mistry case. They contended that the judgment was passed without hearing them, and hence was in violation of the principles of natural justice. It was further contended that the judgment required reconsideration after the Supreme Court declared "right to privacy" to be a fundamental right in 2017 in the KS Puttaswamy case. Rejecting these arguments, the bench first said that the Supreme Court rules did not permit the filing of an application seeking recall of a judgment. As regards the applicants' argument that the recall applications are maintainable when the judgment is passed without hearing the affected party, the bench noted that it was decision of RBI which was under challenge in that case. Also, none of the banks made any effort to get themselves impleaded in the case, when it was being heard by the Court. The bench observed that the recall applications are essentially review applications in disguise. "The applications styled as recall are essentially applications for review. The nomenclature given to an application is of absolutely no consequence -what is of importance is the substance of the application. A close scrutiny of the applications for recall makes it clear that in substance, the applicants are seeking a review of the judgment in Jayantilal N.Mistry (supra). Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that these applications are not maintainable", the order written by Justice Rao said. Case Details Title : Reserve Bank of India v Jayantilal N.

The Supreme Court has held that Consumer Courts can grant relief to flatbuyers who are aggrieved with the delay in delivery of the apartment as per the agreement.Consumer Courts have the power to direct refund and compensation to a consumer for the deficiency in not delivering the apartment as per the terms of Agreement, the Court held."A consumer invoking the jurisdiction of the Commission... The Supreme Court has held that Consumer Courts can grant relief to flatbuyers who are aggrieved with the delay in delivery of the apartment as per the agreement. Consumer Courts have the power to direct refund and compensation to a consumer for the deficiency in not delivering the apartment as per the terms of Agreement, the Court held. "A consumer invoking the jurisdiction of the Commission can seek such reliefs as he/she considers appropriate. A consumer can pray for refund of the money with interest and compensation. The consumer could also ask for possession of the apartment with compensation.", the bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and PS Narasimha observed. In this case, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed a Developer to refund an amount of Rs. 2,06,41,379 with interest @ 9% p.a. to the Consumer for its failure to deliver possession of the apartment within the time stipulated as per the Apartment Buyers Agreement. The issue raised in the appeal by the builder are the following: I. Whether the terms of the Apartment Buyers Agreement amount to an 'unfair trade practice' and whether the Commission is justified in not giving effect to the terms of Apartment Buyer's Agreement as laid down in the Pioneer case?  II. Whether the Commission has the power under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to direct refund of the amount deposited by the Consumer with interest? Regarding the first issue, the bench upheld the Commission's finding that the clauses of the agreement are one-sided and that the Consumer is not bound to accept the possession of the apartment and can seek refund of the amount deposited by her with interest. On the second issue, the bench first considered the submission of the appellant that the Consumer, having elected to proceed under the Act, the provisions of the RERA Act will have no application. Referring to Imperia Structures Ltd v. Anil Patni (2020) 10 SCC 783 and IREO Grace Realtech (P) Ltd. V. Abhishek Khanna (2021) 3 SCC 241, the bench observed that Consumer Protection Act and the RERA Act neither exclude nor contradict each other. In this regard, the court observed: "When Statutes provisioning judicial remedies fall for construction, the choice of the interpretative outcomes should also depend on the constitutional duty to create effective judicial remedies in furtherance of access to justice. A meaningful interpretation that effectuates access to justice is a constitutional imperative and it is this duty that must inform the interpretative criterion.. When Statutes provide more than one judicial fora for effectuating a right or to enforce a duty-obligation, it is a feature of remedial choices offered by the State for an effective access to justice. Therefore, while interpreting statutes provisioning plurality of remedies, it is necessary for Courts to harmonise the  provisions in a constructive manner." Referring to Section 14 of Consumer Protection act, the bench , while dismissing the appeal filed by the developer, observed: 15. We may hasten to clarify that the power to direct refund of the amount and to compensate a consumer for the deficiency in not delivering the apartment as per the terms of Agreement is within the jurisdiction of the Consumer Courts. Under Section 14 of the Consumer Protection Act, if the Commission is satisfied …that any of the allegations contained in the complaint about the services are proved, it shall issue an order to the opposite party directing him to, return to the complainant the price or as the case may be, the charges paid by the complainant. 'Deficiency' is defined under Section 2(g) to include any shortcoming or inadequacy in performance which has been undertaken by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise relating to any service. These two provisions are reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference.13 It is clear from the statutory position that the Commission is empowered to direct refund of the price or the charges paid by the consumer A consumer invoking the jurisdiction of the Commission can seek such reliefs as he/she considers appropriate. A consumer can pray for refund of the money with interest and compensation. The consumer could also ask for possession of the apartment with compensation. The consumer can also make a prayer for both in the alternative. If a consumer prays for refund of the amount, without an alternative prayer, the Commission will recognize such a right and grant it, of course subject to the merits of the case. If a consumer seeks alternative reliefs, the Commission will consider the matter in the facts and circumstances of the case and will pass appropriate orders as justice demands. This position is similar to the mandate under Section 18 of the RERA Act.

The action of the State Government in sub-classifying the minorities by providing scholarship at 80% to Muslims and 20% to Latin Catholics & Converted Christians cannot be legally sustained, the Court held.The Kerala High Court on Friday quashed orders of the Kerala Government announcing scholarships to Muslim students and Latin Catholic/Converted Christians in the ratio 80:20. Declaring that the orders could not be legally sustainable, Justice Shaji P Chaly, speaking for the Bench of himself and Chief Justice Manikumar directed the State to provide merit-cum-means scholarships... The Kerala High Court on Friday quashed orders of the Kerala Government announcing scholarships to Muslim students and Latin Catholic/Converted Christians in the ratio 80:20.  Declaring that the orders could not be legally sustainable, Justice Shaji P Chaly, speaking for the Bench of himself and Chief Justice Manikumar directed the State to provide merit-cum-means scholarships to members of notified minority communities equally.   "We hereby direct the State Government to pass requisite and appropriate Government Orders providing merit-cum-means scholarship to the members of the notified minority communities within the state equally, in accordance with the latest population census available with the State Minority Commission", the operative part of the judgment states.  With this, the Court allowed a petition filed by lawyer Justine Pallivathukal. The petition alleged that the State Government was giving undue preference to the Muslim Community over the members of other minority communities in the state. Facts and submissions  The specific bone of contention was with respect to a scholarship scheme announced by the State Government for students from minority communities. The scheme was announced pursuant to proposals submitted by a 11-member committee. The Committee had been tasked with implementing the recommendations of the Justice Rajinder Sachar committee in Kerala. The Sachar Committee was a high level committee set-up to report on the social, economic, educational status of the Muslim community in India. As part of the scholarship scheme, the State Government provided 5000 scholarships for degree and post graduate Muslim women students. The benefit of the scheme was, in February 2011, later extended to students belonging to the Latin Catholic and Converted Christian Communities. As per a Government Order in 2015, it was stated that reservation among Muslims and other minority communities would be in the ratio 80:20 (80% for Muslims, 20% for Latin Catholic Christians and other communities).  In the petition, State Government's scheme is contrasted with a scholarship announced by the Union Government in 2006, where scholarships were provided to students belonging to minority communities, on a merit-cum-means basis as well. Nowhere was it stated that scholarships were provided to any particular minority community in preference to other minority communities, the petitioner asserted in the petition. "State of Kerala under the guise of promoting the minority communities is showing undue favouritism to Muslim community to the detriment of other minority communities. In the case of Christian community, other than Latin Catholic and converted Christians, no benefit is given to the rest of the group resulting in total discrimination," the petition also read.  With these assertions, the petitioner sought that the discrimination be remedied and the scholarships distributed uniformly to all minority communities. As an alternative prayer, the petitioner sought that the scholarships be distributed in accordance with the ratio of population of each minority community.  The State argued, based on the Sachar Committee and Kerala Padana Report, that Muslims were behind Christians in college enrollment. There were only 3% landless Christians, while 37.8% of Muslims were landless among Muslims, it was stated. Muslims in Kerala are in toto a backward community while in other religious minorities including Christians, the Roman Catholics and some other sects among Christians are not backward communities, it was contended. Court's holding Among other issues discussed, the Court held that there is nothing wrong in the State Government providing facilities to weaker sections of the community, but when it comes to dealing with the notified minorities, "it has to treat them equally".  The judgment states that the government was not vested with any powers to treat them unequally. "But here is a case where without taking into account the entitlement of the Christian Minority community within the State available from the population ratio, State is indulging in providing scholarship to the Muslim minority community at 80%, which according to us, is an unconstitutional act and unsupported by any law. Mere executive orders issued by the State Government cannot overreach the provisions of the Minority Commissions Acts, 1992 and 2014, and the imperatives contained under the provisions of the Constitution of India discussed above. Article 29 also casts a duty to protect the educational interests of the minority community in equal measure and not in a discriminatory manner." Describing the allotment as a ration as a 'sub-classifcation', the Court said, "Therefore, deducing the facts, circumstances and the laws, we are of the considered opinion that the action of the State Government in sub-classifying the minorities by providing merit-cum-means scholarship at 80% to Muslim community and 20% to the Latin Catholic Christians and Converted Christians cannot be legally sustained" Urging the state to provide merit-cum-means scholarship equally to all notified minorities, the petition was allowed.

The Allahabad High Court has stayed the decision of the Uttar Pradesh government to appoint 6800 additional candidates as primary assistant teachers in the state in addition to already appointed 69000 candidates. The Bench of Justice Rajan Roy made it clear that the Government can't appoint more than 69000 candidates without issuing an advertisement regarding the same, since in the original advertisement issued by the state, only 69000 posts were intended to be filled.  The case in brief Essentially, in the original advertisement (for the post of assistant teachers) issued in December 2018, 69000 posts were intended to be filed, however, after all the posts were filled up, the Government had come out with an additional list of 6800 candidates. This very decision was challenged in the instant writ petition filed by Bharti Patel And 5 Others.  Justifying its decision, the state government sought to explain the backdrop against which it came out with the additional list. It was told to the Court that certain reserved category candidates had filed petitions before the High Court in 2020, challenging the appointment made to 69000 posts pursuant to the December 2018 advertisement. It was the contention of such reserved category candidates that since they had secured marks higher than the cut-off for the general category, therefore, they are entitled to be considered and selected for the unreserved posts. Therefore, the State revisited the implementation of reservation policy and took a decision to issue a fresh select list containing names of 6800 candidates, and they are those reserved category persons who have secured higher marks than the cut-off for the unreserved category. The argument of the petitioners The counsel for the petitioners primarily contended that no appointment could be made in excess of the 69000 vacancies which were advertised initially in December 2018 by the State Government. It was further argued that the correct course of action is that the writ petition of the reserved category candidates (pending before the Court) should be heard on a priority basis and if the additional 6800 selectees are, in fact, entitled to be appointed, then they be appointed and those who are not entitled among the 69000 candidates must be ousted. Court's order At the outset, the Advocate General for the State Could could not explain to the Court as to how if 69000 posts have already been filled up, these 6800 selectees would be appointed, against which post they would be appointed, and whether against one post two persons can work and get a salary. Further, the Court noted that in the writ plea moved by reserved category candidates challenging the appointment of 69000 posts, the Court had only asked the State to file counter affidavit in the matter and the State was required to explain as to how the reservation policy has been implemented. However, the Court further observed, instead of doing the same, the State officials issued a select list of 6800 persons in addition to the 69000 appointments already made by them without disengaging or canceling the appointment of 6800 candidates already appointed if they had secured lesser marks. In this regard, the Court also referred to an Apex Court's order dismissing a writ petition wherein it was the case that vacancies in excess of 69000 which were not advertised on 01.12.2018 should be allowed to be filled up on the basis of the said selection advertised on 01.12.2018. The Court had explicitly observed that posts in excess of those advertised cannot be allowed to be filled up based on the said selection Against this backdrop, staying the appointment of these 6800 candidates, the Court observed thus: "Considering the fact that only 69000 posts were advertised, candidates in excess of 69000 cannot be appointed and they already having been appointed, one fails to understand as to what purpose the issuance of select list of 6800 persons, who may otherwise have been entitled to selection and appointment, seeks to achieve in the factual scenario created by the State, as, in no circumstances, persons can be appointed in excess of 69000 which were advertised. Now, it is for the State to decide what it has to do in the matter as it is the State which has created this situation but one thing is very clear that persons beyond 69000 vacancies cannot be appointed against such posts." Lastly, the Court has now listed the matter for February 18, 2022, when the stand of the 6800 would be taken into account along with the petition already pending which has been filed by the reserved category candidates.  Case title - Bharti Patel And 5 Others v.

In many such cases, there may be prisoners older than 75 years of age dying in the jails, which clearly depicts the ineffectiveness of the Sentence Review Board. The Commission media report has observed that the contents thereof, if true, amount to violation of human rights of the victim: NHRCThe National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, India has taken suo-motu cognizance of the acquittal of a man in a rape case, twenty years after his conviction and has has observed that it seems to be a case of non-application of the Section 433 Cr PC. Significantly, this case is about a 23-year-old man (now 43), who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court in a rape case... The National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, India has taken suo-motu cognizance of the acquittal of a man in a rape case, twenty years after his conviction and has has observed that it seems to be a case of non-application of the Section 433 Cr PC. Significantly, this case is about a 23-year-old man (now 43), who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court in a rape case and who has now been declared innocent by the Allahabad High Court after twenty years. It is important to note that the Allahabad High Court, in January 2021, came to his rescue,  after he suffered 20 years of incarceration in connection with a false rape case filed against him by a woman owing to an alleged land dispute. During this period, every member of his family had died. His conduct in the jail was always found good, but his application for furlough was not allowed to attend the cremation of his father. He was not even allowed to attend his brother's funeral. Section 433 of CrPC  It may be noted that as per Section 433 CrPC, the Government can commute a sentence (of death, Life Imprisonment, rigorous imprisonment or simple imprisonment). Under this provision, the Sentence Review Board, under the law needs to reconsider review of the sentence awarded by the court, with a view to commuting the sentence. In this backdrop, the NHRC has stated,  "In many such cases there may be prisoners older than 75 years of age dying in the jails, which clearly depicts ineffectiveness of the Sentence Review Board. The Commission media report has observed that the contents thereof, if true, amount to violation of human rights of the victim." Accordingly, the NHRC has issued notices to the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh calling for a detailed report in the matter. Further, it has been directed that the report must include:-  The action taken against the public servants responsible in this case,Steps taken for the relief and rehabilitation of the victim to compensate up to some extent for the trauma, mental agony and social stigma he has suffered during these years. The response is expected within 6 weeks. About the case in brief  The man was accused of rape, criminal intimidation and sexual exploitation of a woman belonging to Scheduled Caste in 1999, and during the trial of the case by a lower court in Lalitpur District, he was found guilty. In the year 2003, he was moved to Agra Central Jail where his conduct was always good. In the year 2005, he decided to challenge the verdict of the lower court and approached the High Court. After completing a period of fourteen years, the victim moved Mercy Plea and the prison authorities stepped in. The State Legal Services Authorities helped him in preferring an appeal in the High Court and on 28.01.2021, a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court declared him, not guilty. The High Court in its Judgment, observed that the FIR in the matter was lodged three days late and there were no injuries on the private parts of the woman, who was said to have been thrashed. 
The Allahabad High Court on Thursday granted bail to a man booked under the Uttar Pradesh Prevention Of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955 on the condition that he shall serve the cows for a period of one month in Gaushala after his release from the jail. The bench of Justice Shekhar Yadav issued this order while granting bail to one Saleem Alias Kaliya, who was booked under Sections 3/8 of the Cow Slaughter Act, 1955.  Before the Court, the accused argued that he was not named in the first information report and during the investigation, the complicity of the applicant had been shown in the present case on the basis of his confessional statement.  It was further argued that after his arrest, two cases had been slapped upon him, even though nothing had been recovered from his possession and there is no independent eye witness of the recovery.  His counsel contended that the recovery that has been shown is false and fabricated. He made several other submissions in order to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. It was lastly submitted that the accused is in jail since August 2021. Against this backdrop, after perusing the records of the case in the light of the submissions made at the bar and after taking an overall view of all the facts and circumstances of the case, the nature of evidence, the period of detention already undergone, the unlikelihood of early conclusion of the trial and also the absence of any convincing material to indicate the possibility of tampering with the evidence, the Court concluded that the applicant may be enlarged on bail. However, he was granted bail on the following two conditions: "The applicant shall deposit Rs.1 lakh in favor of anyone Registered Gaushal of District Bareilly within a month after release. Immediately after release from jail, the applicant shall himself available at Gaushalal and seve the cows for a period of one month." It may be noted that in September 2021, the Bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav had observed that the Cow should be given the status of National Animal in light of the fact that "Cow is part and parcel of the culture of India" and that eating/consuming Cow-beef can't be considered to be a fundamental right of any person. In the order passed by Justice Yadav, it was also observed that scientists believed that the cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen. "Panchgavya, which is made of cow milk, curd, ghee, urine and cow dung, helps in treatment of several incurable diseases", the judge had said in the order. He had also observed that it is a tradition in India to use ghee made of cow milk during yajna because "this gives special energy to sunrays, which ultimately causes rains". The Court had observed thus as it denied bail to one Javed who has been accused of slaughtering a cow after committing its theft, and booked under S. 379 IPC r/w S. 3, 5, 8 UP Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955. Cow Should Be Declared National Animal; Cow Protection Be Made Fundamental Right Of Hindus : Allahabad High Court Significantly, the Bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, in its bail order written in Hindi, had further observed that Fundamental Rights are not only the prerogative of beef eaters, rather, those who worship the cow and are financially dependent on cows, also have the Fundamental Right to lead a meaningful life. Case title - Saleem Alias Kaliya Vs. State of U.P. [CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 48222 of 2021]    
The Kerala High Court recently reiterated that the inquiry envisaged under Section 340 of Cr.P.C is mandatory in nature and such an enquiry should be conducted before proceeding further in cases involving allegation of commission of offences under Sections 192, 193 and 195 of IPC. Justice A. Badharudeen observed that,  ...the inquiry envisaged under Section 340 of Cr.P.C is mandatory in nature and such an enquiry should be conducted before proceeding further, in cases involving allegation of commission of offences under Sections 192, 193 and 195 of IPC. Here, evidently, no such enquiry was conducted and therefore, the entire proceedings, thereafter, are non-est. The Petitioner in the instant case was authorized by the Managing Director of KLD Board, a Government of Kerala undertaking, to give evidence before the Munsiff Court in connection with a case, and has been alleged to have given false evidence, on the premise that, during his cross-examination, when a question was put as to lodging of police complaint and sighting of the place/property during the visit of the police to prepare the mahazar, he answered in the negative, though records showed otherwise. It is alleged that the petitioner has given false evidence and committed the offence of perjury and a complaint was lodged against him. The Munsiff send the case to the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Peeerumedu to proceed further. On receipt of the order, the Magistrate passed an order and thereby, took cognizance of the offence punishable under Section 193 of IPC against the petitioner. The Counsel for the petitioner contended that while passing the impugned order the Munsiff failed to conduct the mandatory inquiry provided under Section 340 of Cr.P.C. The Counsel pressed for quashing of the aforesaid proceeding.  The Court observed that from a bare perusal of Section 340 of Cr.P.C. it can be clearly understood that, upon an application made to a court alleging the commission of an offence referred to in clause(b) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 195(offences under Sections 193 to 196 of IPC), if the Court is of opinion that it is expedient in the interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into any offence referred to in clause(b) of sub-section (1) of Section 195, the court may after such preliminary inquiry, if any, as it things necessary (a) record a finding to that effect; (b) make a complaint thereof in writing; (c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having jurisdiction; (d) take sufficient security for the appearance of the accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged offence is non-bailable and the court thinks it necessary so to do, send the accused in custody to such Magistrate; and (e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence before such Magistrate. The Court further observed that in Babu P. Benedict v. Principal, Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, the Kerala High Court had considered the scope of enquiry contemplated under Section 340 of Cr.P.C. and held that the inquiry is mandatory in nature and the word 'may' appearing in the body of Section 340, has to be understood as 'shall'. Therefore, the Court reiterated that the inquiry envisaged under Section 340 of Cr.P.C is mandatory in nature and such an enquiry should be conducted before proceeding further, in cases involving an allegation of commission of offences under Sections 192, 193 and 195 of IPC.  The Court pointed out that in the present case no such enquiry was conducted and therefore, the entire proceedings, thereafter, are non-est. Furthermore, the Court observed that the knowledge of an Officer representing a State Entrepreneur with regard to the facts related to a case cannot be presumed or expected, since his knowledge regarding the case emanates from the official records that he could gather within the short span of time he obtained and likewise, all the omissions or false statements given by a witness, shall not be construed as substantive to attract the offence of perjury. ...nobody, in the ordinary circumstances would expect that an Officer representing a State Entrepreneur, would be aware of each and everything in relation to the case in minute niceties, so that he could say everything in the affirmative. Likewise, all the omissions or false statements given by a witness, shall not be construed as substantive to attract the offence of perjury. The Court thereby allowed the Petition.  Therefore, even otherwise, it could not be held that the petitioner herein intentionally given false evidence before the court, so as to proceed under Section 340 read with Section 195 of Cr.P.C. Therefore, the entire proceedings are vitiated and the same are liable to be quashed. Senior Advocate Sumathy Dandapani and Advocate Millu Dandapani appeared for the Petitioner. Public Prosecutor Advocate G. Sudheer appeared for the Respondent.  Case Title: Sajeevan v. State of Kerala     
The Supreme Court observed that the intent of the Army Act is not to protect army personnel by awarding them lesser punishment even for serious offences"If that was the intent of the legislature- that is to protect persons subject to the Army Act by awarding them lesser punishment even for serious offences - then the Act would not have provided for concurrent jurisdiction of court-martial... The Supreme Court observed that the intent of the Army Act is not to protect army personnel by awarding them lesser punishment even for serious offences "If that was the intent of the legislature- that is to protect persons subject to the Army Act by awarding them lesser punishment even for serious offences - then the Act would not have provided for concurrent jurisdiction of court-martial and ordinary criminal courts at all", the bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant observed while allowing an appeal filed by the State of Sikkim against an order passed by the Sikkim High Court which directed that a criminal case against an army officer be handed over to court-martial. In this case, an FIR under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 had been registered against the accused army man who had allegedly shot down a rifleman named Balbir Singh. On 15 December 2014, the custody of the accused was handed over by the competent military authority to the Investigating Officer. On 28 February 2015, a case was registered as Sessions Trial Case No.03/2015 and charges were framed.  The Sessions Court held that since both the accused and the deceased were governed by the Army Act 1950 when the incident took place, in view of Section 69 of the Army Act, the accused could be tried only by a General Court-Martial and not by the Sessions Court. Therefore, the Chief Judicial Magistrate was directed to give written notice to the CO of the respondent's unit or the competent military authority for his trial by a court-martial. The High Court upheld this order of the Sessions Court and this made the State of Sikkim approach the Apex Court. The Apex Court bench, on the question of jurisdiction of Sessions Court, in this case, held that the criminal court will have jurisdiction to try a case against an army personnel if the Commanding Officer does not exercise the discretion under Section 125 of the Army Act to initiate court-martial with respect to the offence. If the designated officer does not exercise this discretion to institute proceedings before a court-martial, the Army Act would not interdict the exercise of jurisdiction by the ordinary criminal court, the Court held. "The Sessions Judge was competent and there was no error in the assumption or the exercise of the jurisdiction. The consequence of the decision of the High Court is to foist an obligation on the Army Authorities to hold a court-martial despite a clear and unequivocal submission to the jurisdiction of the Court of Sessions", the court said. The above observations were made while considering the contention raised on behalf of the accused that if the trial is conducted by the ordinary criminal court and not a court-martial under the Army Act, the accused would not be able to avail the benefit of being awarded a lower punishment under the Army Act. The court noted that Sub-section (a) of Section 69 states if a person is convicted of a 'civil offence' which is punishable with death or transportation under the law in force, then he shall be liable to suffer any punishment, other than whipping, assigned for the offence by the aforesaid law and such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned. Sub-Section (b) provides that in all other offences, the person convicted shall be liable to suffer the punishment assigned under the laws in force or imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or such less punishment as provided in the Act. Referring to this provision, the bench observed: "The words of the statute clearly indicate that the legislature provided different punishments for serious offences which under law are punishable with death or life imprisonment, and for all other offences. In case of the former, subSection (a) of Section 69 provides that the court-martial may convict him and punish him with death or life imprisonment. In addition to this, the court-martial may also give a lesser punishment under the Army Act (such as cashiering, dismissal from  service, etc., provided under Section 7127). The use of the word "and" in sub-Section (a) clarifies the intent of the legislature, which is to ensure that the Army authorities have sufficient discretion to grant a punishment for serious offences, over and beyond what is permissible under Penal Code. This however, does not imply that a person who is otherwise liable for death or life imprisonment can be granted a lesser punishment under the Army Act. In contrast, sub-Section (b) of Section 69 uses the term "or" to indicate that for offences that under the Penal Code or any other law are of less severity, the Army authorities may order a lesser punishment" While rejecting the contention raised by the accused, the bench observed thus while allowing the appeal: If the argument of the respondent is accepted, it would imply that a person who is convicted and punished by a Court-martial under the Army Act will be in an advantageous position than a person who, though subject to the Army Act, has been convicted by an ordinary criminal court. If that was the intent of the legislature - that is to protect persons subject to the Army Act by awarding them lesser punishment even for serious offences - then the Act would not have provided for concurrent jurisdiction of court-martial and ordinary criminal courts at all. Although the Army Act is special law in this case as compared to the IPC, if the statute in its text does not make any qualifications or exceptions to the general law, it would be impermissible for the court to read such qualifications in the Act. Thus, we are unable to accept this submission of the respondent. Case Details:

The Gujarat High Court on Thursday passed an interim order stating that the provisions of  the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, will not apply to inter-faith marriages which take place without force, allurement or fraudulent means.A division bench comprising Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav passed the interim order to protect the parties of inter-faith marriage from being unnecessarily harassed."After recording the preliminary submissions and arguments advanced, we have directed as follows. We are therefore of the opinion that pending further hearing, the rigours of Section 3, 4, 4A to 4C, 5, 6, and 6A shall not operate merely because marriage is solemnized by a person of one religion with another religion without force or allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriages for the purposes of unlawful conversion. The above interim order is provided only on the lines of the arguments made by the learned Advocate General Mr.Trivedi  and to protect the parties of inter-faith marriage from being unnecessarily harassed".The bench passed the order in a writ petition filed by Jamiat Ulama-E-Hind and Muhahid Nafees challenging the provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021.Senior Advocate Mihir Joshi assisted by Advocate MTM Hakim had appeared for the petitioners and Advocate General Kamal Trivedi appeared for Gujarat Government. The Court had reserved the case for pronouncement of interim orders for today after detailed arguments on August 5 and 17.  
The Supreme Court (4:1) in its judgment upholding validity of demonetisation, observed that the word “recommendation” in Section 26(2) of RBI Act would mean a consultative process between the Central Board of Reserve Bank of India and the Central Government. "Merely because the Central Government has advised the Central Board to consider recommending demonetization and that the Central Board, on the advice of the Central Government, has considered the proposal for demonetization and recommended it and, thereafter, the Central Government has taken a decision, in our view, cannot be a ground to hold that the procedure prescribed under Section 26 of the RBI Act was breached.", the majority comprising of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer, B R Gavai, A S Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian observed. Section 26(2) of the RBI Act reads thus: On recommendation of the Central Board, the Central Government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender save at such office or agency of the Bank and to such extent as may be specified in the notification.” The contention raised by the petitioners was that the procedure prescribed under Section 26(2) is breached as the proposal has emanated from the Central Government whereas the requirement is that the proposal should emanate from the Central Board.  The majority judgment observed that the two requirements of sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act are (i) recommendation by the Central Board; and (ii) the decision by the Central Government. “recommendation” would mean a consultative process "The scheme mandates that before the Central Government takes a decision with regard to demonetization, it would be required to consider the recommendation of the Central Board. We find that, in the context in which it is used, the word “recommendation” would mean a consultative process between the Central Board and the Central Government" It cannot be said that there was no conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful consultation As such, the enquiry would be limited to find out whether both the Central Board and the Central Government had made their respective points of view known to each other and discussed and examined the relative merits of their views. It will have to be considered whether each of the party had disclosed to the other all relevant facts and factors for due deliberation, or not. The limited enquiry would be whether the recommendation by the Central Board was made after complete consideration of the matter on the basis of all the relevant facts and material before it, or not.. As already discussed herein above, the record itself reveals that the RBI and the Central Government were in consultation with each other for a period of six months before the impugned notification was issued. The record would also reveal that all the relevant information was shared by both the Central Board as well as the Central Government with each other. As such, it cannot be said that there was no conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful consultation. Justice BV Nagarathna's dissent RBI Act does not envisage initiation of demonetisation of bank notes by the Central Government.  Justice Nagarathna observed that the majority judgment does not recognise the essential fact that the Act does not envisage initiation of demonetisation of bank notes by the Central Government.  "The essential ingredients of sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Act can be epitomised as under: i) on the recommendation of the Central Board of the Bank; ii) the Central Government by notification in the Gazette of India; iii) may declare any series of bank notes of any denomination to cease to be legal tender; iv) with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification; v) to such extent as may be specified in the notification; Therefore, under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Act, the Central Government would act only on the recommendation made by the Central Board of the Bank, which is the initiator of demonetisation of bank notes.", the judge observed Initiation on the strength of Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution The judge agreed with the submission of Attorney General that the Central Government cannot be said to be without powers in initiating demonetisation of bank notes. "This is on the strength of Entry 36 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The Central Government is not just concerned with the financial health of the country as well as its economy, but it is also concerned with the sovereignty and integrity of India; the security of the State; the defence of the country; its friendly relations with foreign countries; internal and external security and various other aspects of governance. On the other hand, the Bank is only concerned with the regulation of currency notes, monetary policy framework, maintaining price stability and allied matters. Therefore, if the Central Government is of the considered opinion that in order to meet certain objectives such as the ones stated in the impugned notification, namely, to eradicate black money, fake currency, terror funding etc., it is necessary to demonetise the currency notes in circulation, then the Central Government may initiate a proposal for demonetisation." Justice Nagarathna added that demonetisation of the entire series of currency notes cannot be done by the Central Government by issuing a notification under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act, as it gives power only to cancel a specified series of notes. The dissenting judge also opined that the RBI did not independently apply its mind regarding the Centre's proposal for demonetisation and that the entire exercise was done in 24 hours.

The Kerala High Court on Thursday held that an additional document can be produced after prosecution evidence is complete if the omission of such document was a bonafide mistake and the document is purported to be vital.  A single bench of Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas was considering a challenge to an order of the Additional Sessions Court that permitted the prosecution to produce an FIR to show the motive of the accused, after the prosecution had completed its evidence. The accused who is being tried for offences under Section 302 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code, opposed the production of the additional document. The court however, observed that “…there is no embargo on the production of additional documents during a trial if they are essential for arriving at a proper decision. If the requirements of justice command the production of such a document, the trial judge can permit such production, based on principles of fair play and good sense. No fetter can be placed on the right of the party to produce such a document.”  Public Prosecutor Adv. Vipin Narayan argued that the FIR produced as additional document was a vital piece of evidence required to show the motive of the accused, i.e prior enimity, as it related to a previous incident of assault by the accused. The prosecution submitted that it had wrongly produced another FIR in evidence, by a bonafide mistake as the said FIR also related to an incident between the accused and deceased.  The counsel for the petitioner Adv. John S. Ralph contended that the defence had examined witnesses based on the FIR it later alleged to have been the wrong document. The petitioner averred that the prosecution was trying to vary its case after realising it had failed to prove motive. The petitioner argued that this was only an attempt to delay the proceedings and to overcome the lacuna in the prosecution’s case.  The court observed that while it is well settled law that the prosecution cannot fill up any lacuna in its case during the trial:  “However, the term lacuna cannot be interpreted to mean the deficiency of the prosecutor. The term lacuna means an inherent defect or an inherent flaw in the prosecution case. The lacuna that cannot be permitted to be filled up can only mean the inherent flaw or defect in the prosecution case. A defect in the prosecution case is not the equivalent of a human error committed by the prosecution during the evidence stage either in producing relevant material or in eliciting answers. An oversight on the part of the prosecutor cannot be termed as a lacuna in the prosecution case. The principle that prosecution is not permitted to fill up a lacuna in its case therefore cannot be extended to mean those errors committed during the conduct of a trial, brought about on account of human frailties or mistakes.”  The court referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in P. Chhagan Lal Daga v. M. Sanjay Shaw [(2003) 11 SCC 486] which observed that “the power to receive evidence in exercise of Section 311 of the Code could be exercised "even if evidence on both sides is closed" and such jurisdiction of the Court is dictated by the exigency of the situation and fair play”.  The court refused to set aside the order of the Additional Sessions Court allowing the application of the prosecution under Section 311 of the CrPC for production of an additional document after prosecution evidence was complete. The court held that:  “I am satisfied that the omission to produce FIR No.54 of 2009 was a bonafide mistake which requires to be rectified. Fair play and good sense demand that the production of a document purported to be vital is permitted.”  Case Title: Thachanalil Shyju V State of Kerala   
The Supreme Court has held that a Special Court under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act can conduct joint trial of the offences under the MMDR Act along with the offences under the Indian Penal Code as per Section 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Section 220 CrPC specifies the situations where joint trial of offences are possible.

The Supreme Court has held that a Special Court under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act can conduct joint trial of the offences under the MMDR Act along with the offences under the Indian Penal Code as per Section 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 220 CrPC specifies the situations where joint trial of offences are possible.  The Court noted, on a combined reading of Sections 4 and 5 of CrPC along with Section 30C of the MMDR Act, that the procedure prescribed under the Code shall be applicable to proceedings before the Special Court unless the MMDR Act provides anything to the contrary.  The Court also held that the fact that Special Courts are created for MMDR offences as per Section 30B does not lead to an inference that such courts cannot take cognizance of IPC offence. The bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Vikram Nath and Justice BV Nagarathna observed : "The Judicial Magistrate First Class is invested with the authority to try offences under Sections 409 and 420 IPC. On the other hand, the Sessions Judge is appointed as a Special Judge for the purposes of the MMDR Act. If the offences under the MMDR Act and the IPC are tried together by the Special Judge, there arises no anomaly, for it is not a case where a judge placed lower in the hierarchy has been artificially vested with the power to try the offences under both the MMDR Act and the Code. Additionally, if the offences are tried separately by different fora though they arise out of the same transaction, there would be a multiplicity of proceedings and wastage of judicial time, and may result in contradictory judgments. It is a settled principle of law that a construction that permits hardship, inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomaly must be avoided. Section 30B of the MMDR Act and Section 220 CrPC can be harmoniously construed and such a construction furthers justice. Therefore, Section 30B cannot be held to impliedly repeal the application of Section 220 CrPC to the proceedings before the Special Court".  In conclusion, the Court held : The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible under Section 220 CrPC. There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that Section 220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act;  Section 30B of the MMDR Act does not impliedly repeal Section 220 CrPC. Both the provisions can be read harmoniously and such an interpretation furthers justice and prevents hardship since it prevents a multiplicity of proceedings. The Court also held that the Special Court does not have, in the absence of a specific provision to that effect, the power to take cognizance of an offence under the MMDR Ac twithout the case being committed to it by the Magistrate under Section 209 CrPC.

The Rajasthan High Court observed that the petitioner is a married brother of the deceased government servant, and therefore, the petitioner cannot be held to be a dependant and to be entitled for compassionate appointment in terms of the Rajasthan Compassionate Appointment of Dependants of Deceased Government Servants Rules, 1996. Justice Rekha Borana, while dismissing the writ... The Rajasthan High Court observed that the petitioner is a married brother of the deceased government servant, and therefore, the petitioner cannot be held to be a dependant and to be entitled for compassionate appointment in terms of the Rajasthan Compassionate Appointment of Dependants of Deceased Government Servants Rules, 1996. Justice Rekha Borana, while dismissing the writ petition, opined,  "Admittedly, the petitioner is married and therefore, in terms of the Rules of 1996, the petitioner cannot be held to be a dependant and to be entitled for compassionate appointment. In view of the specific provisions of law, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the order dated 01.01.2019." Essentially, the petitioner is the brother of the deceased government servant, Ramesh Jangid who expired on 22.05.2018. The present writ petition has been filed against an order, whereby the application of the petitioner for compassionate appointment after the death of his brother, who was a government servant, has been rejected. The application was rejected on the premise that in terms of Rule 2(c)(v) of the Rules, 1996, the married brother of a deceased government servant being not a 'dependant' is not entitled for compassionate appointment. The court noted that the Rules provide for the compassionate appointment to a dependant of the deceased government servant and an unmarried brother of an unmarried deceased government servant does not fall within the definition of 'dependant'. 
In the Contractual sphere, (like that of a tender), judicial scrutiny must be cautiously exercised because the author of the contract is the best judge of its requirements and eligibility conditions and courts should only interfere in case that eligibility criteria or conditions are arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable or malafide, Andhra Pradesh High Court has held. Justice U.... In the Contractual sphere, (like that of a tender), judicial scrutiny must be cautiously exercised because the author of the contract is the best judge of its requirements and eligibility conditions and courts should only interfere in case that eligibility criteria or conditions are arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable or malafide, Andhra Pradesh High Court has held.  Justice U. Durga Prasad Rao while dismissing a petition seeking to declare a tender notification illegal citing arbitrary and unreasonable eligibility conditions, observed that judicial intervention in state instrumentalities must be limited, arising only when there are doubts about the procedure being arbitrary and against public interest.  Facts  An e-procurement tender notification was issued in January 2021 for the supply of school bags for the year 2021-2022 under Jagananna Vidya Kanuka Scheme. This notification was floated in consonance with Central Government's Samagra Shiksha Scheme and procurement of school's bags under this scheme is governed by the manual of Financial Management and Procurement and the grants under the scheme are to be governed by various mandatory provisions of GFR.  Petitioner's case was that the first tender notification had an eligibility criteria condition that the annual turnover of the firm for the previous three years immediately preceding the tender notification should be more than INR 30 Crores and the firm should also furnish the latest solvency certificate (adding the condition "for a minimum value of 50% of the ECV" two days prior to bid closing date).  Petitioner attended the pre-bid meeting and raised an issue that the eligibility criteria of furnishing of solvency certificate of such a high value, two days prior to bid closing was unreasonable and then emailed the same objection on 10th March 2021 but without considering Petitioner's objections, another tender was floated and the criteria were made even more onerous by changing the turnover requirement from 30 crores to 100 crores and thus, the petitioner argued that for a contract estimated at 78 Crores, the condition to impose average annual turnover was arbitrary, illegal and unreasonable and was added specifically to benefit certain bidders at the behest of the others.  Respondent's case was that the entire tender process was looked into by a High-Level Committee constituted by the Government of Andhra Pradesh which was to implement the project under APSSA. And APSSA had the liberty to frame its own procedure for procurement for the scheme's purpose.  This Committee had issued both the tender notifications. When the first notification was issued, the writ petitioner had not participated in the tender and 5 firms had submitted applications, out of which during technical evaluation, no bidder was found to have fulfilled the eligibility criteria.  And thus, the Committee decided to cancel the previous bid and float another bid with a different criterion, increasing the annual turnover, so that qualified, efficient firms could participate in the tender for better quality and timely supply and the entire process was fair and transparent. In this round, six firms had participated and five had qualified the technical evaluation and respondent no. 4 was declared as L1 and the bidding was closed.  Thus, the respondents argued that there was no violation of Articles 14 and 19 as alleged by the petitioner and no public interest was being hampered and the writ petition must be dismissed on grounds of maintainability.  The respondents had also vociferously claimed that since the petitioner had not participated in either bid, he had no locus standi to even file the present writ petition. The respondents also claimed that because the tender invitations come under the realm of Contracts, the present Court should not sit as a court of appeal to scrutinize the conditions therein.  Judgment  The High Court at the outset looked at whether the petitioner had the locus standi in the current case and stated that "mere appearance in a pre-bid meeting does not amount to participation in the tender process". Further noting that the petitioner did not even offer a quotation in response to the tender notification, he is already not suited to question the legality of the tender.   However, the Court still decided to test the veracity of these conditions on judicial principles noting that the petitioner had challenged the eligibility criteria itself.  The Court determined whether it could question the tender conditions and referred to a plethora of judgments, including but not limited to Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of Jammu & Kashmir, Food Corporation of India v. Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries, Sterling Computers Limited v. M&N Publications Limited, Tata Cellular v. Union of India, Jamshed Hormusji Wadia v. Board of trustees, Jagdish Mandal v. the State of Orissa, and several others.  All the judicial pronouncements referred above implied in administrative matters, contractual matters or matters involving state instrumentalities, judicial intervention should be minimum and should only come into play when there are doubts about the aforementioned compromising with public interest, or violating the tenets of Fundamental rights laid in the Constitution or are biased, arbitrary, illegal, irrational, unreasonable and malafide.  The Court also perused the apex court's words in Uflex Limited v. The Government of Tamil Nadu, where the apex court had held that "The object of judicial review is not to make the court an appellate authority for scrutinizing as to whom the tender should be awarded. Economic must be permitted to play its role for which tendering authority knows best as to what is suited in terms of technology and price."  The High Court then laid out certain points which emerged from such perusal of landmark judgments and noted that in the matter of government contracts, article 14 must be followed scrupulously and the Court can only probe whether due procedure is followed or not. The court further stated that greater latitude must be conceded to state authorities for formulating conditions of a tender document unless their action is found to be malicious. Averring that if state instrumentalities act fairly and reasonable, the judicial review should be restricted, the High Court proceeded to analyze the claims in the writ petition.  Primarily the court took note of the fact that although the petitioner had claimed to have protested against the condition of production of the latest solvency certificate for 50% of ECV, he had not challenged that through the writ petition and thus, he could not now call that condition atrocious. The Court further noted that even objectively, when the ECV was 78 Crores, the above solvency certificate requirement could not be said to be arbitrary.   Then the court looked at the condition regarding the average annual turnover of INR 100 crore and stated that if a manufacturer couldn't manufacture INR 100 Crore worth of stock in one year then his ability to manufacture and deliver stock worth INR 78 Crore was questionable.  Regarding the petitioner's claim that the conditions were changed in the second tender to give undue advantage to respondent no.4 (L1), the court noted that this stipulation of bidder's annual average turnover being more than INR 100 Crore was relevant to test the bidder's capability and resources to be able to perform the contract successfully.  Thus, the High Court held that the impugned conditions were to subserve the public interest and the petition was lacking in merit and thus, it was dismissed by the High Court with no order to costs.

The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a petition filed seeking to declare the Karnataka Civil Services (Validation of Selection and Appointment of 2011 Batch Gazetted Probationers) Act 2022 as unconstitutional, illegal and void.Through the said Act, the government has validated the recruitment of 362 gazetted 'probationers' of the 2011 batch, selected by the Karnataka Public... The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a petition filed seeking to declare the Karnataka Civil Services (Validation of Selection and Appointment of 2011 Batch Gazetted Probationers) Act 2022 as unconstitutional, illegal and void. Through the said Act, the government has validated the recruitment of 362 gazetted 'probationers' of the 2011 batch, selected by the Karnataka Public Service Commission. A division bench of Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice S R Krishna Kumar while dismissing the petition filed by one Mohammed Arif Jameel said,  "We are of the considered view that the entire Act would not become bad in law simply because the earlier selection was challenged in the High Court and was quashed and thereafter, the impugned Act has come in force." It added, "Learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to show any provision of the impugned Act which can be treated to be unconstitutional, illegal or void. In view of the above, we do not find any reason to grant indulgence." Advocate Rahamathulla Kothwal appearing for the petitioner had submitted that earlier the entire selection process was challenged before the High Court in W.P.Nos.13617-13627/2017 and connected matters. It is alleged that it was thereafter that the respondents enacted the Karnataka Civil Services (Validation of Selection and Appointment of 2011 Batch Gazetted Probationers) Act, 2022 in order to overcome the judgment passed by the High Court. The contention was that the enactment of the impugned Act is a colourable exercise of power and as such, bad in law. The plea also sought setting aside of the appointment orders issued on 22.03.2022, in pursuance of the impugned Act. The bench on considering the submission and records said, "So far as the consequential prayers made in the writ petition, suffice it to observe that the aggrieved persons have already approached the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal where the matters are pending consideration. 
Averring that the powers under Article 227 of the Constitution should be exercised sparingly, only with a view to keep the Tribunals/ subordinate Courts within the bounds of their authority, the Gujarat High Court has rejected a petition praying for a direction upon the Respondent to carry out necessary repairs in the suit property.  The petitioner had approached the High Court against the order passed by a City Civil Court, rejecting such prayer. Bench comprising Justice Ashokkumar Joshi observed, "High Court cannot interfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or just because another view than the one taken by the Tribunals or Courts subordinate to it, is a possible view. In other words the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly exercised." The Petitioner (Original Plaintiff) filed a suit for repairs for suit property which was owned by the Respondents (Original Defendants). The suit property was rented out to the Petitioners in 2003 wherein the Petitioners were selling readymade garments. The Petitioners contested that a certain portion of the property was broken and likely to cause injuries. Consequently, as regular payers of rent to the Respondents, the Petitioner requested for conducting repairs on the property. However, the same was denied by the Respondents. Subsequently, the Petitioner filed a civil suit which was rejected by the trial court.  Contesting that the trial court failed to take into account the factual aspects of the case, the Petitioner submitted that the order was against the principles of equity as enshrined in the Transfer of Property Act. The repairs ought to have been permitted for the making the premises habitable for labour since the property consisted of a go-down. It was further stated that the Petitioner was in great financial distress due to the pandemic and yet the Respondent did not permit repairs.  Per contra, the Respondent supported the order of the court and urged that the High Court could not interfere with the order due to limited powers under Art 227.  Taking note of the contentions, the relied on Shalini Shyam Shetty and Another Vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil, (2010) 8 SCC 329, where the Apex Court had stated:  "The Apex Court has considered in detail the scope of interference by this Court to hold and observe that, Article 227 can be invoked by the High Court Suo motu as a custodian of justice. An improper and a frequent exercise of this power would be counterproductive and will divest this extraordinary power of its strength and vitality."  The power of superintendence under Article 227 is neither original nor appellate and is extended to both administrative and judicial superintendence. Per contra, Article 226 is normally exercised where a party is affected but Art 227 is exercised by the High Court as the suo motu custodian of justice. The Bench enumerated the following differences between Art 226 and 227:  A petition under Art 227 is not a writ petition since the power of superintendence under Art 227 is vastly different from power under Art 226.The High Court cannot exercise power under Art 226 at the drop of a hot. In cases where alternative statutory remedy is available, the High Court should exercise restraint.  After noting these differences, reference was made to Puri Investments v. Young Friends and Co. and Ors. - MANU/SC0290/2022 to opine that where there is no perversity in the order of the Tribunal or gross and manifest failure of justice on the basic principles of natural justice, the High Court cannot interfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or just because the other court has taken a different view.  Consequently, Justice Joshi dismissed the petition as being devoid of merits.  Case Title: SHIV GARMENT THROUGH SOLE PROP.

While expressing concern about the plight of the jail- inmates not released despite bail orders passed due to delay in communication of such orders, the Supreme Court on Thursday approved the use of an electronic system named FASTER (Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic Records) for transmission of e-authenticated copies of orders. "It is high time to utilise the Information and Communication Technology tools for efficient transmission of Court's orders", a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said. The bench has observed that the requisite amendment in the Rules and Procedure for the Supreme Court of India for inclusion of the system will be taken up on the administrative side. A bench comprising CJI Ramana, Justice Nageswara Rao and Justice Surya Kant has issued the directions in its suo motu case taken to address the problem of delayed release of prisoners after grant of bail.  The FASTER (Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic Records) system proposes transmission of e-authenticated copies of the interim orders, stay orders, bail orders and record of proceedings to the duty-holders for compliance and due execution, through a secured electronic communication channel. The Bench has directed the Director General, National Informatics Centre, Secretary (Home) along with the Director General or Inspector General of Prisons of all the States and Union Territories to ensure smooth and successful implementation of FASTER system and coordinate with the Supreme Court's Registry in this regard. The Bench has directed all the duty-holders to amend their Rules/ Procedure/Practice/directions forthwith to recognise the e-authenticated copy of the order of the Top Court communicated to them through FASTER system and comply with the directions contained therein. "...all the duty-holders shall amend their Rules/Procedure/Practice/directions forthwith, to recognize the e-authenticated copy of the order of this Court communicated to them through FASTER system and shall comply with the directions contained therein" The Apex Court has also directed the Chief Secretaries of all the States and Union Territories to ensure the availability of internet facility with adequate speed in each and every jail and take necessary steps to arrange for internet facility expeditiously wherever the same is not available. Till then, the communication is directed to be made through the Nodal Officers of the State Governments under FASTER system. The Court has directed the implementation of the FASTER system after perusing the proposal submitted by Secretary General of the Supreme Court suggesting modalities for implementation and the pre-requisites and the timelines to work out the pre-requisites for implementation of the system. States to ensure availability of internet facilities 19 States have submitted compliance reports/affidavits with regard to the availability of internet facility in prisons.  "The States of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Assam and Mizoram have indicated non-availability/partial availability of internet connectivity. The rest of the states have not filed affidavits in this regard. We direct the Chief Secretaries of all the States/UTs to ensure the availability of internet facilities with adequate speed in each and every jail in their respective States/UTs and take necessary steps to arrange for internet facilities expeditiously wherever the same is not available. Till then, the communication shall be made through the Nodal Officers of the State Governments under the FASTER system. The Director-General, National Informatics Centre, Secretary (Home) of all the States/UTs and the Director-General/Inspector General of Prisons of all the States/UTs shall ensure smooth and successful implementation of the FASTER system and shall coordinate with the Registry of this Court in this regard", the order said. Background On July 16, taking suo motu cognizance of the issue, a Bench led by CJI had on last occasion observed that the Supreme Court was thinking of implementing a system to electronically transmit bail orders to prisons so that the release of prisoners on bail will not be delayed. The suo motu case was prompted by a news report which stated that the convicts lodged in Agra Central Jail have not been released even after 3 days of the order granting them bail. The Bench had asked the State Governments/Union Territories the details of whether efficient internet facilities are available in their respective prisons. If not, the States were directed to suggest alternative if any. The Bench had also directed the Secretary General of the Supreme Court to submit a proposal suggesting the modalities to implement FASTER system within two weeks. The Secretary General was directed to coordinate/consult with the Amicus Curiae, Mr. Dushyant Dave, Senior counsel, Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India, the National Informatics Centre or other Government Authorities, in this behalf.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday stayed the proceedings of a 2014 criminal case against the Chief Minister of Delhi and National Convener of Aam Admi Party (AAP), Arvind Kejriwal, pending before the MP/MLA Court in the state's Sultanpur District. The bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh ordered thus while hearing a Section 482 CrPC plea filed by Kejriwal challenging the order of the MP/MLA Court framing charges against him and posted the matter for further hearing on January 13, 2023. The FIR in the case was lodged against Kejriwal in the year 2014 during the general elections for allegedly making false statements during elections (Section 171G IPC), obstructing public servants from discharging their duty (Section 186 IPC), wrongfully restraining persons (section 341 IPC), assaulting public servants to deter them from doing their duty (Section 353 IPC) besides others. The counsel appearing for Kejriwal submitted that earlier in the year 2016, he had moved the High Court challenging the order of the Sultanpur Court taking cognizance and issuing him a summons to face trial, however, the same was dismissed. Thereafter, he challenged HC's order in the Supreme Court, wherein the Top Court in October 2016, issued notices and exempted the appearance of Kejriwal to the trial court until further orders. Against this backdrop, it was submitted that since the Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) is still pending and if the trial is allowed to proceed and if the Special Leave to Appeal is allowed, then the entire proceedings would be a futile exercise. Taking into account the submissions of his counsel, this Court found it appropriate to pass an interim order keeping the proceedings of the case under Sections 143, 186, 188, 341, 353, and 171-G IPC pending before the learned Special Judge (MP/MLA Court)/Additional Sessions Judge, Sultapnpur, in abeyance till the next date of listing of this petition.

The Allahabad High Court last week sentenced former UP MLA Mukhtar Ansari to 5 years in jail in connection with a 23-year-old case under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. With this, the bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh set aside a 2020 order passed by the MP-MLA court acquitting Ansari of charges under the Gangsters Act in a case that was registered against him in the year 1999.  The High Court observed that the trial Court had grossly erred in acquitting Ansari as the HC opined that he is a gangster and he allegedly committed several offences and, therefore, he is found guilty of committing offence under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act and was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.50,000/-. The case in brief An FIR was registered in the year 1999 under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act, alleging therein that Ansari and other co-accused, named in the FIR, constitute a gang, which commits heinous offences, including murder, extortion, kidnapping, and abduction, etc It was further said that the gang members are dreaded criminals, who commit crimes in an organized manner to accumulate wealth for themselves and members of the gang; they strike terror in the hearts and minds of the people and no one dares to lodge FIR even against members of the gang; general public feels in-secured and lives in fear in Lucknow and adjoining areas. The trial Court took into consideration that in all the cases, mentioned in the gang chart, either the accused-respondent was acquitted or a charge sheet was not filed or by the orders of the High Court, the cases were quashed.  It was further noted by the Court that the gang chart was prepared earlier than the FIR was registered and that during the course of the investigation, no detail of property or wealth, which was allegedly accumulated by committing crime, was given and thus, the trial court acquitted Ansari for the offence under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act as the prosecution could not prove the offence against the accused-respondent beyond a reasonable doubt. Challenging the acquittal order, the Government moved the instant appeal before the High Court. It was primarily argued by the state counsel that the basic ingredients to prosecute an individual under the Gangsters Act for the commission of an offence as a gangster is him being a member of the gang and thus, even if no FIR is registered against a person, still he can be prosecuted for the offence under the Gangsters Act.  It was further contended that even if Ansari was acquitted in substantive offences, which are mentioned in the gang chart, because the witnesses turned hostile out of his fear, manipulation, threats and making the witnesses tired by employing other tactics, that would not absolve Ansari from the offence under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act High Court's observations  At the outset, the High Court noted that 'The Gangsters Act has been enacted as a Special Act for prevention and for coping with gangsters and antisocial activities and its purpose is to prevent organized crimes in the State by enacting special provisions and the act is deterrent in nature. The Court further noted that the offence under the Gangsters Act is an independent offence than a substantive offence and if it is proved that a person belongs to a group of persons and commits offence individually or with a group of persons, which are defined under Section 2(b) of the Gangsters Act, then such a person would be a gangster and he could be punished. Against this backdrop, the moot question that arose for Court's consideration was - if Ansari has been acquitted for offences, which were mentioned in the gang chart, (substantive offences), can he still be convicted for offence under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act? To answer this, the Court stressed that since the offence under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act is a distinct and separate offence from the substantive offence, therefore, if the prosecution proves that the person belongs to a gang and indulges himself in committing offence with the object of disturbing public order or of gaining any undue temporal and pecuniary material or other advantages for himself or any other person, he may be punished under the Gangsters Act. Consequently, considering the law laid down by the Supreme Court and the High Court and noting that Ansari was a member of the gang and for his criminal activities several FIRs and charge sheets came to be registered and submitted against him for offences, which are defined under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act, the Court.whi;le holding him guilty, remarked thus: "The acquittal of the accused respondent for turning the witness hostile or otherwise is not a material aspect. The trial Court has grossly erred in acquitting the accused-respondent vide impugned judgment and order. The gangchart was proved in the Court as documentary evidence. In view of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of the view that the accused- [ 21 ] respondent is a gangster and he allegedly committed several offences and, therefore, he is found guilty for offence under Section 2/3 Gangsters Act."  Therefore, the impugned order was set-aside and Ansari was sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.50,000/-. In related news, the Allahabad High Court last week sentenced Ansari to 7 years in jail after holding him guilty of intimidating a Jailer who was performing public duty by abusing him and pointing a revolver/pistol toward him, and threatening to kill him in the year 2003 Case title - State of U.P. v.

The Madras High Court recently granted bail to a man after observing that the entire case against him was based on suspicion and case was taken based on the confession statement.

Therefore, in... The Madras High Court recently granted bail to a man after observing that the entire case against him was based on suspicion and case was taken based on the confession statement. Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice AD Jagdish Chandira also observed that there was no complaint made against the accused.  There was no complaint from any person and nobody was injured in this case. Therefore, in the opinion of this court, the provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act have been included only in order to deny/delay the appellant from getting bail from the court.  The appellant was apprehended by the police under suspicious circumstances. He later confessed that he was deputed by one Bakrudeen, President of Indian Muslim Development Association to kill one Kumaresan. The said Kumaresan had objected to his son marrying Sahanaazmi, daughter of Rajamohammed and Noor Nisha of Tiruvarur. Since Kumaresan had objected to his son renouncing Hindu religion and embracing Islam, the parents of the girl and sought the help of Bakrudeen to kill Kumaresan so that his son could embrace Islam and also to send across a lesson in future to prevent others to marry Islam people and change them to Hinduism.   Based on the appellant's confession, four others were arrested and three long sized bill hooks were recovered. The appellant was charged for offences under the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Law Amendment Act, Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. The appellant moved for bail three times and all three petitions were rejected. The present appeal was against the third bail petition.   The appellant had contended that the allegations were false and that he was arrested merely for his active involvement in the whatsapp group namely "Indian Muslim Development Association" in Trichy. It was further submitted that the appellant was called to commissioner's office without any summon and was illegaly detained and brutally harassed. The appellant also highlighted that he did not have any antecedents.  The prosecution denied the case of false implication. It was submitted that there were materials to show that the appellant was likely to tamper evidence, if enlarged on bail. The prosecution submitted that though the appellant did not have any antecedents, the offences involved in the present case were grave and likely to incite communal violence. As per the settled law, the appellant was not entitled to bail for involvement in heinous offences.   The court noted that while considering bail application for offences falling under Chapter IV of the UAPA Act, the court had to first form an opinion as to whether there was a prima facie case against the accused.   In the present case, the court noted that the motive attributed to the appellant had two limbs, first to remove the hindrance in conversion and second to threat other section of people not to collide with Islam. These motives however could not meet at any point. The modus operandi of the appellant could have been a secret if his intention was to kill Kumaresan and would have been open if the intention was to send a message.   From the perusal of the case diary and the materials available, other than the appellants and the other accused having been arrested based on suspicion and their confession being recorded while in custody and recovery of Bill Hooks from the other accused, there is no other material to pin point that the appellant and other accused had intended to commit the murder of Kumaresan and to create terror and fear among the public and people of other section.  The court had also noted that no offence had taken place and no complaint was actually made by Kumaresan. The entire case was merely on the suspicion that arose in the mind of a police officer while doing his routine rounds. The court was therefore convinced that there was no prima facie case against the appellant.  taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case in the light of the decisions referred to above and a perusal of the case diary, this court is of the opinion that the allegations against the appellant do not fall within the definition of "Terrorist Act" and there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the appellant is prima facie true.  Thus, the court granted bail to the appellant while also emphasising that the observations made in the judgment were only with respect to the application for bail and that the special court may not be influenced by the same.

The Delhi High Court on Friday observed that the Courts have to be sensitive to the situation where allegations have been lodged by mother of a minor victim against her own husband of having sexual contact with the daughter, that too in her presence in the house. Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta made the observation while denying anticipatory bail to a husband, whose wife had alleged that he had sexually assaulted her five year old daughter.  The FIR was registered against the petitioner under sec. 377 of Indian Penal Code as well as sec. 6 of POCSO Act. Later, sec. 376AB (punishment for rape of minor under 12 years of age) of the Code was also invoked against him. The petitioner had disputed the occurrence of the incident claiming discrepancy in timings as well as past history of the matrimonial disputes. Refusing to examine such contentions at this stage, the Court said, "It cannot be ignored that the future of the victim child also gets impacted, at least in close circles and any mother would normally desist from taking the issues which may adversely affect her own child in social circles. The legal presumption as to the commission of offence and culpable mental state as legislated under POCSO Act has also to be kept in perspective while dealing with offences under POCSO Act," the Court said.  The Court also perused the statement of the minor victim recorded under sec. 164 CrPC and observed that it may be "far too stretched" to assume that the statement may have been made at the behest of complainant mother or was being used for settling the scores. It added, "In case of allegations of offences against a minor victim, the Courts have to be sensitive to their plight when faced with a situation wherein allegations have been lodged by mother of the victim against her own husband of having sexual contact with his own daughter and that too in her presence in the house."  The petitioner had argued that Section 376AB IPC could not have been directed to be invoked by the Additional Sessions Judge during the pendency of bail application. Rejecting this contention, the Court observed, "The invocation of correct section by the Investigating Agency on pointing out by the learned Additional Sessions Judge during the stage of investigation is not barred...if an error in not invoking the correct section comes to the notice of the Trial Court/MM at the stage of investigation, it cannot be deemed that the concerned judicial officer oversteps his jurisdiction in pointing out the error/deficiency though the power to invoke the relevant sections of law rests with the Investigating Agency." The petitioner had also challenged the finding of the Trial Court that it is proscribed to deal with application under Section 438 CrPC for grant of anticipatory bail in view of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2018. At the outset, the High Court noted that the Amendment was brought specifically for the welfare of women and children, keeping in view the rising crime rate. Section 438(4) barred anticipatory bail for alleged commission of offences under Sections 376(3), 376AB, 376DA and 376DB IPC. Thus it held, "In view of sub-Section (4) of Section 438 Cr.P.C., the application for anticipatory bail is not maintainable before the learned Trial Court and the observations to this extent cannot be faulted with. The legislative intention is clear and implicit in placing embargo for grant of anticipatory bail in cases referred under sub-Section (4) of Section 438 Cr.P.C." The Court went on to explain that merely because law prescribes alternate punishment, either under POCSO Act or under Section 376AB IPC, whichsoever provides for punishment greater in degree, the bar under Section 438(4) is not obliterated. It observed, "By virtue of Section 42 of POCSO Act, if the offence is punishable under POCSO Act as well as Section 376AB IPC and if the offender is found guilty of such offence, he shall be liable to punishment either under POCSO Act or under the IPC, whichsoever provides for punishment greater in degree. It cannot be inferred that the rigor of sub-Section (4) of Section 438 Cr.P.C. stands obliterated at the stage of bail since offender stands charged with both Section 376AB IPC as well as Section 6 of POCSO Act and may be punished on conviction under Section 6 of POCSO Act instead of Section 376AB IPC. The purpose of Section 42 is to ensure that an act constituting offence under two different enactments does not lead to double punishment for the same act constituting an offence" With the said observations, the anticipatory bail plea was dismissed.

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday set aside the decision of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) to dissolve the elected executive committee of Maharashtra State Wrestling Association (MSWA), led by NCP chief Sharad Pawar observing that it was "unreasonable, illegal and not in sporting spirit".  "Decision of the Executive Committee of WFI was, not only in breach of principles of natural justice, but behind their back…the procedural fairness has been given complete go-by, before taking the impugned decision", Justice Sandeep K. Shinde stated in his order.  NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had headed the MSWA committee for over 40 years, till it was dissolved by WFI on July 4, 2022. The High Court said that the elected body of the Association shall hold the office till its' tenure comes to an end and shall carry on its day-to-day functions in accordance with its Constitution.  In the petition filed last month, MSWA said that in a meeting held on June 30 WFI's national executive committee, headed by BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh Brijbhushan Sharan Singh decided to dissolve MSWA's committee citing failure to conduct certain tournaments. The decision was arbitrary, MSWA said.  The Executive Committee (EC) of WFI appointed three Members of Ad-Hoc Committee to conduct fresh election and run the day-to-day affairs of these Associations. Joint Secretary, Wrestling Federation of India was appointed as the Chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee. MSWA challenged this decision before the High Court.  The EC of WFI had reasoned that many complaints have been received against B. S. Landge, General Secretary of MSWA and the wrestlers are not getting any benefit due to mismanagement in the MSWA. Therefore, it unanimously dissolved the EC of the MSWA  The court noted that the agenda for the meeting did not contain subject to dissolve the unit members of WFI.  The court observed that MSWA was not heard and its elected Governing Council Members were not apprised of the allegations-cum-charges.  Langde was only present in the meeting as a member of the Executive Committee, the court said. The minutes of the meeting do not show material that the President of WFI relied on for dissolving MSWA was provided to Landge, the court stated.  The court further observed that local wrestlers and State officials made complaints against Mr. Landge alone, and not against other governing Council Members of MSWA  "Dissolving and superseding the elected body of Association is a harsh action and therefore the WFI ought to have afforded adequate opportunity to the elected Members of petitioner-Association before taking the decision", the court added.  The court noted that Clause (b) of Article VI, Constitution of WFI empowers the Executive Committee to impose and enforce penalty and/or to take suitable action against any member Association provided two-third majority members vote in favour of proposal and adequate opportunity of being heard is given.  "In the case at hand, leave aside, 'adequate opportunity', but not even, opportunity of being heard was given to Council Members and/or Office Bearers of the petitioner-Association", the court said.  The court said that the decision of the Executive Committee has to be ratified by the General Council; however there is nothing on record showing to show that the GC ratified the decision.  The court noted that under Article V(g) of the WFI Constitution, General Council alone has the power to appoint an ad-hoc committee. "Decision to appoint the Ad-Hoc Committee and further empowering the Ad-Hoc Committee to look after the day-to-day affairs and to hold the election of the petitioner-Association was equally illegal and bad in law", the court held.

Punjab and Haryana High Court on March 11, 2022, dismissed the plea for regular bail of the petitioner who is involved in a case of honour killing of the minor daughter.  The bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill rejected the bail plea of the petitioner and directed the Trial to be expedited.  The prosecution shall ensure the presence of the prosecution witnesses on the dates, as may be fixed by the trial Court for recording their statements so that there is no further delay in the proceedings of trial. The Trial Court may make a schedule in advance for summoning the PWs and fix short dates for the witnesses to be summoned. Special messengers be deputed for securing presence of the witnesses. If deemed necessary, a request be also be made to Senior Superintendent of Police concerned for ensuring that the presence of all the PWs is secured for the dates as may be fixed by the Trial Court."  The case came up as a result of a conspiracy between the petitioner-mother and adoptive parents of the minor daughter who hired professional killers to get their daughter killed for 'compromising their honour' by eloping with a Balmiki boy. This is the case of double murders where in the event minor daughter along with Police personnel died.  The undisputed facts of the case are that Sarita is the biological mother of the deceased-Juvenile Mamta who was given in adoption to her paternal uncle and aunt. Mamta eloped with a boy who belonged to a Balmiki caste. Her decision was not welcomed by the family and they saw it as an act of embarrassment and disgrace. They entered into a conspiracy to hire professional killers and kill Mamta.  When Mamta was produced before Juvenile Justice Board, the complainants named SI Narender and Constable Sushila were accompanying her. The professional killers came on a motorcycle and fired on Mamta. As a result of which Mamta died and SI Narendra eventually succumbed to his injuries. Therefore, the present FIR was registered on the complaint of the complainant.  Petitioner's counsel tried to carve out the possibility of motive on the part of Savita by arguing that once Savita gave away Mamta in adoption to her paternal uncle and aunt, she had nothing to do with her daughter anymore which makes Mamta's conduct not embarrassing for Savita.  On the other hand, the State counsel while pointing strongly at the motive part submitted that since the petitioner and adoptive parents were closely related, the possibility that Mamta's conduct would affect the petitioner cannot be carved out completely. It was further submitted that the alleged act of honour killing was the result of the petitioner and other co-accused feeling that their 'honour' was compromised by Mamta having an alliance with the Balmiki boy. This fact is further concreted by the co-accused who in his disclosure statement, clearly named the petitioner as one of the co-accused.  The court after hearing both the counsels and rejecting the contentions of the petitioners held that the facts stated above have been corroborated with various events do not leave any room for leniency. As far as the argument regarding parity with the case of other co-accused is concerned, the court stated that the petitioner cannot claim any benefit on stating that said accused were granted bail because they were not related to the deceased, unlike the petitioner being the biological mother and during the proceedings of the trial, two eye-witnesses have supported the prosecution case.

Justice C Hari Shankar of the Delhi High Court,taking suo-motu cognizance of what he described as an "alarming situation" on an Air India flight bound towards Delhi from Kolkata on Mar 5, has issued a slew of directions to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and commercial airlines in the country with respect to in-flight Covid-19 protocol.  In an order passed on Monday, he notes that "though all the passengers had worn masks, many passengers had worn the masks below their chin and were exhibiting a stubborn reluctance to wear their masks properly."  Justice Shankar notes that despite a search he could not trace any guidelines on the DGCA website on in-flight Covid-19 protocol and that the only guidelines he found – after an intrusive navigation on the website – were from May, 2020.  However, he said that while the court does not intend to criticise efforts by the Government authorities in trying to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic situation, "Sensitization of the citizenry has to precede, not succeed, galvanization of the governmental machinery."  He stated that, he observed the passengers' behaviour was thus, not only in the airbus but also within the flight and said that the cabin crew of the flight had shown helplessness in this regard.  Expressing concern over the fact that these passengers were blissfully ignorant until several entreaties by the judge himself to wear the masks properly, Justice Shankar highlighted in his order that closed air-conditioned environment in a flight where even one person suffers from Covid-19 can have "cataclysmic" effects and therefore, when the country is seeing a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, this behaviour is "completely unconscionable."   Therefore, the Single Judge Bench of Justice Hari Shankar proceeded to lay down guidelines to lend teeth to any existing instructions with respect to the Covid-19 protocol, directing for the same to be highlighted adequately by concerned authorities.   Inter alia, he has directed the DGCA to:  1. Prominently reflect on its main website, instructions containing Covid-19 guidelines and protocols to be followed by passengers and in-flight crew in domestic flights, by displaying them in a distinct and different font, blinking or otherwise, or by any other suitable means.   2. Consider sending random observers on flights, without prior information, to check that Covid-19 protocols are followed in flights.  He has directed the airlines to ensure:  1. Handing over of written instructions on the Covid-19 in-flight protocol including measures on non-compliance to the passengers, alongwith the Boarding Pass.  2. Due sensitisation regarding passenger responsibilities both before as well as after boarding.   3. Inflight announcements which, presently, merely require the passengers to wear masks at all times, to be modified to include a cautionary word regarding penal action in the event of default.  4. Periodical checks of the aircraft by the cabin crew to supervise that all passengers comply with the protocol, especially regarding wearing of masks. Masks should be worn as directed by governmental instructions, covering the nose and mouth, and not worn merely covering the mouth or below the chin.   5. Immediate offloading of passengers unwilling to follow this protocol prior to the flight taking off, and action against the passenger in accordance with guidelines of DGCA or Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, including placing the passenger on a "no-fly" regimen, either permanently or for a stipulated, sufficiently long period – in case the passenger refuses to comply despite reminders.  6. Strict compliance and enforcement of all penal provisions, with no relaxation whatsoever.   The court also said that relaxation, if necessary, should be allowed only in cases which are truly exceptional, such as for medical reasons, after a conscious assessment and evaluation of (a) the necessity of the passenger to fly and (b) the justifiability of the passenger's refusal to wear the mask, weighed against the risk to public interest involved if the passenger is allowed to travel  without a mask.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that the nature of service of a police official cannot be equated with the nature of any other service and a person who has been convicted of a criminal charge is definitely not fit to serve as police official/officer.  The observations were made by Justice Sanjay Dhar while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged an order passed by respondent UT of J&K, whereby the petitioner had been disengaged from the roll of Special Police Officers (SPOs) of the District Ramban.  Apart from challenging the disengagement order the petitioner also prayed for a writ of mandamus seeking directions for his appointment as constable with retrospective effect with all consequential benefits. The petitioner further sought a writ of prohibition thereby asking the respondents not to take note of the judgment dated 6th June, 2018 passed by Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Gool.  The petitioner challenged the order of disengagement mainly on the ground that in terms of Section 19 of the J&K Police Act, under which the petitioner was engaged as SPO, enjoys same powers, privileges and protection as are being enjoyed by ordinary officers of the police. On this ground, it was urged that without holding an enquiry and without issuing show cause notice to the petitioner, he could not have been discharged from service.  Secondly the petitioner argued that because co-accused person with him were re-instated in their respective services, as such, he should also be re-instated.  It was also brought to the notice of the Court that the Petitioner and co-accused were extended benefit of probation, upon conviction by the Magistrate.  Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Dhar observed that an SPO engaged under Section 18 of the J&K Police Act is not entitled to right of any hearing or enquiry, keeping in view the nature of his engagement and hence it was not incumbent upon the respondents to hold an enquiry or give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner before terminating his services as SPO.  In order to buttress the said position of law, the bench placed firm reliance on the Division bench judgement of J&K&L High Court in State of J&K v. Mohammad Iqal Mallah (LPA No.153 of 2012 decided on 05.06.2014).  Dealing with the second contention of the petitioner the bench observed,  "Even otherwise, once the petitioner was convicted of a criminal charge, even though, he was granted benefit of probation, it was open to the respondents to refuse to take him back in service, because the service of police department is not like service of any other department. A person, who has been convicted of a criminal charge is definitely not fit to serve as police official/officer not even as an SPO".  Elaborating further Justice Dhar noted that the contention of the petitioner that just because co-accused after passing of the judgment by the criminal Court were re-instated in their respective services and as such, he should also be re-instated, cannot be accepted for the nature of service of a police official cannot be equated with the nature of any other service. Thus, there has been no discrimination against the petitioner, it underscored.  Accordingly the bench found the petition without any merit and dismissed the same.

The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court recently allowed parole without police escort to gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli for attending his son's marriage. The court also decreased the amount of cash security and surety imposed on him.  The division bench of Justice Vinay Joshi and Justice Vrushali V. Joshi partially allowed a writ petition filed by Gawli observing that the authority has not given any reason for imposing the condition of police escort and large amount of cash security and surety while granting parole.  The petitioner was convicted under sections 302 and 120-B of the IPC and provisions of section 3 of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act. He applied for special parole under Rule 19(2) of the Maharashtra Prison (Mumbai Furlough and Parole) Rules 1959 for attending marriage of his son to be held on 17 November 2022 at Mumbai.  Deputy Inspector General (Prisons)(East) Nagpur limited the duration of special parole granted to the petitioner to 4 days including the travel period. Further, the parole was granted with police escort and Rs 5 lakh cash security and surety of the same amount. The petitioner approached the High Court challenging the limited duration of parole along with the condition of police escort and the high amount of security.  The petitioner's case was that he has undergone imprisonment of approximately 14 years and has never committed any anti-social activity or had any offence registered against him during this period. He has been granted parole/furlough 12 times during his imprisonment and abided with all conditions and has surrendered on due date without delay on each occasion.  The state in its reply justified the parole conditions on the basis of adverse police report and the petitioner being involved in a number of criminal activities. Further, special parole for four days including traveling period with provision of extension of next 4 days was granted in view of amendment in Rule 19(2) of the 1959 Rules.  The court perused the amended notification of Rule 19(2) of the 1959 Rules which provides for restricted time span of parole. Advocate M. N. Ali for the petitioner waived the submission for 15 days parole and conceded that as per amended Rule 19(2) special parole would be for 4 days only with provision of extension.  APP S. M. Ukey for the state referred to the report of Additional Commissioner of Police to justify the police escort. As per the report, the petitioner has rivalry with others gangs involved in criminal activities and hence there is a threat to his life. Ukey said that appropriate quantum of surety has been fixed to ensure timely return of the petitioner.  Advocate Ali argued that the condition of police escort was not imposed in the past 12 occasions where the petitioner has been granted parole or furlough despite the same reasons having been cited by the authority. He further said that security was about Rs. 15000 with the same amount as surety in all earlier occasions of parole/furlough.  The court noted that according to the ACP report, 46 offences have been registered against the petitioner but all the offences were prior to his incarceration. "No special reasons have been quoted as to this time what are the compelling circumstances which have weighed to the authority in anticipating life threat to the petitioner", the court observed. The court noted that the impugned order does not provide reasons for ordering police escort. Therefore, the court concluded that the condition of police escort is not justified  The court further observed that the cash security of Rs. 5 lakh along with surety of equal amount has been imposed on the petitioner without providing any reason. "Imposition of heavy security would ultimately amounts to deprivation of availing the parole which if he is otherwise entitled", the court stated.   The court modified the parole order setting aside the condition of police escort and reduced the amount of security to Rs. 1 lakh cash security with the same amount in surety.

The Madras High Court recently held that when an assessment order is quashed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on technical grounds, the same cannot be made a ground to evade criminal prosecution before the concerned court under the Income Tax Act.  Justice G Chandrasekharan was considering a plea filed by cine actor SJ Suryah for quashing the prosecutions against him before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (E.O.I) Chennai, Alikulam Road on the ground that the Income Tax Appellate Authority had set aside the assessment order against him. The court observed that the the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal disposed the appeals only on the ground of limitation and not on merits. From the complaint allegation it was clear that despite, giving notice, statutory notice as detailed in the complaint, petitioner has not filed return, paid advance tax and tax demanded, suppressed the real and true income by not filing the return in time. These matters had to be necessarily tried before the Court as the violations were liable to be prosecuted for the offences under Section 276 C (1), 276 C (2), 276 CC and 277 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Facts of the Case  The Petitioner/accused Mr SJ Suryah, a cine actor and Director deriving income from remuneration for acting in movies and also directing movies had suppressed taxable income during the assessment years assessment years 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 2009-10. On account of failure to file return of income, a complaint was registered against the actor under Section 276 CC of Income Tax Act, 1961 before the EOCC Court . Aggrieved by the same, the actor had moved batch of pleas challenging the prosecution initiated by the Department before the special court for income tax cases. Contentions of the Petitioner The following were the contention of the Petitioner i)the complaint is pre-mature, when the proceedings before the department are yet to conclude and reach finality. ii)The assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer, confirmed by the CIT (A) have been set aside by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal declaring the Assessment orders as null and void.  iii)the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal makes it clear that the petitioner is not liable to pay any tax penalty or interest that could be chargeable or imposable under the Income Tax Act by the department.  iv)When that be the case, and when there is no tax, penalty or interest chargeable or imposable under the Act, prosecution under Section 276 C (1) of the Act, cannot be sustained.  v)when there is no tax, penalty or interest payable by the petitioner, the allegation of attempting to evade payment of such tax, penalty or interest under Section 276 C (2) of the Act, cannot be sustained.  vi)No prosecution under Section 276 CC of the Act, could be initiated for non  filing income tax return when the tax that could have become payable is less than Rs.3000/-. In this case, petitioner would not be liable to be pay even a rupee and therefore, prosecution under Section 276 CC cannot be maintained.  vii)Filing of false statement of verification cannot be sustained in this case as the petitioner had not filed any return of income or has made a statement which could be called as false.  Contentions of the Respondents These complaints have been filed as an offshoot of survey and search proceedings. But for the survey and search proceedings, the violations committed by the petitioner would not have come to light and it would have resulted in suppression of income and loss of revenue to the Government. These petitions have been filed mainly on the reason that Income Tax Appellate Tribunal have held assessments are null and void. However, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has not adjudicated or given a finding on any of the grounds raised in the complaint. The order was passed solely on technical ground that the assessments were time barred. When the order was not passed on merits or grounds raised in the criminal complaint, the quashing of the proceedings cannot be prayed. It has been consistently held by the Courts that order of assessment by the Appellate authority, will not be a bar for criminal prosecution, especially when no finding was given by the Appellate Authority on the merits of the case. When the ingredients of offence are clearly made out in the complaint to establish that the accused has committed the offence, the complaint cannot be quashed. Observations by the Court Essentially, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal disposed the appeals only on the ground of limitation and not on merits. It is further observed that other grounds relating to merits become an academic exercise, meaning that other issues raised in the complaint, especially the allegations raised in the complaints with regard to non filing of return of income, non payment of advance tax, non payment of the tax demanded, suppression of true and correct income by not filing return of income had not been considered by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. When the matter was not decided on merits, but only on technical ground of limitation, this Court is of the considered view, on the basis of the principles settled in Radheshyam Kejriwal Vs. State of West Bengal and another (2011) 3 SCC 581, that petitioner cannot seek to quash the proceedings in E.O.C.C.Nos.101, 102, 103, 104, 105 of 2015 on the ground that Income Tax Appellate Tribunal had set aside the assessment orders. When it comes to quashing a criminal proceedings, it is very well settled that uncontroverted averments in the complaint without any addition or subtraction should be looked into to examine whether an offence can be made out are not. If that yardstick is applied in this case, this Court is of the considered view that respondent/complainant made out prima-facie case to proceed against the petitioner for the offences alleged in the complaint. Section 278 (e) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, empowers the Court to presume culpable mental state of the accused, unless, the accused shows that he had no such mental state with respect to the act charged as an offence in the prosecution. In this view of the matter, this Court finds that petitioner shall necessarily face the trial. Case Title: SJ Suryah v.

In a significant observation, the Allahabad High Court today observed that the disregard shown by the senior-most officials to the orders passed by the Court has grave consequences on the rule of law in the country. The Bench of Justice Ajay Bhanot further remarked that it has repeatedly noticed the failure of the police authorities to provide instructions to the learned Government Advocate of bail applications from time to time. "Once the police authorities have been alerted to the fact that there failure to provide instructions in time strikes at the root of law. It often leads to unjustified incarceration of an accused in jail," the Court added. "The disregard shown by the senior-most officials to the orders passed by the Court has grave consequences on the rule of law in the country." : #AllahabadHighCourt #RuleOfLaw pic.twitter.com/Mkr2GxDBwD— Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) June 10, 2021 The matter before the Court A first information report was lodged against the applicant under Section 394 IPC and the bail application of the applicant was rejected by the Special Judge (Dacoity Affected Area)/Additional Sessions Judge, Auraiya, on March 2, 2021. Approaching the High Court with his Bail Application, the Counsel for the applicant contended that the applicant had been falsely implicated in the instant case and that the F.I.R. was lodged seven days after the incident.  It was argued that the delay is fatal to the case of the prosecution and the applicant was not named in the F.I.R and there are no independent witnesses to the recovery and that False recovery of some articles has been shown from the applicant.  The A.G.A could not satisfactorily dispute the aforesaid submissions from the record and he stated that he does not have any instructions from the police authorities who failed to provide instructions to the learned A.G.A. despite ample time being given for the same. Court's observations and order To this, the Court said that it has repeatedly noticed the failure of the police authorities to provide instructions to the learned Government Advocate of bail applications from time to time. The Court also noted that it was assured by the learned A.G.A. in Criminal Misc. Bail Application no. 19839 of 2021, that the State Government was committed to upholding the rule of law in the State even it is taken on its face value.  However, the Court added: "This repeated deviation merely reflects aberrations in the system and faults on the part of individual officials who need to be appropriately counselled in this regard. It is hoped that expeditious steps are being taken by the police authorities for compliance of the directions given to the Director General of Police, U.P. Police in the above said case."  Further, the Court directed that a copy of the order be served upon the Director-General of Police, U.P. Police through a Government Advocate.  Importantly, the Court said: "Courts have taken notice of the overcrowding of jails during the current pandemic situation. These circumstances shall also be factored in while considering bail applications on behalf of accused persons." Further, looking at the merit in the submissions of the counsel for the applicant and accordingly holding that the applicant is entitled to be enlarged on bail, the Court allowed the bail application on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court below.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday held that considering the abatement in the Covid-19 pandemic and the reopening of schools across the State, its earlier direction stipulating 20 percent reduction in fees charged by private schools would cease to exist from February 16, 2022 onwards with regards to physical classes.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday held that considering the abatement in the Covid-19 pandemic and the reopening of schools across the State, its earlier direction stipulating 20 percent reduction in fees charged by private schools would cease to exist from February 16, 2022 onwards with regards to physical classes.  The Court observed that schools and other educational institutions shall be permitted to charge fees according to their policy and arrangement with the students from February 16, 2022 onwards.  A Bench comprising Justice IP Mukherji and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya was adjudicating upon a bunch of PILs filed by aggrieved parents seeking a partial remission of school fees for the session 2021-2022 due to the ongoing pandemic owing to which students are attending schools only through virtual mediums. The Bench vide its order dated October 13, 2020, had slashed the fees charged by private schools in the State by 20% due to the ongoing pandemic. On Friday, the Court observed,  "With prospective effect from 16th February, 2022, that part of our order permitting deduction of 20% of school fees shall stand vacated." The Bench further opined that considering the substantial remission of the effects of the pandemic, its previously issued interim order must be modified and accordingly remarked further,  "As the situation stands today, there is substantial remission of the effects of the pandemic. Life in all spheres has become substantially normal. In fact by the notification of the State Government dated 14th February, 2022, even primary and upper primary schools have been thrown open to physical education with effect from 16th February, 2022. Therefore, from now, education in all the schools and other educational institutions covered by this public interest litigation would be physical." Pertinently, the Court further observed that up to February 28, 2022 with regards to online classes, students will have to pay school fees according to the interim order previously issued by the Court.  Furthermore, the Court underscored that until March 31, 2022 or until further orders no coercive action can be taken against any student by educational institutions for non-payment of school fees.  "Till 31st March, 2022 or until further orders, whichever is earlier, no coercive action like expulsion of any student from the school, withholding of admit card to sit for any Board or school examination, withholding of mark-sheets or certificates on the ground of default in payment of school fees, shall be taken by the schools or other educational institutions covered by this litigation against any student", the Court directed.  Directions Issued  (a) With prospective effect from 16th February, 2022, that part of our order permitting deduction of 20% of school fees shall stand vacated. (b) The schools and other educational institutions shall be permitted to charge fees according to their policy and arrangement with the students. (c) Up to 28th February, 2022, subject to (d) below students shall pay the school fees according to the interim orders made by us prior to this day, for online classes. (d) In case of any dispute between the school fees claimed and the school fees payable according to a student for the period up to today, 50% (fifty per cent) of the demand by the school or the admitted amount by the student, whichever is higher, has to be paid without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in this litigation, by 15th March, 2022. Our earlier interim order with regard to payment of the disputed amount stands modified to this extent. The matter is slated to be heard next on March 25.  Case Title: Rajib Chakraborty and Ors v. The State of West Bengal and Ors    
The Kerala High Court has recently held that mere reference of a party for settlement under Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure would not entitle refund of court fee as provided under Section 69A of the Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, unless it has been settled between the parties.  Justice A. Badharudeen held that although settlement of disputes dealt under Section 89 of CPC includes `arbitration' as well, a party is not entitled to get a refund of the court fee merely because they were referred to arbitration under Section 69 of the Act. "Section 69A of the Act makes the position without any iota of doubt that refund of court fee is provided only when a court proceeding is settled by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C and refund is not permissible on the mere reference of parties. Thus it is clear that mere reference of parties by different modes of settlement provided under Section 89 of C.P.C is not sufficient to refund the entire court fee paid as contended, and the statutory mandate is settlement of the dispute by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C." The petitioner was the plaintiff in a suit before the Additional Sub Court. He approached the High Court seeking modification of the Sub Judge's order referring the parties for arbitration after closing the suit, without an order for a refund of 1/10th court fee paid by him in the suit. Advocates Shibu Joseph and Ajith Viswanathan appearing for the petitioner argued that he had paid 1/10 court fee at the time of institution of the suit and that since the parties were referred to arbitration, he is entitled to get a return of the same. It was submitted that there is no direct provision in the Act enabling the return of 1/10 court fee paid but emphasis was laid on Section 69A of the Act to canvass this refund, apart from Section 89 of CPC. The petitioner added that there was no decision on this point.  The Court noted that a plain reading of Section 69A would make it clear that when a proceeding before any court is settled by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C, the whole court fee paid shall be refunded except in interlocutory matters. Thus it was clear that Section 69A of the Act would come into play only when the case is settled by recourse to Section 89 of C.P.C. Further, the proviso to Section 69 states that no refund shall be ordered where only one-tenth of the amount of fee on plaint has been paid by the parties.  The petitioner had also relied on Manilal Panicker S. v. Titto Abraham to contend that where a compromise or settlement has been arrived at the Lok Adalat in a case referred to it, the entire court fee paid shall be refunded in the manner provided under Central Court Fees Act. However, the Court pointed out that it has been held specifically that the right to refund the court fee, by virtue of Section 21 of Legal Services Authorities Act would accrue only on settlement or compromise. "Be it so, it cannot be said that mere reference of parties for arbitration or other modes of settlement provided under Section 89 of C.P.C by itself is sufficient to refund the court fee paid by the parties, either in full or 1/10 or 1/3, as the case may be. There shall be a settlement in view of the reference and in such cases alone refund provided under Section 69A of the Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act can be resorted to." The Judge noted that the petitioner had not produced any materials to substantiate the fact that on reference to arbitration, the dispute was settled. Therefore, the petition was dismissed, finding no fault with the order of the Munsiff in any manner.  Case Title: K.K Ibrahim v. Cochin Kaagaz   
The Supreme Court of India, while enlarging on bail an undertrial prisoner who was arrested seven years ago under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 for his alleged involvement in peddling a prohibited substance, observed that a plain and literal interpretation of the rigorous conditions under Section 37 would make granting of bail impossible.A division bench of Justices... The Supreme Court of India, while enlarging on bail an undertrial prisoner who was arrested seven years ago under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 for his alleged involvement in peddling a prohibited substance, observed that a plain and literal interpretation of the rigorous conditions under Section 37 would make granting of bail impossible. A division bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta held, “A plain and literal interpretation of the conditions under Section 37 would effectively exclude grant of bail altogether, resulting in punitive detention and unsanctioned preventive detention as well.” Section 37, as the judgement explains in some detail, “curtails the right of an accused to secure bail, and correspondingly fetters judicial discretion". Under this provision, the Court can grant bail to an accused only on being satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are not guilty of such an offence and that the accused is also unlikely to commit any offence after being released from jail.  The bench, in the judgement authored by Justice Bhat, noted that the apex court had upheld such restrictive conditions for in view of the balance between the two competing values, namely, the right of an accused to enjoy freedom, based on the presumption of innocence, and the interest of the society at large. However, it also conceded that the only manner is which the special condition in provisions such as the one contained in Section 37 of the NDPS Act could be considered within constitutional parameters is by relying on a prima facie determination of the case based on the material available on the record. The bench categorically stated that any other interpretation would result in complete denial of bail to a person accused of offences such as those enacted under Section 37 of the NDPS Act. It held: “The only manner in which such special conditions as enacted under Section 37 can be considered within constitutional parameters is where the court is reasonably satisfied on a prima facie look at the material on record (whenever the bail application is made) that the accused is not guilty. Any other interpretation would result in complete denial of the bail to a person accused of offences such as those enacted under Section 37 of the NDPS Act.” "The standard to be considered therefore, is one, where the court would look at the material in a broad manner, and reasonably see whether the accused’s guilt may be proved" The Court further said : "The court would look at the material in a broad manner, and reasonably see whether the accused’s guilt may be proved. The judgments of this court have emphasised that the satisfaction which courts are expected to record, i.e., that the accused may not be guilty, is only prima facie, based on a reasonable reading, which does not call for meticulous examination of the materials collected during investigation.” This observation was made by the bench even as it noted that the apex court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Kajad [(2001) 7 SCC 673] had said that a ‘liberal’ approach should not be taken with respect to Section 37 of the NDPS Act. The appellant’s claim for bail, the bench stated, must be considered “within the framework of the NDPS Act, especially Section 37”.  The court however, added that the restrictive conditions in special acts have been upheld on the condition that the trial is concluded expeditiously. “When stringent provisions are enacted, curtailing the provisions of bail, and restricting judicial discretion, it is on the basis that investigation and trials would be concluded swiftly,” the bench said. In this connection, the bench relied on Satender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of Investigation  (SC) 577 in which the top court said that Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires, inter alia, the accused to be enlarged on bail if the trial is not concluded within specified periods, is also applicable to special acts.    “The appellant has been in custody for over 7 years and 4 months. The progress of the trial has been at a snail’s pace: 30 witnesses have been examined, whereas 34 more have to be examined,” the bench noted while holding that bail cannot be denied to an accused charged with offences under the NDPS Act owing to the operation of Section 37 when there has been an undue delay in the trial. This appeal had arisen out of a case involving the supply of ganja, in which four of the appellant’s co-accused were found to be in possession of more than a hundred kilograms of the prohibited substance and the appellant, one Mohd. Muslim, was subsequently implicated on the basis of the confessional statement of one of the co-accused. The court noted that the appellant was only 23 years old at the time of his arrest. The matter travelled in appeal to the top court after the Delhi High Court rejected his application for regular bail.

In light of Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 the Uttarakhand High Court noted that any person, who is apparently a child, shall be entitled to be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a probation officer or under the care of any fit person.

In light of Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 the Uttarakhand High Court noted that any person, who is apparently a child, shall be entitled to be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a probation officer or under the care of any fit person.  Justice R.C. Khulbe noted that the distinction between bailable or non-bailable offense has been done away with in respect of a juvenile. He observed, "In other words, every juvenile is entitled to be released on bail except in circumstances where his/her release will bring him/her into association with any known criminal or expose him/her to moral, physical or psychological danger or that his release would defeat the ends of justice. As per the Section 2 (12) of the Act, 'child' means a person who has not completed eighteen years of age." A criminal revision was preferred against an order of the Juvenile Justice Board and the judgment of the Special Judge POCSO which dismissed the bail of the juvenile accused considering the gravity of the offences. The juvenile accused, a 17-year-old, was alleged in a case under Section 304, 338, 177, and 201 of the Indian Penal Code.  As per the FIR, the juvenile accused was driving the offending vehicle. On the said issue, the Court noted that it is a matter of evidence whether the case falls within the definition of Section 304A IPC of Section 304 IPC.  The Court noted that as per Section 12 of the Act, the bail can be refused if there appears reasonable ground for believing that the release is likely to bring that person into association with any 'known criminal'. It emphasized that the Parliament has not used 'known' without purpose. By using the word 'known,' the Parliament requires that the Court know the full particulars of the criminal with whom the delinquent is likely to come into the association.  "In the case in hand, there is no such evidence on record regarding the same; both the impugned orders are silent about it; the bail of the delinquent was rejected simply on the ground that the offence is heinous in nature while Section 12 of the Act is silent about it," the Court added. The Court thus allowed the criminal revision, setting aside the impugned order and releasing the juvenile on bail.  Case Title: Ayaan Ali v. The State of Uttarakhand  Read The Order     
The Delhi High Court has said that Delhi Government's decision to restrict the total number of visits by family members, relatives, friends and legal advisers with jail inmates to two times a week, keeping in view the number of undertrials and prisoners, cannot be said to be arbitrary.  A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the decision has been taken after “careful consideration” of the facilities available in jails, availability of the staff and the number of undertrials.  The court disposed of a public interest litigation moved by two advocates challenging Rule 585 of the Delhi Prison Rules, 2018. It also sought amendment of the Rules to include interview with legal advisers be open from Monday to Friday for an appropriate allotted time with no cap on interviews per week.  Rule 585 states that every prisoner shall be allowed reasonable facilities for seeing or communicating with his family members, relatives, friends and legal advisers for preparation of an appeal, procuring bail or for arranging management of his property and family affairs.  It was the petitioners’ case that limiting the number of visits to twice a week is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as it limits the right of an undertrial to have adequate resources to legal representation.  The petitioners’ submitted that fixing a cap on number of visits to an undertrial is manifestly arbitrary as it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the right to legal representation and violates right to access justice.   On the other hand, the Delhi Government in its response submitted that the decision to cap the number of visits was taken after looking at the number of inmates in jails in the national capital. It states that 16 Jails in Delhi are housing more than 18,000 prisoners against the sanctioned capacity of 10,026.  The government also submitted that providing two legal interviews to a prisoner can be increased on request of the inmate or a visiting counsel and it does not fall foul of the constitutional right of the prisoner.  Reliance was also placed on Model Prison Manual, 2016 and the Prison Rules of other states to contend that prisoners are not allowed visitation for more than twice a week outside Delhi as well. The bench observed that in matters of policy, courts do not substitute their own conclusion with that of the government merely because another view is possible. However, the court also said that the PIL is not an adversarial litigation as it was filed in the interest of prisoners. It permitted the petitioners to give a representation to the Delhi Government by providing suggestions. The court added that it expects the government to consider the representation “in the right spirit.” “Depending upon the number of undertrials and prisoners, the State has taken a decision of capping total number of visits by family members, relatives, friends and legal advisers to two times a week and it cannot be said that the said decision is completely arbitrary. The said decision has been taken after careful consideration of the facilities available in the prisons, availability of the staff and the number of undertrials,” the court said.  Title: JAI A. DEHADRAI AND ANR v. GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI AND ANR    
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently awarded compensation of Rs 30.2 lakhs to a five-year-old boy disabled for life by 33,000 KV HT line laid by the Power Development Department (PDD). The liability for negligence cast upon the functionaries of the State would lie within the parameters of "strict liability" under law of Torts, the Court reiterated.  The Minor had come in direct contact with live 33000 KV HT line passing through adjacent to his residential house. The installation was said to have been made despite objections raised by the inhabitants of the village, including the minor's father. He approached the court seeking Rs. 1.22 crores compensation.   The victim submitted that as a consequence of negligence shown by the respondents he suffered severe burn injuries on account of electrocution and was operated on a number of times resulting in amputation of his right hand, thumb of the left hand, finger of right foot, besides burnt injuries to the whole body. The disability was assessed by the Medical Board to the extent of 90% Permanent in nature.  State on the other hand claimed the victim got electrocuted due to his own negligence while playing with some metallic object on his 3rd storied residential house, as confirmed by the locals of the area.  Dealing with the matter Justice Wani noted that father of the victim had constructed 3rd storey of his residential house in close proximity of the HT line in question having been laid in the year 2012. It observed that it was incumbent and obligatory for the respondents under Jammu and Kashmir Electricity Act, 2010 read with Jammu and Kashmir Electricity Rules 1978 to have not permitted construction of 3rd storey in close proximity of HT line.  "The said assertion of the respondents 1 to 4 is not based on any proof or documentary evidence supporting the said assertion. The said assertion is stated to be based on the version of the locals whose particulars even have not been provided in the objections" the court added.  Expounding on the Strict Liability Principle applicable to the instant case the bench placed firm reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in Mc Mehta Vs Union of India 1987 where it was held,  "Where an enterprise is engaged in a hazardous and inherently dangerous activity and harm is caused on anyone on account of the accident in operation of the such activity, the enterprise is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate those who get affected by the accident and such liability is not subject to any of the exceptions to the principle of strict liability under the rule contained in Rylands Vs. Fletcher".  Finally, the Court directed the respondents to pay an amount of Rs. 30,20,000/- (with interest) to the victim by depositing the same in a Fixed Deposit Account.  "Monthly interest that would be earned on the aforesaid amount of compensation during the period of minority of the victim petitioner shall be withdrawn by the father of the victim petitioner and spend upon victim petitioner as monthly expenses including treatment", the bench concluded.

The Kerala High Court held that the head of the educational institution would be held liable if any tourist bus, which does not meet the safety standards and standards prescribed in relation to control of noise, is used in any public place for carrying students from that educational institution. "In case any contract carriage, which does not meet the safety standards and the standards prescribed in relation to control of noise is used in any public place for carrying students from any educational institutions, the head of that educational institution and also the teacher or teachers, who are in charge of that trip, who are least bothered about the safety of the students, shall also be proceeded against, in accordance with law," said the court. The division bench comprising Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice P G Ajithkumar also said the entry of any contract carriage or other motor vehicles violating the safety standards or noise control norms or those with unauthorised alterations shall not be permitted in the premises of any educational institution in the State for any purpose including exhibition or auto show. "Any such activity shall be prevented by the head of that educational institution, which shall also be reported to the concerned Station House Officer and also the Enforcement Officer in the Motor Vehicles Department, so as to enable them to proceed against the owner and driver of such vehicles," said the court. In a pending matter related to the road safety, the court last week took Suo Motu note of the Wadakkanchery bus accident in which a contract carriage carrying students, who were on a study tour, met with an accident and hit the rear of a KSRTC bus. Nine people including five students and one teacher were killed in the accident. After pursuing the accident investigation report of the case, the court said the contract carriage vehicle carrying the students was fitted with unauthorised lights, speakers and window curtains. "The driver cabin was fitted with continuously blinking DJ rotating LED lights, multi-coloured LED/laser/neon lights in the passenger compartment, converting the passenger compartment into a dancing floor, causing distraction to the driver of that vehicle and also to other road users," noted the bench. The court has further directed the Enforcement Officers of Motor Vehicles Department and the State Police to take strict action against the contract carriers which violate the laws and prescribed norms. Suspend fitness certificate of such vehicles, mere removal of unauthorised fittings not enough; driivng license also to be suspended When the matter was taken up on Monday, the Court, after considering the materials on record and the submissions made by the Deputy Solicitor General of India, Special Government Pleader and Senior Government Pleader said: "...we find that a total prohibition on the use of contract carriages violating the safety standards prescribed in AIS-008/AIS- 052(Rev.1) 2008 and also the standards prescribed in relation to control of noise, is highly essential since plying of such vehicles on public place is posing threat to the safety of the passengers in those vehicles, and also other road users." However, the court added that the procedure of permitting use of such vehicles after interception, with a direction to produce the vehicle for inspection within one week after removing such unauthorised fittings, cannot be permitted to continue as the same is flagrant violation of the statutory provisions.  "A mere removal of unauthorised fittings in a contract carriage, without completely removing the additional wiring and other alterations made in the bus body, passenger compartment and driver cabin cannot make that vehicle as one, which complies with the provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder for the purpose of grant of Certificate of Fitness," said the court. The Court also said the bus body, passenger compartment and driver cabin of a contract carriage have to be maintained as per the statutory requirements in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules and Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules.  The Fitness Certificate of contract carriages has to be suspended with immediate effect for a period of three months if the contract carriage is found to be flouting the statutory requirements under the Motor Vehicles Rules, said the court, adding that the owner of the vehicle can be directed to make the changes as per the requirements of the law within that period. Palakkad Accident : Kerala High Court Cracks Whip On Tourist Buses With Illegal Alterations & YouTube Vloggers Promoting Such Vehicles The Court also said the driving licence of drivers who drive such contract carriage in public places has to be suspended for a period of three months for a period of three months. The Court has also said that stringent action ought to be taken against owners and drivers of contract carriages or other transport vehicles used in public places after tampering with speed governors. It has further directed the Enforcement Officers in the Motor Vehicles Department and State Police to conduct periodic inspections during the daytime and night hours to ensure that no contract carriages or other transport vehicles are used in public places flouting the safety standards and the standards prescribed in relation to control of noise.  Further, the Court has ordered that any contract carriage or other transport vehicles used in public places flouting the safety standards should be dealt with appropriately by initiating a prosecution, and such vehicles should be produced before the Jurisdictional Magistrate Court colour photographs and video of the bus body, passenger compartment, driver cabin and also luggage compartment The Court also has directed the Transport Commissioner and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to take necessary steps to ensure that videos promoting rash use of motor vehicles are not being uploaded in 'YouTube' and other online platforms. Last Week, a Single Judge Bench consisting of Justice Devan Ramachandran observed that recklessness on the wheel will not be tolerated and directed the Transport Commissioner to ensure strict enforcement of law on the roads to send a stern message to all the drivers that they will be held accountable for their actions. The matter has been posted for 14th October for further consideration. Case Title: Suo Motu v. State of Kerala & Ors.  
Punjab and Haryana High Court while dealing with a revision petition against the order passed by the Family Court, allowing respondent's application seeking DNA test to determine the paternity of the petitioner's child in response to her maintenance petition, held that since the marriage is disputed by the respondent, order of DNA test to determine paternity is not warranted.  The petitioner, on the basis of evidence which she chooses to lead has to establish her marriage as the same is being disputed by the respondent.   The bench comprising Justice Suvir Sehgal further added that determining the paternity of the child is not the moot question in the instant case where the factum of marriage itself is disputed by the respondent.  The petitioner, on the basis of evidence which she chooses to lead has to establish her marriage as the same is being disputed by the respondent. This Court therefore, is of the opinion that determining the paternity of the child is not the moot point.  In the instant case, the petitioner claimed maintenance from the respondent alleging that she is his legally wedded wife and a child was born out of the wedlock. No claim was raised on behalf of the minor. Therefore, the court opined that the petitioner should establish her marriage first because the same is being disputed by the respondent.   Court further considered the judgement in Dipanwita Roy Versus Ronobroto Roy 2014 (4) RCR (Civil) 724 wherein it was held that if the direction to hold DNA test to determine the paternity of the child can be avoided, then it should be avoided so that the legitimacy of a child is not put to peril.  As far as the judgement in Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik Versus Lata Nandlal Badwaik and another (2014) 2 SCC 576, is concerned, the court held that the facts in both the cases are totally different. Therefore, the reliance placed on this judgement by the counsel for the respondent cannot be accepted.  In view of the above discussion, this Court allowed the petition and concluded that the order passed by the Family Court directing the petitioner to undergo a blood test is not warranted in the facts and circumstances of the present case. Consequently, impugned order cannot be sustained.  Case Title : Smt. Satya Roopa Sinha v. Sarwan Kumar Mehto   
While setting aside an administrative decision of the State Government to convert a Hindi Medium school to an English Medium school, the Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday examined the question as to whether the right to get education in mother tongue or in the Hindi language is a fundamental right or not. Essentially, the Bench of Justice Dinesh Mehta was dealing with a plea filed by... While setting aside an administrative decision of the State Government to convert a Hindi Medium school to an English Medium school, the Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday examined the question as to whether the right to get education in mother tongue or in the Hindi language is a fundamental right or not.  Essentially, the Bench of Justice Dinesh Mehta was dealing with a plea filed by the School Development Management Committee of a Jodhpur-based school which challenged the policy decision of the government converting petitioners' Hindi Medium school to an English Medium School.  The case in brief  The case relates to Shri Hari Singh Sr. Sec. School, Pilwa, that has been functioning in village Pilwa (Jodhpur) since 1980 and has been catering to the educational needs of about 600 children from all sects including girls residing in such village and nearby villages.   The medium of instruction in the school was 'Hindi' since its inception, however, the Director, Secondary Education in September 2021, permitted/sanctioned conversion of 345 Government Schools to Mahatma Gandhi Government Schools (English medium), which included the name of the present school also.  Challenging this decision of the State Government, the School Development Management Committee moved to the High Court.  Court's observations   In light of the factual matrix of the case, the Court, at the outset, framed 5 questions, one of them being Whether Right To Get Education In Mother Tongue Or Hindi Is A Fundamental Right. Importantly, the Other 4 questions have been dealt with in this article  Read more about it here: "English As A Medium of Instruction Can't Be Thrusted Upon A Child Even By A Legislation Much Less By A Policy Decision": Rajasthan High Court  At the outset, the Court stressed that the right to get education in a particular language is relatable to Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution (freedom of speech and expression) and that a child, or on his behalf, his parent(s), have the right to choose the language in which his/their child should be imparted education.   In this regard, the Court also referred to Apex Court's Judgment in the case of State of Karnataka & Anr. Vs. Associated Management of English Medium Primary & Secondary Schools & Ors. (2014) 9 SCC 485, wherein it was specifically held that the right to have education in mother tongue or in a particular medium is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.  However, the Court did clarify that being a right guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (a), the right to have education in mother tongue or in a particular medium shall be subject to reasonable restriction, as per clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.  Therefore, the court opined that the State can very well prescribe a medium of instruction considering the overall development of the child and Socioeconomic factors.  Against this backdrop, the Court, having analyzed the facts of the case, concluded that the Rajasthan Government's policy decision was purely administrative in nature, and not any law and also, it cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction for the purposes mentioned in clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution.  Right to Education Act  Importantly, referring to the Right to Education Act, the Court also observed that the right of having elementary education in mother tongue is also a statutory right conferred by section 29 (2)(f) of the Act of 2009, according to which medium of instruction, as far as practicable, is required to be in child's mother tongue.  In this regard, the Court also observed that the power to frame laws in the subject of education falls in the concurrent list of the VII Schedule of the Constitution of India, and since the RTE Act deals with Education and prescribes that the medium of instructions in elementary education as far as practicable, be in mother tongue/home language of the child, therefore, the Court added, any law made or framed by the State but for the assent of the President would be repugnant by virtue of Article 254 of the Constitution.  In this regard, the Court averred thus:  "In the opinion of this Court, English, as a medium of instruction cannot be thrusted upon a child even by a legislation enacted by the State Government, much less by a policy decision."  Summing it up all, the Court concluded that the instant decision taken by the State Government or the State's policy decision should be quashed and set aside as it can't whittle down the fundamental right of a child to be taught in a particular medium, which is assured rather protected by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. Case Title: School Development Management Committee, Shri Hari Singh Senior Secondary School and Ors v. State Of Rajasthan and Anr   
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has reiterated that once a person enters into wedlock and decides to raise a family, he cannot turn around and say that he is not ready to perform his moral and legal obligation flowing out of the wedlock as he is in no mood to earn livelihood.  A bench of Justice Vinod Chatterji Koul relied on Vikram Jamwal v. Geetanjali Rajput and another (2010) 1 JKJ 236 and observed,  "It is for the person to decide to marry or not to marry, but once a person decides to marry, he is duty bound to perform all the duties and discharge all obligations that the society and law expect and require him to discharge".  The bench was hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the order of Principal Sessions Judge as a Revisional Court, upholding the order passed by the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate which awarded maintenance to his wife and daughter (living separately from him).  The petitioner argued that the impugned mechanically fixed quantum of maintenance at an exorbitant rate without taking into consideration his liabilities, which after making all necessary deductions is around Rs. 12000/- only. He also submitted that he is ready to take care of their expenses, provided they join his company.  Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Koul observed that it is settled law that the nature of duty cast on a person to maintain his wife, child/children and parents that sufficient means has been interpreted to include capacity to earn and as long as a person is able bodied with capacity to earn, he cannot escape his legal duty to maintain his wife, children and parents, who are unable to maintain themselves, on the ground that he does not actually have any income.  The Court also noted that the Petitioner had himself refused to take the respondents back and thus, they have sufficient ground for residing separately from the petitioner.  Accordingly, the petition was found without any merit and was accordingly dismissed.  Case Title : Shashi Paul Singh Vs Gurmeet Paul & Anr.              
The Kerala High Court recently held that when a Medical Board opines that the termination of pregnancy may result in a live baby and that the foetal abnormalities diagnosed are not lethal, in the absence of any threat to the mother's life or health, her reproductive choice will have to give way to the right of the unborn to be born.Justice P.B Suresh Kumar while dismissing the... The Kerala High Court recently held that when a Medical Board opines that the termination of pregnancy may result in a live baby and that the foetal abnormalities diagnosed are not lethal, in the absence of any threat to the mother's life or health, her reproductive choice will have to give way to the right of the unborn to be born. Justice P.B Suresh Kumar while dismissing the petition seeking termination of a 31-week pregnancy remarked that the unborn has life from the stage it transforms into foetus, and that there is absolutely no reason to treat an unborn child differently from a born child. "An unborn child has a life of its own and rights of its own and the rights of unborn are recognised by law. No doubt, only if the unborn can be treated as a person, the right to life of the unborn can be equated with the fundamental right of the mother guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution."  The observation was made in a case where a pregnant woman, the gestation of whose pregnancy was about 31 weeks sought directions to the respondents to terminate her pregnancy. The scheme of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act was that a pregnancy cannot be terminated medically after 20 weeks, even if the circumstances mentioned in Section 3(2) exist. Advocate P.T Mohankumar appeared for the petitioner.  She contended that although substantial foetal abnormalities were diagnosed, the respondents were refusing to terminate the pregnancy, as the outer time limit prescribed for termination in terms of the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 was over.  Accordingly, during the proceedings, the Superintendent of Alappuzha Medical College was directed to convene a medical board, conduct a medical examination of the petitioner and submit a medical report.  The medical board thereafter submitted its report stating that termination of pregnancy may result in a live baby who may need prolonged hospitalisation because of prematurity and hence recommended continuation of the pregnancy. However, the petitioner argued that the foetal abnormalities could not be disputed in the light of the said report. Upon perusal of Section 3(2) of the MTP Act, it was revealed that a pregnancy could be medically terminated only if the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or grave injury to her physical or mental health or there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from serious physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. It was undisputed that an outer time limit was prescribed within which a pregnancy could be terminated medically.  However, the Court found that the constitutional courts in the country had been permitting termination of pregnancies medically if the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or grave injury to her physical or mental health or there is a substantial risk that the child if born, would suffer from serious physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. During the oral proceedings of the matter, the Court had also brought about a recent decision from the Bombay High Court where the medical termination of a 33 week old pregnancy was allowed by the Court.  The respondent, represented by Government Pleader Vinitha B. argued that in that case, the Medical report itself had recommended termination of pregnancy considering the complications involved in the pregnancy.  Following this, the Court said, "The trend of the decisions rendered by the courts in this regard would indicate the inadequacy of the provisions in the Act to protect the fundamental right to life of the pregnant woman to its fullest extent, especially having regard to the advancement of medical technology for safe abortion."  Similarly, it was observed that according to the Amendment Act of 2021, termination of pregnancy would be lawful even if it was carried out beyond 24 weeks if a Medical Board constituted in terms of the provisions of the Act diagnosed substantial foetal abnormalities. Therefore, the Bench found that the relief sought by the petitioner could not be granted at this stage since the Medical Board had not reported substantial foetal abnormalities in her pregnancy. The Court said decisions in such cases were made in an attempt to balance the rights of the mother as well as the foetus.  "In all cases where a court is called upon to adjudicate the question whether permission shall be granted to a pregnant woman for terminating her pregnancy on a plea of infringement of her fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21, the court is making a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn.  No doubt, while doing so, if there is any threat to the life of the mother, the scales shall certainly tilt in favour of the mother, for if the life of the mother cannot be saved, the life of the unborn cannot be protected." Therefore, it was found that when a duly constituted Medical Board opines that the stage of pregnancy is such that it may result in a live baby and that the foetal abnormalities diagnosed are not lethal, in the absence of any threat to the life or health of the mother, the reproductive choice of the mother which is a facet of the fundamental right guaranteed to her under Article 21 of the Constitution, will have to give way to the right of the unborn to be born. The petition was accordingly dismissed. Title: Indulekha Sreejith v Union of India and Ors   
The High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh has recently reiterated that holding departmental proceedings and recording finding of guilt against any delinquent and imposing punishment for the same, is quasi-judicial function and not administrative function.

The High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh has recently reiterated that holding departmental proceedings and recording finding of guilt against any delinquent and imposing punishment for the same, is quasi-judicial function and not administrative function.  Quashing an order issued by Secretary J&K State Board of School Education (BOSE) Srinagar against the petitioner, who was working as Senior Assistant in the Board, the court has observed that the penalty of withholding promotion of the petitioner from the date he becomes due for next promotion, is arbitrary and is not sustainable for the reason that no departmental enquiry was conducted into the alleged misconduct.  The bench headed by Justice M.A Chowdhary recorded that the penalty imposed on the petitioner in absence of being held guilty in regular enquiry is abuse of power by the respondents and this arbitrary action on the part of the respondents cannot be upheld.  The court noted that only preliminary enquiry had been conducted and the purpose behind holding preliminary enquiry is only to take prima facie view as to whether there can be some substance in the allegations made against an employee, which may warrant regular enquiry.  Placing reliance on Supreme Court directives in Amalendu Ghosh Vs. North Eastern Railway, the court recorded that a government servant cannot be punished on the findings of preliminary enquiry without holding a disciplinary enquiry after serving a charge sheet.  The Respondent J&K Board of School Education in its objections to the plea contended that the petitioner while posted at Branch Office allowed a candidate to fill the examination form of SSE (10th Class) Session-2008 Bi-Annual at late stage and entertained it notwithstanding the fact that the said candidate had already passed the SSE in the year 2003. The respondents further stated that they constituted a Fact Finding Committee to probe and fix the responsibility of the erring official. The Committee in its report held the said candidate guilty of unfair means and also held the petitioner responsible for the said irregularity.  Perusing the material on record, the court observed that it is crystal clear that no disciplinary committee was constituted by the respondents to conduct regular enquiry into the charges against the petitioner and the committee so constituted was only preliminary in nature and had been asked to pinpoint and probe into the irregularity committed by the officials of the Sub Office and to fix responsibility.  The court further noted that the respondents by acting upon the preliminary report without conducting the disciplinary enquiry to look into the charge against the petitioner have completely bypassed the Service Law Jurisprudence. The could reiterated that the settled position of law is that the official having committed misconduct during his service is to be charge-sheeted by framing articles of charge and to lead evidence before the enquiry officer as appointed, where the delinquent official must have a right to cross examine the witnesses and also lead evidence in his defense.  The court further observed that the evidence recorded in the preliminary enquiry cannot be used in regular departmental enquiry, as the delinquent is not associated with it and opportunity to cross examine the persons examined in such enquiry is not given. Using of such evidence has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case Nirmala J.Jhala Vs. State of Gujarat & Anr., (AIR 2013 SC 1513), as violative of the principles of natural justice, the court said.  The bench recorded that it was in this context incumbent upon the respondents to appoint an enquiry officer, serve charge sheet upon the petitioner as delinquent, lead evidence in support of the charge of misconduct and allow him to bring evidence in his defense.  "Respondents have thus committed grave irregularity by not conducting regular enquiry and imposing penalty of withholding next promotion of the petitioner for the period of two years from the date he becomes due for next promotion," the court said.  Allowing the plea, the bench recorded that the petitioner is stated to have superannuated and there is no question of conducting any enquiry against him at this stage and thus the order issued by the Board having been passed in arbitrary manner without conducting disciplinary enquiry into the alleged misconduct against the petitioner, is not sustainable and is accordingly quashed.

The Madras High Court recently expressed its concern over long pendency of cases involving large scale revenue. Justice S.M Subramaniam observed that cases of Income Tax, Customs, Excise, Mines and Minerals etc. must be disposed of quickly to prevent misuse of nation's property. Talking about the skewed tactics employed by stakeholders in keeping the writ petitions pending, so as to reap undue benefits of interim orders in force, the court added the following:  "The growing tendency on writ side is that such writ petitions involving large scale revenue, more specifically, Income Tax, Customs, Excise, Mines and Minerals etc., interim orders are in force for several years and the Nation's properties are being looted or misused or taken undue advantage of. Such a situation is absolutely unconstitutional and further anything under the earth belongs to the Government and it is the Nation's property, which belongs to 'We the People of India'. Thus, no one can be allowed to extract without adhering to the Act, Rules and Regulations and any violations are to be treated seriously and all these persons must be liable for all consequences."  The observation was made while adjudicating upon a plea for grant of transport permits for mining and transporting mined minerals to one of the factories of the Petitioner Company, Dalmia Refractories Limited. The court also remarked that a duty is cast upon the state to file counter-affidavits and vacate stay petitions immediately in such writ petitions involving State Revenue. The bench also opined that the High Court must be considerate about disposing of such writ petitions entertained immediately.  More than often, the filed writ petitions are not even listed for hearing before the court, which must be taken note of by the Registrar General of Madras High Court, the bench added.  "…There are several allegations that these writ petitions are not listed on account of bundles misplaced or on various other reasons, including corrupt activities and if these things are noticed, then serious actions are to be initiated against all officials, who all are responsible for lapses, negligence and dereliction of duty", the court underlined about the prevailing issue.   The court opined that the Grouping Section functioning in the High Court must collect large scale revenue cases pending for years. Thereafter, the Registry should place those cases before the Chief Justice for expeditious disposal.  "…Considering the fact that large scale State Revenues are in stake and many persons are taking undue advantage of the pendency of the writ petitions for unjust gains, which can never be tolerated and allowed by the Courts. Thus, the Registrar  General of the Madras High Court is directed to issue appropriate instructions to the Registry to collect all those writ petitions, where large scale State and Central Revenues are involved and list those matters, without causing any undue delay by obtaining necessary orders from the Hon'ble The Chief Justice, if necessary by constituting Special Benches for speedy disposal of those cases."  On the merits of the case, it was directed that the petitioner-Company is at liberty to submit all the required documents, including the Environmental Clearance Certificate and comply with the norms and requirements as contemplated under the law, enabling the Authorities to consider the case of the petitioner for grant of lease. Accordingly, the writ petition was disposed of. Advocate Rahul Balaji appeared for Petitioner Company, Advocate General R Shanmugasundaram assisted by Advocate K.M.D Muhilan appeared for Tamil Nadu Industries Department and Commissioner for Geology and Mining, whereas Senior Central Government Standing Counsel B. Rabu Manohar represented the Union Ministry of Mines.  Case Title: Dalmia Refractories Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.  Case No: WP No.36418 of 16 & WMP No.1031 of 2017   
The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, observed that the direction in Secretary, Ministry of Consumer Affairs v. Dr.Mahindra Bhaskar Limaye And Ors. that, the Central and State Governments are required to make certain amendments to the Consumer Protection Rules, 2020 pertaining to the appointment process at the Consumer Dispute fora is to be carried out on an urgent basis, preferably within 3 months’ time.   A Bench comprising Justice S.K. Kaul, Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice Aravind Kumar passed the directions in a public interest litigation challenging the inaction of the Governments in appointing President, Members and Staff of District and State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions across the country. It noted that the recent judgment in Secretary, Ministry of Consumer Affairs v. Dr.Mahindra Bhaskar Limaye And Ors. has an impact on the constitutional validity of certain rules concerning the appointment process, which might be relevant to the present case.   In Secretary, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Supreme Court had upheld the decision of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench)to quash the provisions of Consumer Protection Rules, 2020, framed by Central Government u/s 101 of Consumer Protection Act 2019, which prescribe a minimum professional experience of 20 years and 15 years for adjudicating members to the State consumer commissions and District forums respectively and which did away with the requirement of a written exam for appointment. The judgment held that persons having ten years of professional experience should be considered eligible for appointment as members of Consumer Commissions.It mandated that the future appointments to be done in compliance with the modified rules. In view of the same it directed the States and the Centre to modify their rules as per the order. The said judgment also had issued directions relating to selection process, by mandating a written exam.  In today's hearing, Senior Advocate, Gopal Sankaranarayanan (Amicus Curiae), informed the bench about this judgment.  “The Central Government and State Governments have been directed to amend rules for the appointment process and we expect the needful to be done on an urgent basis, preferably within 3 months’ time.”, the bench then noted. Mediation Cells  The Amicus Curiae, Gopal Sankaranarayanan apprised the Bench that 23 states have notified and set up Mediation Cells for which 1 month’s time was granted; 7 states have notified and set up but empanelment was not done. The Bench noted that it expected the remaining process to be completed at the earliest on an urgent basis. It further observed -   “Establishment of mediation cells is still under process in the UT of J&K, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman And Diu and Ladakh. We expect the States who have not complied yet to do so in 1 month from today.” The Counsel appearing for the NCT of Delhi informed the Bench that in Delhi there is a Dispute Resolution Society which takes care of the need of mediation in 11 centres. At present the issue of whether the DDRS can take care of consumer disputes as well is pending before the Delhi High Court in a writ petition. However, the Bench indicated that in the interim there should be a mediation mechanism for consumer disputes in NCT of Delhi.  Utilisation Certificate On the last date of hearing, the Court had marked three States (West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) which were responsible for 46% of the total un-utilised funds. On Tuesday, the Amicus informed the Bench that as on 06.03.2023, State of Uttar Pradesh has used INR 36.05 crore out of the un-utilised funds of INR 53.55 crore. The Senior Counsel appearing for the State of West Bengal and Rajasthan submitted that the respective States have also substantially utilised the un-utilised funds. However, since their affidavits were not on record, the Bench noted -  “State of Rajasthan submits that something was filed yesterday which shows decline in utilisation certificate. Insofar as the State of West Bengal is concerned it is submitted….10% balance remains from the original amount. The aforesaid may be looked into…” Presidents of State Commission Chairperson To be Designated as Head of the Department By way of the last order, the Bench noted that some of the Presidents had not been notified as Head of the Department and granted one month’s time to the concerned States to take necessary steps. On Tuesday, the Bench was informed that 13 States were in non-compliance of the said direction. Accordingly, the Bench granted another 4 weeks’ time to comply with the order, failing which the Secretaries of the respective States would be present before the Court on the next date of hearing.  Presidents of the State Commissions As Disciplinary Authority  On the last occasion, the Apex Court had directed that the States comply with the mandate of notifying the President of the State Commission as the disciplinary authority qua the staff of the Commission. That Amicus apprised the Bench that 19 States have appointed Presidents as the Disciplinary Authority. The Bench directed that the States that are yet to comply with the directions are granted 4 weeks’ time as last opportunity, failing which, the Secretaries of the respective States would be required to remain present before the Court on the next date of hearing.  Vacancy of Registrar at NCDRC  On the last date of hearing, the Bench had flagged the issue of absence of Registrar in NCDRC. Appearing before the Bench, on Tuesday, Additional Solicitor General, Balbir Singh informed it that the appointment rules had been issued in the month of March and the circular for vacant posts is to be issued shortly. He added that it is expected that the process would be completed within 3 months. It was pointed out by the Amicus that there are 4 prospective vacancies for members and one for Chairperson. The ASG assured the Bench that the process is on for the 5 posts (4 prospective and one existing vacancy) for members and one for the Chairperson.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that Section 125 Cr.P.C. is enacted for social justice and especially to protect women and children and also old and infirm parents and that this provision falls within the constitutional sweep of Article 15 (3), re-enforced by Article 39 of the Constitution of India.

The Allahabad High Court has observed that Section 125 Cr.P.C. is enacted for social justice and especially to protect women and children and also old and infirm parents and that this provision falls within the constitutional sweep of Article 15 (3), re-enforced by Article 39 of the Constitution of India.  The Bench of Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav observed thus as it stressed that this provision gives effect to the natural and fundamental duty of a man to maintain his wife, children, and parents so long as they are unable to maintain themselves. The bench observed thus as it dismissed a criminal revision plea moved by one Mukis challenging the order of November 2021 passed by Addl. Principal Judge, Family Court, Aligarh under Section 125 Cr.P.C. directing him to pay Rs. 3,000/- to his wife and Rs. 2000/- to her son as maintenance from the date of filing of the application seeking maintenance. Before the HC, the revisionist's counsel argued that the order to pay total maintenance to the tune of Rs. 5000/- per month from the date of application, could not be complied with by the revisionist on account of financial difficulties and therefore, he sought some time to deposit the said amount. Lastly, it was argued that his wife was residing away from her matrimonial house on her free will along with her parents without any rhyme and reason and that the court below had wrongly assessed the income of the revisionist while passing the impugned order.  Taking into account the facts and arguments made in the case, the Court noted that the wife is unable to maintain herself and that the revisionist had turned her wife on account of nonfulfillment of dowry demands.  The Court further observed that there is sufficient material on record to prove that the revisionist's wife does not have any independent earning, therefore, the Court concluded that it is incumbent upon the revisionist to provide financial succor to the respondent no. 2 (wife). Now, regarding the quantum of amount, the Court opined that the family court had provided a very meager amount to the wife and in case, the wife had been living with the revisionist, he would have had to spend at least this much amount on her.  Therefore, the Court held that it cannot be said that an exorbitant amount had been allowed by the concerned court.  However, in order to provide relief to the revisionist, the Court directed him to deposit the entire amount due against him in three equal monthly installments within three months and shall also pay regular monthly maintenance of Rs. 5000/-.  "In case the revisionist deposits the first installment by 15.4.2022 before the court below and further undertakes before the court below that he will pay the next installment by 10th of each succeeding months, no coercive measures shall be taken against him for a period of three months. It is further provided that in case of default in making payment of either the first installment or the successive installments the benefit of this order shall not be given to the revisionist and the court below will be at its liberty to take appropriate steps in accordance with law," the Court ordered as it dismissed the plea.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently transferred a suit from a Civil Court to the Commercial Court as the subject property in the suit was exclusively used for trade or commerce by a partnership firm, before its dissolution.  Brief facts of the case  The application was filed by the petitioner under Section 24 of Code of Civil Procedure to withdraw the suit from Senior Civil Judge's Court and transfer to Commercial Court for trial and disposal.  The case of the petitioner was that based on the dissolution deed of the partnership firm, she had filed the suit seeking partition and separate possession of suit schedule property consisting of movable and immovable assets. It was stated that the petitioner inadvertently and by mistake filed the suit before the Senior Civil Judge's Court whereas the dispute raised in the suit is commercial dispute.  In the counter affidavit, the respondent contended that the transfer petition was filed only to harass the respondents and delay the proceedings when it had almost reached the finality. Furthermore, the dispute in respect of immovable property cannot be transferred to a commercial court.  Ruling of the Court  The court observed that the dispute is a commercial dispute for specified value defined under Section 2(1)(c)(vii) [agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce] and 2(1)(c)(xv) [partnership agreements] of the Commercial Courts Act as the value of the suit is more than Rs. 3 lakhs and the property was exclusively used for trade and commerce in a partnership agreement.  The suit has been filed based on the dissolution of partnership deed. The subject property was used for business of the partnership firm wherein the petitioner was a partner. Hence, the Commercial Court will have jurisdiction to adjudicate schedule property exclusively used for trade or commerce.   The court thus allowed the petition finding it just and appropriate to transfer the suit.  Cause Title: GANGISETTY ANURADHA Versus BIJALA SUBRAMANYAM     
The Supreme Court observed that a writ petition challenging proceedings under SARFAESI Act initiated by private banks/Asset Reconstruction Companies is not maintainable."If proceedings are initiated under the SARFAESI Act and/or any proposed action is to be taken and the borrower is aggrieved by any of the actions of the private bank/bank/ARC, borrower has to avail the remedy under the... The Supreme Court observed that a writ petition challenging proceedings under SARFAESI Act initiated by private banks/Asset Reconstruction Companies is not maintainable. "If proceedings are initiated under the SARFAESI Act and/or any proposed action is to be taken and the borrower is aggrieved by any of the actions of the private bank/bank/ARC, borrower has to avail the remedy under the SARFAESI Act and no writ petition would lie and/or is maintainable and/or entertainable.", the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said. The court said that the activity of the bank/ARC (of lending the money to the borrowers) cannot be said to be as performing a public function which is normally expected to be performed by the State authorities. In this case, the High Court of Karnataka entertained the writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India filed by borrowers against an Assets Reconstructing Company and passed an interim order directing for maintaining status quo with regard to SARFAESI action (possession of the secured assets). Challenging this, the Assets Reconstructing Company (ARC) preferred appeals before the Apex Court. The ARCs contended that the writ petitions against the private party – ARC and that too against the communication proposing to take action under the SARFAESI Act would not be maintainable at all, and, therefore, the High Court ought not to have entertained such writ petitions and ought not to have granted the interim protection to the borrower. On the other hand, the borrowers contended that the ARC to act fairly while dealing with the security so as to secure the interest of the borrower as well as public at large (depositors). As the ARC has not performed the statutory duty cast upon it and there is a contravention of the statutory duty imposed under the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, a writ would lie against ARC against such an illegal action, it was contended.  Agreeing with the contention raised by the ARC, the Apex Court bench observed thus: 12....It is required to be noted that a writ petition against the private financial institution – ARC – appellant herein under Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the proposed action/actions under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act can be said to be not maintainable. In the present case, the ARC proposed to take action/actions under the SARFAESI Act to recover the borrowed amount as a secured creditor. The ARC as such cannot be said to be performing public functions which are normally expected to be performed by the State authorities. During the course of a commercial transaction and under the contract, the bank/ARC lent the money to the borrowers herein and therefore the said activity of the bank/ARC cannot be said to be as performing a public function which is normally expected to be performed 21 by the State authorities. If proceedings are initiated under the SARFAESI Act and/or any proposed action is to be taken and the borrower is aggrieved by any of the actions of the private bank/bank/ARC, borrower has to avail the remedy under the SARFAESI Act and no writ petition would lie and/or is maintainable and/or entertainable.  Addressing the contention of the borrowers that the Supreme Court ought not to interfere with the interim / interlocutory orders passed by the High Court, the bench said that the writ petitions by the borrowers before the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is an abuse of process of the Court. While allowing the appeals, the court observed thus: 13.2... The writ petitions have been filed against the proposed action to be taken under Section 13(4). As observed hereinabove, even assuming that the communication dated 13.08.2015 was a notice under Section 13(4), in that case also, in view of the statutory, efficacious remedy available by way of appeal under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petitions. Even the impugned orders passed by the High Court directing to maintain the status quo with respect to the possession of the secured properties on payment of Rs.1 crore only (in all Rs.3 crores) is absolutely unjustifiable. The dues are to the extent of approximately Rs.117 crores. The ad-interim relief has been continued since 2015 and the secured creditor is deprived of proceeding further with the action under the SARFAESI Act. Filing of the writ petition by the borrowers before the High Court is nothing but an abuse of process of Court. It appears that the High Court has initially granted an ex-parte ad-interim order mechanically and without assigning any reasons. The High Court ought to have appreciated that by passing such an interim order, the rights of the secured creditor to recover the amount due and payable have been seriously prejudiced. The secured creditor and/or its assignor have a right to recover the amount due and payable to it from the borrowers. The stay granted by the High Court would have serious adverse impact on the financial health of the secured 24 creditor/assignor. Therefore, the High Court should have been extremely careful and circumspect in exercising its discretion while granting stay in such matters. In these circumstances, the proceedings before the High Court deserve to be dismissed."

The Delhi High Court has directed the national capital government to take steps to ensure clean and hygienic milk is provided to the citizens and that cattle do not feed on plastic or garbage in the national capital  A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the cattle feeding on garbage or plastic can have a detrimental effect on the quality of milk and a deleterious effect on the people who consume it.  The court passed the direction while disposing of a public interest litigation moved by a lawyer Ritu Gauba. She had prayed that Commissioner of Delhi Police be directed to take all measures for ensuring clean and hygienic milk to be supplied to people residing in Delhi. While the Standing Counsel appearing for the police submitted that it is not the duty of the Commissioner of Police to ensure supply of clean and hygienic milk, the counsel appearing for Delhi government submitted that a representation be filed by the lawyer which would be considered by the government in accordance with law.  It was also submitted that adequate steps are being taken by the government to ensure supply of clean and hygienic milk to the citizens and that proper regulations are already in place to ensure the same. Taking note of the government’s stand, the court granted liberty to the petitioner lawyer to file a representation before the Delhi government.  Observing that no further orders are required to be passed in the matter, the bench said:  “The State Government (GNCTD) shall take appropriate steps to ensure that clean and hygienic milk is provided to the citizens of Delhi and that cattle do not feed on garbage, plastic, papers etc. as this can have a detrimental effect on the quality of milk which is produced by cows and the same can have deleterious effect on the people who consume it.” Title: RITU GAUBA ADVOCATE v.

The Rajasthan High Court on Monday directed the Central government to expeditiously decide on the claim application filed by a depositor of the beleaguered Adarsh Credit Co-operative Society Ltd. It ordered that the said decision has to be taken preferably within a period of 90 days, strictly in accordance with the law.  Justice Dinesh Mehta ordered, "The respondents are directed to take a decision on the application filed by the petitioner expeditiously, preferably within a period of ninety days from the date of receipt of copy of this order strictly in accordance with rules and guidelines governing the field."  The Adarsh Credit Co-op Society allegedly floated several fake companies and siphoned off its depositors money, approximately Rs. 8,000 Crore. In the present case, the grievance raised by the petitioner is that he had made certain deposits in the Co-operative Society under various schemes and heads, however, subsequently the establishment has been closed.  Advocate Surendra Bagmalani for the petitioner submitted that though a Liquidator was also appointed at the instance of Union of India and deposits of several creditors have been released, however, the deposits made by the petitioner have not been released.  In furtherance of this, a limited prayer was made before the court to direct the respondents to take a decision on the claim application of the petitioner seeking release of the amount lying deposited with Adarsh Credit Co-operative Society Ltd.

No one can either be taxed or penalised for holding an opinion which is not in conformity with the constitutional values, the Supreme Court remarked in its judgment delivered today. The Constitution Bench (majority 4:1) observed thus while holding that a mere statement made by a Minister, inconsistent with the fundamental rights of a citizen under Part ­III of the Constitution, may not constitute a violation of the constitutional rights and become actionable as Constitutional tort. One of the issues considered by the Constitution Bench in Kaushal Kishore vs State of Uttar Pradesh was “whether a statement by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part­III of the Constitution, constitutes a violation of such constitutional rights and is actionable as ‘Constitutional Tort’?" The court said that it has some difficulty with the words “a statement by a Minister”. It explained: "A statement may be made by a Minister either inside or outside the House of People/Legislative Assembly of the State. A statement may also be made by a Minister in writing or by words spoken. A statement may be made in private or in public. A statement may also be made by a Minister either touching upon the affairs of the Ministry/ department of which he is in control or touching generally upon the policies of the Government of which he is a part. A Minister may also make a statement, in the form of an opinion on matters about which he or his department is not concerned or over which he has no control. All such statements need not necessarily give rise to an action in tort or in constitutional tort." The bench cited an example of a case where a Minister makes a statement that women are unfit to be employed in a particular avocation. "It may reflect his insensitivity to gender equality and also may expose his low constitutional morality. The fact that due to his insensitivity or lack of understanding or low constitutional morality, he speaks a language that has the potential to demean the constitutional rights of women, cannot be a ground for action in Constitutional tort. Needless to say that no one can either be taxed or penalised for holding an opinion which is not in conformity with the constitutional values. It is only when his opinion gets translated into action and such action results in injury or harm or loss that an action in tort will lie."  The majority judgment therefore answered the issue raised as follows: "A mere statement made by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under PartIII of the Constitution, may not constitute a violation of the constitutional rights and become actionable as Constitutional tort. But if as a consequence of such a statement, any act of omission or commission is done by the officers resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, then the same may be actionable as a constitutional tort." A proper legal framework is necessary to define the acts or omissions which would amount to constitutional tort Justice BV Nagarathna, dissented with this view of the majority “A proper legal framework is necessary to define the acts or omissions which would amount to constitutional tort and the manner in which the same would be redressed or remedied on the basis of judicial precedent. Particularly, it is not prudent to treat all cases where a statement made by a public functionary resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, as a constitutional tort, except in the context of the answer given to Question No. 4 above.”  [Question No. 4 was answered as follows: “A statement made by a Minister if traceable to any affairs of the State or for protecting the Government, can be attributed vicariously to the Government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility, so long as such statement represents the view of the Government also. If such a statement is not consistent with the view of the Government, then it is attributable to the Minister personally.” ] Other reports about the judgment can be read here.

The Delhi High Court recently observed that once the employer has a right to terminate the probationer without issuing any notice and without granting any salary in lieu of notice, the same has to be made applicable to the probationer - when he wants to leave the job. The court made the observation in an judgement allowing an appeal of a probationer. In the decision, the court referred to the GAIL (General Terms and Conditions of Service Rules) that are applicable to the Gas Authority of India Limited employees. Differentiating between a regular employee and probationer, the division bench comprising of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the requirement of three months prior notice in case of resignation or equivalent pay would not apply to a probationer in this case. A single bench had earlier dismissed the plea filed by the probationer seeking a refund of three months' pay paid by him to GAIL in lieu of three months' notice while resigning. The plea was filed by one Paras Khuttan, who joined GIAL as Manager (Law) in 2019. He was appointed on probation for an initial period of one year and after successful completion, he was entitled to be confirmed. However, he resigned before completion of the probation.  GAIL directed him to serve three months' notice or three months' pay instead of the notice. It was Khuttan's case that since he remained in the probation period, the issue of giving prior notice or paying in lieu did not arise. He contended that the employers directed him to submit a total of Rs. 1,74,253 in lieu of the notice period. Khuttan paid the sum under protest and submitted a representation for a refund. However, his representations were rejected which resulted in moving the High Court. His plea was dismissed by the single judge. In appeal, Khuttan argued that the single judge kept the probationary and regular employees in one class erroneously and arrived at a conclusion that he was liable to pay three months' salary in lieu of three months' notice. Setting aside the impugned order, the Court said: "Once the employer is having a right to terminate the probationer without issuing any notice or without granting any salary in lieu of notice, the same has to be made applicable in case the probationer wants to leave the job and, therefore, to that extent, the learned Single Judge has erred in law and on facts in treating the probationer and regular employee at par in the matter of resignation." Advocate Anuj Agarwal appearing for Khuttan, relied on the case of Medha Moitra v. Union of India (2019), whereby the Calcutta High Court had accepted a plea arising out of similar circumstances. On the other hand, Advocate Purnima Maheshwari, counsel for GAIL, argued that being an employee, Khuttan either had to give three months' notice or equivalent pay in lieu as per statutory rules.  It was also argued that the said condition was mandatory and could not be waived off, as probationers were not placed in a different category. It was further contended that the definition of an employee includes probationers also in the matter of resignation. The court noted that Manager (LAW) is an E-3 Grade post and perused Khuttan's appointment letter which said the services during the period of termination can be terminated at any point of time without any notice. It said that GAIL (General Terms and Conditions of Service Rules) make it very clear that there is a distinction between the regular, temporary, daily rated, probationary, apprentice and employees on deputation.  "It is true that the Rules are applicable to all employees of the Company, however, employees and probationers are also defined under the Rules under the definition Clause," said the court. Referring to Rule 8.2, which was made basis for payment of three months salary in lieu of notice, the court said it provides that an employee of level E-O and above has to give three months notice of three months salary in lieu of notice. The court said by no stretch of imagine can Rule 8.2 be made applicable in case of a probationer in the matter of termination. Rule 8.2 starts with 'in case of employees', it noted. "The present case is an open and shut case of a probationer whose services could have been terminated at any point of time and the probationer was well within the right to resign at any point of time as he was not an employee and he was not covered under ... the Regulations governing the field," added the court. It said the petitioner is entitled for refund of the amount deposited by him in lieu of notice period and ordered same to be done within a period of three months. Case Title: Paras Khuttan v.

The Madras High Court has recently quashed a case against 5 persons who had allegedly indulged in a protest and had raised various slogans against Prime Minister for announcing Demonetization. The bench of Justice N. Sathish Kumar observed that the offences against the accused under Sections 143, 188 of IPC @ 143, 149, 353 IPC were not made out. Essentially, In November 2016, the members of the May-17 Organization along with its Leader and 100 participants indulged in the protest/agitation near Valluvar Kottam, Nungambakkam. Since they had allegedly raised slogans against the PM, they were booked under the aforementioned sections for unlawfully assembling and causing disturbance to the public. However, they moved the instant plea before the High Court arguing that the prosecution had been launched with false allegations and even if the entire prosecution case was taken at face value, the same would not constitute any offence and therefore, they submitted that the same may be quashed. Perusing the FIR, the Court observed that it was not the case of the prosecution that the petitioners along with other accused had unlawfully assembled and used force or violence and hence, the Court held that the offences under sections 143 of IPC is not attracted.  Further, the Court also noted that since it is not the case of the prosecution that the accused have used criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his official duty to attract the offence under section 353 of IPC, therefore, even this provision won't be applied. In view of this, the Court opined that the mere launching of FIR by the prosecution itself is not sufficient to reach the conclusion that offences are made out and the materials collected by the prosecution do not support the case and continuing the prosecution on shaky or without any materials is a clear abuse of process of law. Consequently, the Criminal Original Petition was allowed and proceedings against the petitioners on the file of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai were quashed.  Case title - Jegan @ Ellamaran and others v. State and another    
Punjab and Haryana High Court recently observed that a person said to be involved in betting and gambling under Section 13A Public Gambling Act, 1867 commits a non-cognizable offence and any investigation thereof requires prior permission from Magistrate under Section 155 CrPC. Thereby, it held that the raid conducted by the Police in the house of such person without Magistrate's permission is a procedural irregularity which goes to the root of the matter and is sufficient to quash the case.  The Bench of Justice Aman Chaudhary observed, "The reply of the State does not disclose that there was an order passed by the Magistrate to investigate the non-cognizable offence as required under Sub Section 2 of Section 155 Cr.P.C. The procedural infirmity in this case goes to the root of the matter, vitiating the proceedings thus initiated." The court was dealing with a case where the Police raided petitioner's house and recovered Rs.1,23,50,000/- along with laptop and mobile phone after receiving secret information about the petitioner's involvement in gambling.  Consequently, an FIR under Section 13-A of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 was registered and later, a charge-sheet was filed.  Petitioner's application for discharge was also dismissed by the trial Court on the ground that at the time of framing of the charges only prima facie case was to be seen.   The High Court noted that the investigation in a non-cognizable offence by the police without permission of the competent Magistrate is impermissible.  Court further noted that the police officer concerned was not authorised to enter by way of issuance of a warrant and search the house of the petitioner as per Section 5 of the Act. This procedural infirmity vitiates the proceedings thus initiated.  Adverting to the facts of the case in hand, indubitably it has not been brought out by the State that the police officer concerned was authorised to enter by way of issuance of a warrant and search the house of the petitioner, which is mandated as per Section 5 of the Act, a pre-requisite for which is that, upon receipt of credible information, the officer invested with power of Magistrate or District Superintendent of Police after conducting enquiry may either himself or by warrant authorise any other police officer to enter and search the place.  Furthermore, there is no specific reply by the State justifying the competence of the police officer.   The paras of the present petition particularly 5A to 5M wherein grounds have been raised to substantiate that the FIR was a clear abuse of process of law have not been specifically responded to except for stating "that the position has already been explained in the forgoing paragraphs", which have been reproduced hereinabove in this judgment, which also merely make a reference to the alleged recovery, investigation and confessional statement but nothing justifying either the competence of the officer or the registration of FIR in a non-cognizable offence or that the raid was conducted in pursuance of an order of the concerned Magistrate, passed after due enquiry on having received credible information.   As far as the classification between cognizable and non-cognizable offences as per Schedule 2 of Cr.P.C. is considered, the court noted that the same is that the lesser offence requires stronger scrutiny by the Magistrate.   According, the court concluded that the trial Court has committed grave error in proceeding to frame charges based on final report since the investigation could have been done only after complying with the provisions of law, as contemplated.  As sequel thereto, the present petition was allowed by the court. Case Title: SAURABH VERMA VERSUS STATE OF PUNJAB     
The Delhi High Court has said that a court cannot compel a lawyer to conclude cross examination on the very day it starts, except in rarest of circumstances.  "While it is open to a Court to jettison irrelevant and immaterial questions, if asked by Counsel, nonetheless, save and except in the rarest of circumstances, the Court cannot compel a Counsel to conclude cross-examination on the very day when it starts," Justice C Hari Shankar observed.  The observation was made by the court in its order dated October 27 on a plea challenging a civil judge's order closing the right of the defendant to cross examine a plaintiff witness in a suit. The Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner (defendant in the suit) apprised the court that after examination of the witness in question, the cross-examination was commenced at 3 PM and continued for three hours till 6:10 PM after which an adjournment was sought for further cross-examination which was declined by the civil judge. Discharging the witness and declining the request for adjournment, the civil judge in the order had said: "It is 06:10 PM already and ld. counsel for the defendant seeks adjournment on the ground that another counsel who has to cross examine the witness has not appeared today. It is pertinent to mention that the evidence had started at 12 : 15 PM and the cross examination of PW1 was deferred at 1 PM. Thereafter, the evidence was resumed at 3 PM, and the plaintiff witness has been examined at length. The Court is not unmindful of the fact that the plaintiff is an 80 yrs old citizen and despite the time constrain, several irrelevant questions have already been asked. Furthermore, perusal of the case file reveals that Sh.Vinay Pathak, ld. counsel for the defendant has been appearing in the present matter on all the dates and another counsel Sh.V.P. Rana has appeared only twice in the span of last 3 yrs." In appeal, Justice Shankar observed that since the cross-examination of the witness commenced only at 12.15 PM, the trial court, prima facie, was not justified in rejecting the petitioner's request seeking permission to continue cross-examination on the next date of hearing. "That apart, the factors which have made with the learned Civil Judge in refusing the petitioner's request for further opportunity to cross-examine PW-1, as reflected in the impugned order dated 14th September 2022, cannot be treated as relevant. All that the learned Civil Judge observes is that the plaintiff was 80 years of age and several irrelevant questions had been put to her," said Justice Shankar. Allowing the petition, the court said petitioner ought to be allowed to continue cross-examination of the witness on the next date of hearing when the matter is listed before the civil judge. "The petitioner is directed to endeavour and make all efforts to conclude the cross- examination of PW-1 on the said date. No adjournment would be granted to the petitioner in that regard," the court ordered while disposing of the plea.  Title: SUNITA v. PREMWATI    
The Allahabad High Court has granted bail to the slain gangster Vikas Dubey's brother Deepak Dubey in connection with a cheating case.

The Allahabad High Court has granted bail to the slain gangster Vikas Dubey's brother Deepak Dubey in connection with a cheating case. The allegation against Dubey is that he was found using a sim card registered in someone else's name with the intention to commit crime. However, keeping in view the nature of the offence, the argument advanced on behalf of the parties, evidence on record regarding the complicity of the accused, and the larger mandate of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the bench of Justice Siddharth granted him bail. Before the Court, Dubey's counsel argued that he has been falsely implicated in this case since he is the brother of the criminal Late Vikas Dubey and his brother was arrested in July 2021, he had been falsely implicated by the police in four cases after a gap of 16 years.  It was contended that there is no allegation against him that he used his mobile phone number in the commission of any crime nor any complaint was lodged by the real owner of the mobile phone, Daya Shankar Agnihotri against him.  Lastly, it was argued that the offence is triable by the Magistrate, the applicant is in jail since January 2021, and that there is no possibility of an early conclusion of the trial. On the other hand, the  A.G.A. appearing on behalf of the State opposed the bail application by submitting that the mobile number in question belong to the servant of late Vikas Dubey and the same was being misused by the applicant in aiding the escape of Vikas Dubey. It was also argued that the First Information Report was lodged on the basis of a detailed report submitted by the Special Investigating Team based on the statement of Daya Shankar Agnihotri and since the rules of the Telecom Regulatory Authority do not permit the change of subscriber, therefore, the applicant is not entitled to be enlarged on bail.

The Karnataka High Court has dismissed a petition filed by a husband seeking to quash a case of dowry death registered against him under Sections 304B and 498A of IPC, after his wife, living separately since over two years, committed suicide in her parental house.

The Karnataka High Court has dismissed a petition filed by a husband seeking to quash a case of dowry death registered against him under Sections 304B and 498A of IPC, after his wife, living separately since over two years, committed suicide in her parental house.  A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna while dismissing the petition filed by one Niranjan Hegde said that the existence of seriously disputed questions of fact in the case require a "full blown trial" and hence, there is no ground to quash the proceedings at this stage. It observed, "The contention is that it should be 'soon before death' and soon before death is required to be interpreted as 'immediately before death' and the deceased leaving matrimonial house two years ago would not mean immediately before death, are all repellable, as it is too farfetched to be considered at this juncture."  The bench also noted that, "The case at hand is also one such, where the complainant has placed on record such material that would demand further proceedings to be continued against the petitioner and the petitioner has not placed on record any document that is so unimpeachable and of sterling quality which would entail quashing of entire proceedings at the stage of registration of FIR itself."  As per the complaint filed by the father of the deceased the couple got married in the year 2017, the relationship between the wife and the husband did not go well immediately after marriage and they had serious compatibility issues between them. When incompatibility became inevitable, the daughter of the complainant appears to have left the matrimonial home and began to reside with her parents at Bangalore. All efforts of reconciliation which were on for over two years are said to have failed.  On the score of irreconcilable incompatibility both the petitioner and the daughter of the complainant filed an application for divorce under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, by mutual consent, accompanied by an application for waiver of 6 months cooling off period.  During the pendency of the said petition before the Family Court, it transpires, the Petitioner's wife committed suicide by hanging herself in the bed room of her parental house and a report of suicide was made before the jurisdictional police. On the said incident, a complaint came to be registered against the Petitioner-husband under Sections 304B, 313 and 498A of the IPC.  Advocate Arun Govindaraj, appearing for the petitioner contended that a strained relationship between the husband and the wife for over two years has led the daughter of the complainant to leave the matrimonial house and reside in her parents' house. The family of the complainant also has a problem amongst themselves.  The complainant argued that the investigation is still on. At this stage, what is to be looked into is only whether prima facie the complaint satisfies the ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC. Further, there are other offences alleged under Sections 313 and 498A of the IPC which are all cognizable.  Findings:  The bench went through the complaint and relied on judgments of the Supreme Court and said, "The complaint narrates that on the night of 12-06-2022 just before the fateful incident she was in conversation with her husband. Whether the conversation with the husband before her death has led to commission of suicide or it was collective harassment for years that has exploded in the said commission of suicide is a matter to be necessarily tried, as prima facie the complaint narrates such instances which could become ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC."  Then it said, "The FIR is registered for offences punishable under Section 304B of the IPC along with other offences. The complaint and the narration prima-facie indicate ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC."  Further the bench took into account the transfer of amount made by the father-in-law to the accused in his bank accounts and said, "There are documents placed now to indicate the funds being transferred from the father-in-law to the son-in-law. Therefore, prima facie, ingredients of all offences are met for registration of the crime and conduct of investigation."  It then held, "The matter with such serious offence as could be gathered from available documents on record cannot be interjected at this juncture, as there are undoubtedly a plethora of seriously disputed questions of fact. The primary ingredient of death happening before 7 years of marriage exists in the case at hand, as the couple got married in the year 2017 and the daughter of the complainant commits suicide on 12-06-2022. What has driven the daughter to commit suicide either cruelty or demand of dowry, is to be thrashed out in a full blown trial."  Accordingly it dismissed the petition.  Case title: NIRANJAN HEGDE v.

The Karnataka High Court has quashed the order passed by the Endowment Commissioner, dismissing an Archak of the Bhoga Nandishwara Temple in Chikkaballapur Taluk, without holding an inquiry on charges of alleged misconduct.  A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna directed the respondent-authority to afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and complete the enquiry within two weeks, as was directed by the High Court in an earlier round of litigation (against petitioner's suspension). Till then, it permitted the petitioner to perform as Archak in the temple.  The petitioner was appointed as Archak in 2015. In 2020, anonymous complaints emerged against him alleging certain irregularities in the performance of his duties. The proceedings were initiated on the basis of an anonymous letter and a photograph depicting the petitioner holding bottles of liquor. A show cause notice was issued to the petitioner, to which he responded and subsequently, came to be placed under suspension.  Since no enquiry was conducted for over a year, the petitioner had then approached the High Court seeking quashment of the order of suspension. It is in these proceedings that the High Court directed the respondent to accomplish the enquiry in question within a period of two weeks failing which, the suspension of the petitioner shall be treated as having been rescinded and he will be permitted to discharge duties  The High Court had relied on Section 10(A) of the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act 1997 Act, which pertains to Disqualification of Archaks.  Findings:  In the instant proceedings, the High Court noted that no enquiry was conducted pursuant to its order. "What comes about is an order dismissing the petitioner from the duties of Archak without holding any enquiry as was directed by this Court. Therefore, the order not only runs counter to the order passed by this Court on 22.8.2022, but is in blatant violation of the principles of natural justice and denial of opportunity to defend himself," Court said.  It added, "On these reasons, the order of dismissal is rendered unsustainable and requires to be obliterated. Obliteration of the order will result in a direction of permitting the petitioner to perform his duties subject to the outcome of the enquiry. This direction is issued in the peculiar facts of the case, for the reason that the respondents seek to overreach the earlier order by passing an order of dismissal."   Case Title: ASHVEEJA T.C v.

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to a POCSO Accused taking into account the welfare of the child born out of wedlock of Accused and Victim. The Court stressed that the life of a newborn child is at stake and she can't be left to face the stigma during her life. In the instant case, the accused and the victim (both from the same village) had a love affair and out of fear of the villagers, the accused has eloped with the victim in May 2018 and had undergone marriage in a temple although the said marriage was not registered. However, as per the prosecution case, the accused had left her alone outside the village in December 2018 i.e. after a period of about six months. The victim was found pregnant at that time she gave a birth to a female child in December 2018. Before the Court, the Accused submitted that he is the father of the child and he is very much willing to keep his married wife (Wife) and the newborn baby with him. In view of this, noting that in such matters, the Court has to take a practical approach, the Bench of Justice Krishan Pahal opined thus: "Both the accused and the victim are of very young age and have barely attained the age of majority. A baby girl has been born out of their wedlock. Though, the marriage may not be described as per the law of the land, but the Court has to apply a pragmatic approach in such conditions and indeed both the families are required to act practically" Taking noted of the facts of the instant case, the court opined that in a conservative and non-permissive society, it is true that marriage in the same village is prohibited and is not customary, and it may be an after effect of media and cinema.  "Instances of marriage in the same village are on the rise. This does adversely affect the social fabric," the Court added. Underscoring that in the case, the life if the child is at stake, the Court further added thus: "Youth in their tender age become victim to the legal parameters though rightly framed by the legislature, but here this Court is being drawn to make an exception in the extraordinary circumstances of the case...The mathematical permutations and combinations have to be done away with. A hypertechnical and mechanical approach shall do no good to the parties and why should an innocent baby out of no fault of her bear the brutalities of the society in the present circumstances. Human psychosis and that too of the adolescents has to be taken into account." In view of this, the Court directed that the bail applicant-Ramshankar be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to the Condition that he shall deposit (fixed deposit) a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- in the name of new born child of the victim till her attaining the age of majority within a period of six months from the date of release from jail.

The Allahabad High Court has recently observed that receiving proper education is a Fundamental Right enshrined under Article 21-A of the Constitution of India. The Bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi further observed that educational authorities must ensure that the grievance relating to the admission to an institution is redressed with promptness and does not remain unattended. The case in brief Essentially, the bench was dealing with the case of one Tanishk Srivastava, an 8th-class student. He appeared in the entrance test held on March 20, 2022, for admission as Resident Scholar in the La Martiniere College, Lucknow for taking admission in Class VIII. On March 25, 2022, the results were declared and Tanishk was declared successful and eligible for admission in Class-VIII as Resident Scholar. However, due to his mother's serious illness and his father being out of the station, he could not get admitted as Resident Scholar. Therefore, his father moved an application on April 4, 2022, before the school management and prayed that instead of treating his son as a Resident Scholar, he may be given admission as Day Scholar as he is ready to complete all required formalities including the fees. When the appellant/writ petitioner, the father of the candidate was not informed about the fate of the admission of his son till April 18, 2022, he filed a writ petition before the Court. The same was dismissed by a single judge. Challenging the same, he moved the instant appeal before the division bench. Court's observations The court upheld the order of the single judge who had dismissed the writ plea on the ground that since the institution was an unaided minority private institution, therefore, the writ petition against it may not be entertained. The Court, in this regard, relied upon the July 2016 order passed by the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.7030 of 2016, Committee of Management, La Martiniere College, Lucknow, and Anr Vs. Vatsal Gupta and Others. However, before dismissing the appeal, the Court did observe that the institution should have forwarded the specific information (whether he could be admitted to the school as a resident scholar) to the parents of such student at the earliest so that appropriate steps could be taken by the parents of such student. "This is not a case where the student has not qualified the entrance examination for getting admission in particular class i.e. Class-VIII but this is a case where such student has qualified such entrance examination as Resident Scholar but due to compelling and unavoidable circumstances he could not be able to get admission as Resident Scholar. Therefore, in such compelling circumstances, at least on the basis of principles of equity, it was bare minimum required on the part of the Principal of the institution to apprise the parents of the student that the institution would be unable to provide admission to their ward in Class-VIII as a Day Scholar student," the Court further added. The bench also opined that so if the request of the student/parents of the student was not liable to be accepted by the school, this decision should have been immediately conveyed to the parents so that, the Court added, the student could get admission in any other institution for receiving proper education inasmuch as to receive proper education is a Fundamental Right enshrined under Article 21-A of the Constitution of India. Further, stressing that whatever is possible under the law or under the principles of equities, a prompt decision should be taken and intimated to all aggrieved so that the consequential steps could be taken well in time, the Court directed that the copy of the order be provided to the following opposite parties:  - Principal Secretary, Primary Education, Civil Secretariat, Bapu Bhawan, Lucknow.  - District Magistrate, Lucknow.  - Director, Indian School Certificate Examination Board, Pragati House, 3rd Floor 47-48, Nehru Place, New Delhi.  - Principal, La Martiniere College, Martin Purva Road, Lucknow-226001.

The Kerala High Court recently observed the wife not being able to lead a peaceful life in matrimonial home, in view of the particular circumstances there, may not always be 'cruelty' but could be a reasonable ground to deny 'joint residence' and same does not grant the husband any discretion to deny payment of maintenance.  Justice A. Badharudeen, while dealing with an argument that wife may not be legally entitled to get maintenance from husband after leaving matrimonial home voluntarily, said: ... when a party seeks divorce on the ground of cruelty, there shall be sufficient pleadings alleging cruelty, and evidence to prove the cruelty, to succeed in the divorce petition. But difference of opinion otherwise, in view of the particular circumstances at the matrimonial home, whereby the wife could not lead a peaceful life time, shall not, always be 'cruelty', but these are also reasonable grounds to deny joint residence. In such cases, it could not be held that there was willful discretion to deny payment of maintenance. The Family Court had earlier directed a man - the revision petitioner, to pay Rs 4,000 maintenance to his wife who had claimed the same under Section 125(1) CrPC. In revision before the high court, the husband argued that since she had left his company voluntarily and without any justified reasons, he had no liability to pay maintenance to his wife.  The counsel appearing for the husband contended that the wife is not legally entitled to get maintenance since she has been willingly residing separately and that the case filed by the respondent on the ground of cruelty ended in acquittal. The court said the evidence suggests that wife left the matrimonial home since she could not reside there due to the particular circumstances prevailing over there. "In view of the above, there is no reason to hold that the respondent is not entitled to get maintenance. Therefore, the entitlement of maintenance found by the Family Court can only be confirmed," said the court. However, considering the fact that the woman remarried in September 2022, the court observed that the entitlement of maintenance ceased from the date of remarriage.  "However, the revision petitioner is bound to clear the maintenance till this date," it added. The court reduced the maintenance amount to Rs 3,500 after observing that actual income of the husband was not fully established.  "Therefore, the revision petitioner is directed to clear the entire arrears at the rate of Rs.3,500/- per month, starting from the date of petition till the date of remarriage, within a period of thirty days and on failure to do so, the respondents are at liberty to execute the modified order, in accordance with law," it ordered. Advocate M R Sarin appeared for the Revision Petitioner. Advocate Badra Kumari K V appeared for the Respondent.  Case Title: Arun v. Reshma

While deliberating upon the 'larger question' regarding 'installation of towers on residential building', the Punjab & Haryana High Court on Wednesday (03rd March) directed the Punjab Government to not allow installation of towers on the residential buildings till further orders (as an interim measure). The Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh has passed this order in view of the fact that installation of towers in a haphazard manner may endanger lives and property of the people and would violate their rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. Apart from this, the Bench has also issued a notice of motion to the Punjab State Government asking them to clarify as to whether a uniform policy was being adopted across the Punjab or stand-alone instructions had been given for a particular place (SAS Nagar). Another question which arose before the Court is- as to whether due to wind velocity at times, there can be a danger of the tower being dislocated and endanger the lives of the people? As a preliminary observation, the Court noted that apart from the tower, there are batteries on the roof which may not be able to bear the burden. The matter has been posted for further hearing on 10th March 2021. Recently, while refusing to issue a mandamus to the respondents for shifting the Mobile Tower to another place, the Uttarakhand High Court had said that it is neither the responsibility nor the duty of the Court to run the administration  Also, the Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ petition seeking removal of a mobile tower from a residential area on the ground that it has deleterious effects on human health. Relying on the decision of a Division Bench in Asha Mishra v. State of UP & Ors. ;2017 (1) UPLBEC 261, the Court held,  "Such matters must be left to the mature wisdom of the Government or the implementing agency. It is their forte. In such cases, if the situation demands, the courts should take only a detached decision based on the pattern of the well settled principles of administrative law."

The... The Supreme Court reiterated that reinstatement with full back wages is not automatic in every case, where termination / dismissal is found to be not in accordance with procedure prescribed under law. In this case, an employee appointed as Clerk-cum-Cashier was dismissed from service by the Allahabad Bank alleging his involvement in the incident relating to burning of bank records. The Industrial Tribunal found that though there was a strong suspicion, but there was no sufficient evidence to prove his misconduct to dismiss from service. The Tribunal found that the Bank has lost confidence on the respondent and ordered payment of monetary compensation of Rs.30,000/- in lieu of reinstatement. The High Court, while disposing an appeal against this award passed by the Tribunal, directed the employer to reinstate the workman with all consequential benefits. During the pendency of appeal before the Apex Court, the employee attained age of superannuation. "The reinstatement with full back wages is not automatic in every case, where termination / dismissal is found to be not in accordance with procedure prescribed under law. Considering that the respondent was in effective service of the Bank only for about six years and he is out of service since 1991, and in the meantime, respondent had attained age of superannuation, we deem it appropriate that ends of justice would be met by awarding lump sum monetary compensation. ", the bench of Justices R. Subhash Reddy and Sanjiv Khanna observed. Thus, the bench directed payment of lump sum compensation of Rs.15 lakhs to him within a period of eight weeks. In a judgment delivered in another case [Ram Manohar Lohia Joint Hospital vs. Munna Prasad Saini], the court set aside the direction for reinstatement and enhanced the compensation by awarding a lump sum amount. In the said case, the bench referred to following observations in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v. Bhurumal (2014) 7 SCC 177: The ordinary principle of grant of reinstatement with full back wages, when the termination is found to be illegal is not applied mechanically in all cases. While that may be a position where services of a regular/permanent workman are terminated illegally and/or mala fide and/or by way of victimisation, unfair labour practice, etc. However, when it comes to the case of termination of a daily-wage worker and where the termination is found illegal because of a procedural defect, namely, in violation of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, this Court is consistent in taking the view that in such cases reinstatement with back wages is not automatic and instead the workman should be given monetary compensation which will meet the ends of justice. Rationale for shifting in this direction is obvious.The reasons for denying the relief of reinstatement in such cases are obvious. It is trite law that when the termination is found to be illegal because of non-payment of retrenchment compensation and notice pay as mandatorily required under Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, even after reinstatement, it is always open to the management to terminate the services of that employee by paying him the retrenchment compensation. Since such a workman was working on daily-wage basis and even after he is reinstated, he has no right to seek regularisation [see State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3)]. Thus when he cannot claim regularisation and he has no right to continue even as a daily-wage worker, no useful purpose is going to be served in reinstating such a workman and he can be given monetary compensation by the Court itself inasmuch as if he is terminated again after reinstatement, he would receive monetary compensation only in the form of retrenchment compensation and notice pay. In such a situation, giving the relief of reinstatement, that too after a long gap, would not serve any purpose.We would, however, like to add a caveat here. There may be cases where termination of a daily-wage worker is found to be illegal on the ground that it was resorted to as unfair labour practice or in violation of the principle of lastcome-first-go viz. while retrenching such a worker daily wage juniors to him were retained. There may also be a situation that persons junior to him were regularised under some policy but the workman concerned terminated. In such circumstances, the terminated worker should not be denied reinstatement unless there are some other weighty reasons for adopting the course of grant of compensation instead of reinstatement. In such cases, reinstatement should be the rule and only in exceptional cases for the reasons stated to be in writing, such a relief can be denied.

The Supreme Court observed that a tenant ­in ­sufferance is not entitled to any protection of the Rent Act against SARFAESI proceedings. A tenant whose term has expired but has not vacated is called a "tenant at sufferance.‟. In the absence of a registered instrument, if the tenant only relies upon an unregistered instrument or an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession, the tenant is not entitled to possession of the secured asset for more than the period prescribed under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, the bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari observed. In this case, the appellant contended that he is a protected tenant under the provisions of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act 1999, and was residing in the premises of the borrower on the basis of an oral tenancy from 12.06.2012. The proceedings under Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, were initiated against the borrowers. The intervention application of the appellant was dismissed by the Magistrate holding that there was no registered tenancy placed on record by him In appeal, the court noted that in Harshad Govardhan Sondagar v. International Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd. , it was held that if the tenancy claim is for any term exceeding one year, the tenancy can be made only by a registered instrument. Referring to Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal v. Central Bank of India, the bench observed:  "12. A Three ­Judge Bench of this Court in Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal v. Central Bank of India & Anr, after considering almost all decisions of this Court, in relation to the right of a tenant in possession of the secured asset, has held that if a valid tenancy under law is in existence even prior to the creation of the mortgage, such tenant's possession cannot be disturbed by the secured creditor by taking possession of the property. If a tenancy under law comes into existence after the creation of a mortgage but prior to issuance of a notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, it has to satisfy the conditions of Section 65­A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. If a tenant claims that he is entitled to possession of a Secured Asset for a term of more than a year, it has to be supported by the execution of a registered instrument. In the said decision of this Court, it was clarified that in the absence of a registered instrument, if the tenant only relies upon an unregistered instrument or an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession, the tenant is not entitled to possession of the secured asset for more than the period prescribed under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act." The court noted that it was also held that the Rent Act would not come to the aid of a "tenant­ in ­sufferance" vis­à­vis SARFAESI Act due to the operation of Section 13(2) read with Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act. In this case, the court observed that there is a serious doubt as to the bona fide of the tenant, as there is no good or sufficient evidence to establish the tenancy. "The appellant has pleaded tenancy from 12.06.2012 to 17.12.2018. This is not supported by any registered instrument. Further, even according to the appellant, he is a "tenant­ in­ sufferance", therefore, he is not entitled to any protection of the Rent Act. Secondly, even if the tenancy has been claimed to be renewed in terms of Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act, the Borrower would be required to seek consent of the secured creditor for transfer of the Secured Asset by way of sale, lease or otherwise, after issuance of the notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act and, admittedly, no such consent has been sought by the Borrower in the present case", the court said while dismissing the appeal.       
The Supreme Court of India on Monday sought the stand of the Centre and the National Medical Commission on a plea against a circular retrospectively requiring foreign medical graduates without clinical training to undergo a Compulsory Rotatory Medical Internship (CRMI) for two years instead of one. A division bench comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Vikram Nath, directed this matter to be heard along with a batch of petitions filed by foreign graduates from China, Ukraine, Philippines, who were unable to complete clinical training because of intervening circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine war, and consequently, wanted to be accommodated within the Indian medical education architecture. The batch of petitions will be heard on Wednesday, January 25.  The bench headed by Justice Gavai was informed by Advocate Shivam Singh that the scheme framed by the National Medical Commission, pursuant to an April 2022 ruling, allowing foreign graduates who were unable to complete clinical training to secure provisional registration in India after completing an internship of two years, was made to retrospectively cover even such foreign medical students who had already received their provisional or permanent registration certificates. The effect of this circular was that the registration of such doctors, despite them having treated patients for several months, stood cancelled and the certificates already issued by state medical councils were revoked.  Urging the court to hold in abeyance, the disqualification notice vis-à-vis the petitioners who had already obtained permanent registration certificates, Singh argued, “The petitioners are not shying away from an opportunity to gain more experience. But they are in a situation where the court has directed the centre and the commission to devise a workable solution for the junior batch that has completed three semesters online, whereas the petitioners have had only one remote semester. That too, at a time when the pandemic was waging – between January and May 2020. After that, the petitioners have also qualified the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination and secured their provisional medical registration.”  The bench expressed its disinclination to grant any interim relief immediately and asked the petitioners to wait till the next hearing. Justice Gavai said, “The petitioners can wait for nine days. If we deem fit, we will set aside the disqualification then.” On behalf of the bench, he pronounced, “Issue notice returnable on January 25. The petitioners have also been granted the liberty to serve the standing counsel for the first respondent and the central agency for the other respondent.”  The petitioners have contended that the notice issued on July 28, 2022, was, inter alia, contrary to the principles of equity and fair play, and the doctrine of legitimate expectations, besides being violative of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21. The retrospectivity of the circular has also been called in question. The petition was filed through Advocate-on-Record, Gopal Singh. Advocates Shivam Singh and Shaswati Parhi appeared for the petitioners.  Singh told LiveLaw, “The petition challenges the National Medical Commission’s powers to retrospectively impose conditions and even deregister doctors. In case the impugned circular is allowed to operate, then it introduces uncertainty in the lives of doctors who have already studied for several years. Additionally, it is a classic case of changing the rules of the game after the game has started.”  In April of last year, a division bench headed by Justice Hemant Gupta had directed the National Medical Commission to frame a scheme to allow students of the batch 2015-20 who were unable to undergo their clinical training to complete it in medical colleges identified by the commission, while hearing an appeal against a Madras High Court direction to allow such a student to be provisionally registered. In December, while hearing similar petitions by foreign medical graduates of the batch 2016-21, the top court left it to the centre and the National Medical Commission to find a solution, but urged them to look at the problem from a humanitarian angle.  Case  Gurmukh Singh & Ors. v. National Medical Commission & Ors. | Writ Petition (Civil) No. 25/2023 
The Supreme Court has observed that an offender who had not used any deadly weapon at the time of committing robbery/dacoity cannot be convicted under Section 397 of the Indian Penal Code.The use of deadly weapon by one offender at the time of committing robbery/dacoity cannot attract Section 397 IPC for the imposition of minimum punishment on another offender who has not used any... The Supreme Court has observed that an offender who had not used any deadly weapon at the time of committing robbery/dacoity cannot be convicted under Section 397 of the Indian Penal Code. The use of deadly weapon by one offender at the time of committing robbery/dacoity cannot attract Section 397 IPC for the imposition of minimum punishment on another offender who has not used any deadly weapon, In this case, the appellants -accused were convicted under Section 397 IPC which reads thus: If, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years. Before the Apex Court, it was contended that the allegation of use of any weapon was against the other accused only and thus in absence of any allegations of use of any deadly weapon by the appellants, Section 397 IPC is not attracted. To address this argument, the court first noticed Sections 391-398 and summarized the law regarding robbery and dacoity as follows: As per Section 390 IPC, for 'robbery' there is either theft or extortion. When in the committing of the theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint the theft can be said to be 'robbery'. In similar situation the 'extortion' can be said to have committed 'robbery'. As per explanation to Section 390 IPC the offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.Section 391 IPC defines 'dacoity'. When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, the accused then can be said to have committed the 'dacoity'. As per Section 392 IPC whoever commits robbery shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine. However, if the robbery is committed on the highway between sunset and sunrise, the imprisonment may be extended to fourteen years. As per Section 393 IPC even an attempt to commit robbery is punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years with fine. As per Section 394 IPC if any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other person jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine. Section 395 IPC provides for punishment for 'dacoity'. Whoever commits dacoity shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine In case of dacoity with murder (Section 396 IPC) if any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years with fine. As per Section 397 IPC if at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years. Similarly, if, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity the offender is armed with any deadly weapon, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years 'Dacoity' an exaggerated version of robbery Taking note of this , the bench observed that the 'dacoity' can be said to be an exaggerated version of robbery On conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, commission of 'robbery' is sine qua non. The 'dacoity' can be said to be an exaggerated version of robbery. If five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit robbery it can be said to be committing the 'dacoity'. Therefore, the only difference between the 'robbery' and the 'dacoity' would be the number of persons involved in conjointly committing or attempt to commit a 'robbery'. The punishment for 'dacoity' and 'robbery' would be the same except that in the case of 'dacoity' the punishment can be with imprisonment for life. However, in the case of 'dacoity with murder' the punishment can be with death also. However, in a case where the offender uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years. The court thus agreed with the contention that to bring the case within Section 397 IPC, the offender who uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person shall be liable for minimum punishment under Section 397 IPC. Section 392 and Section 390 IPC are couched in different words. In Sections 390, 394, 397 and 398 IPC the word used is 'offender'. Therefore, for the purpose of Sections 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398 IPC only the offender/person who committed robbery and/or voluntarily causes hurt or attempt to commit such robbery and who uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person, or commits to cause death or grievous death any person  at the time of committing robbery or dacoity can be punished for the offences under Sections 390, 392, 393, 394, 395 and 397 and 398 IPC. For the aforesaid, the accused cannot be convicted on the basis of constructive liability and only the 'offender' who 'uses any deadly weapon….' can be punished. However, so far as Section 391 IPC 'dacoity' and Section 396 IPC – 'dacoity with murder' is concerned an accused can be convicted on the basis of constructive liability, however the only requirement would be the involvement of five or more persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery – dacoity/dacoity with murder (Para 12.4) In the instant case, the court noted that there is no allegation against the appellant accused that they used dangerous weapons. The court referred to  Phool Kumar vs. Delhi Administration, (1975) 1 SCC 797 (para 5 & 6) and Dilawar Singh vs. State of Delhi, (2007) 12 SCC 641 (para 19 to 22) and observed: Thus, as per the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid two decisions the term 'offender' under Section 397 IPC is confined to the 'offender' who uses any deadly weapon and use of deadly weapon by one offender at the time of committing robbery cannot attract Section 397 IPC for the imposition of minimum punishment on another offender who has not used any deadly weapon. Even there is distinction and difference between Section 397 and Section 398 IPC. The word used in Section 397 IPC is 'uses' any deadly weapon and the word used in Section 398 IPC is 'offender is armed with any deadly weapon'. Therefore, for the purpose of attracting Section 397 IPC the 'offender' who 'uses' any deadly weapon Section 397 IPC shall be attracted. (Para 12.7) The other issue in this case was whether if the accused could not have been convicted for the offence under Section 397 IPC, still their conviction and sentence can be sustained under Section 391 IPC or not. The court noticed that in this case all the accused were charged by the trial Court for the offences under Section 395 IPC as well as 397 IPC. Therefore, once a case under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC is made out, they can be convicted for the offence under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC as no prejudice shall be caused to the accused, the court held. Regarding this, the court observed: "Even otherwise there is no difference between Section 391/395 and Section 397 IPC so far as sentence/punishment except the difference in case of Section 397 IPC the punishment shall not be less than seven years. Otherwise, the 'robbery' and 'dacoity' are sine qua non. 'Dacoity' is nothing but an exaggerated version of 'robbery' with a difference in number of accused. Therefore, also even in a case where the accused is not convicted for the offence under Section 397 IPC, still he can be punished under Section 395 IPC and no prejudice shall be caused to him as ultimately the prosecution has to prove the 'robbery' and 'dacoity' either for the offence punishable under Section 395 IPC or under Section 397 IPC. However, to bring the case against the accused under Section 397 IPC, the prosecution has to prove one additional fact that the offender has used any deadly weapon or has caused grievous hurt to any person, or has attempted to cause death or grievous hurt to any person. Therefore, the case is made out under Section 391 IPC read with Section 395 IPC. Despite the fact that the courts below convicted the accused 36 under Section 397 IPC which is held to be unsustainable, in that case also if the case is made out under Section 391 IPC read with Section 395 IPC, still they can be convicted for the offence punishable under Section 391 read with Section 395 IPC even without even altering the charge." In this case, in FIR there was a reference to five persons involved in committing the robbery. Even the charge-sheet was filed against five persons. However, as two accused absconded, the trial was split and three accused came to be tried. Thus one another contention raised by the accused was that no case is made out for the offence under Section 391 IPC and they cannot be punished under Section 395 IPC as what is required to be proved is involvement of five or more persons conjointly in committing the robbery and in the present case only four persons are tried and the prosecution has failed to prove the involvement of five or more persons. In this regard, the court said: "Merely because some of the accused absconded and less than five persons came to be tried in the trial, it cannot be said that the offence under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC is not made out. What is required to be considered is the involvement and commission of the offence of robbery by five persons or more and not whether five or more persons were tried. Once it is found on evidence that five or more persons conjointly committed the offence of robbery or attempted to commit the robbery a case would fall under Section 391 IPC and would fall within the definition of 'dacoity'."  The court also rejected the contention that, since in a subsequent trial one of the co- accused came to be acquitted and therefore the benefit of acquittal must be given to the present accused. In this regard, the court observed: "At the outset, it is required to be noted that the accused are to be tried and convicted on the basis of evidence made in the trial in which they are convicted. It is also required to be noted that Benny came to be tried after a period of 15 years as his trial was split as he absconded. From the judgment and order of acquittal passed in the case of Benny, it appears that PW1 during the trial in case of Benny turned hostile. In the case of Benny only five witnesses came to be examined and for whatever reasons other witnesses have not been examined. In the present case PW1 not only supported the case of prosecution but as many as 15 witnesses came to be examined. Therefore, merely because in the subsequent split trial the Benny came to be acquitted the benefit of such acquittal cannot be in favour of the present appellants – accused as the prosecution has been successful in proving the case against the present accused" Partly allowing the appeal, the bench set aside the conviction of the accused under Section 397 IPC and convicted them for the offences under Section 391 IPC punishable under Section 395 IPC and sentenced to undergo seven years Rigorous Imprisonment.  Case name : Ganesan vs State | LL 2021 SC 614 Case no. and Date: CrA 903 OF 2021 | 29 October 2021 Coram: Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah        
The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently dismissed an appeal preferred by a woman against the judgment and decree of the Family Court whereby her husband's petition seeking dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce had been allowed and he had been granted a divorce. The Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma noted that in the instant case, enough mental cruelty had been caused to the husband by the acts of the wife, and thus, the Court went on to dismiss her appeal. The case in brief The marriage of appellant-wife (Harbans Kaur) was solemnized with respondent-Husband (Joginder Pal) in December 1992. In May 2011, the appellant-wife filed a petition under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, and the same was dismissed. Appeal against the said order was also dismissed. The Appellant-wife also got registered an FIR under Sections 323, 325, 506, and 34 IPC against the respondent-husband but in that case, he was acquitted.  In his petition seeking a divorce, the Husband stated that the wife had tried to take forcible possession of the agricultural land owned and possessed by him, and presently, a civil suit against the appellant is pending in District Courts, Karnal.  It was further alleged that the appellant-wife was living in adultery with some person in the year 2012 and she forcibly turned out the respondent along with his four children from the house.  Since then, the husband has been living in a rented house and no cohabitation had taken place between them. Further, when the marriage of their daughter was fixed by the respondent-husband, he requested the wife to join the marriage but she taunted that she had no concern with the respondent and his children.  Against this backdrop, the divorce petition was filed by the Husband. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the Supreme Court had held that even one complaint lodged by the wife found to be false against the husband and his family members amounted to cruelty.  "Even if husband and wife are staying together and husband does not speak to the wife, it would cause mental cruelty and a spouse staying away by sending vulgar and defamatory letters or notices or filing complaints containing indecent allegations or by initiating number of judicial proceedings can make the life of other spouse miserable," the Court added. Further, the Court, taking into account the facts of the case, noted that after the acquittal in the FIR and dismissal of the domestic violence complaint against the Husband, it could be said that enough mental cruelty had been caused to him. Consequently, the wife's appeal was dismissed. Case title: Harbans Kaur v. Joginder Pal [FAO-M-272 of 2017]   
The Supreme Court observed that a court has to reject a plaint if it finds that none of the reliefs sought in it can be granted to the plaintiff under the law.In such a case, it will be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation so that further judicial time is not wasted, the bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai observed.The court added that underlying object of Order VII Rule... The Supreme Court observed that a court has to reject a plaint if it finds that none of the reliefs sought in it can be granted to the plaintiff under the law. In such a case, it will be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation so that further judicial time is not wasted, the bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai observed. The court added that underlying object of Order VII Rule 11 of CPC is that when a plaint does not disclose a cause of action, the court would not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the proceedings. In this case, a civil suit was filed by the plaintiffs before the Calcutta High Court claiming various reliefs in connection with assets and properties of the firm "Soorajmull Nagarmull". The case of the plaintiffs is that in spite of demise of the three original partners of the partnership firm, through whom the plaintiffs were claiming, the defendants have been carrying on the business of the partnership firm.   The defendants filed application seeking rejection of the plaint on the ground that the plaint does not disclose any cause of action, and the relief as claimed in the plaint could not be granted. Though the single bench dismissed these applications, they were allowed by the Division Bench. In appeal, the appellant contended that the Division Bench, in the impugned judgment and order, has almost conducted a mini-­trial to find out as to whether the relief as claimed in the plaint could be granted or not. That, such an exercise is impermissible while considering an 6 application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. On the other hand respondents, contended that, if the reliefs, as sought in the plaint, cannot be granted, then the only option available to the Court is to reject the plaint. In this regard, the bench referred to the judgments in T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal (1977) 4 SCC 467 and Pearlite Liners (P) Ltd. v. Manorama Sirsi (2004) 3 SCC 172) and observed: 15. It could thus be seen that this Court has held that reading of the averments made in the plaint should not only be formal but also meaningful. It has been held that if clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, and a meaningful reading thereof would show that the pleadings are manifestly vexatious and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, then the court should exercise its power under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. It has been held that such a suit has to be nipped in the bud at the first hearing itself. 17. It could thus be seen that the court has to find out as to whether in the background of the facts, the relief, as claimed in the plaint, can be granted to the plaintiff. It has been held that if the court finds that none of the reliefs sought in the plaint  can be granted to the plaintiff under the law, the question then arises is as to whether such a suit is to be allowed to continue and go for trial. This Court answered the said question by holding that such a suit should be thrown out at the threshold. This Court, therefore, upheld the order passed by the trial court of rejecting the suit and that of the appellate court, thereby affirming the decision of the trial court. This Court set aside the order passed by the High Court, wherein the High Court had set aside the concurrent orders of the trial court and the appellate court and had restored and remanded the suit for trial to the trial court. The court said that it is in agreement with the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court which came to the conclusion that the reliefs as sought in the plaint, cannot be granted. While dismissing the appeal, the court further observed: 20. It could thus be seen that this Court has held that the power conferred on the court to terminate a civil action is a drastic one, and the conditions enumerated under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC are required to be strictly adhered to. However, under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC, the duty is cast upon the court to determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action, by scrutinizing the averments in the plaint, read in conjunction with the documents relied upon, or whether the suit is barred by any law. This Court has held that the underlying object of Order VII Rule 11 of CPC is that when a plaint does not disclose a cause of action, the court would not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the proceedings. It has been held that in such a case, it will be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation so that further judicial time is not wasted.   Case name: Rajendra Bajoria Vs.

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that writing a letter to the husband's superior at work in good faith intimating him about a criminal case lodged against the husband for inflicting torture would not amount to criminal defamation under Section 499 of the IPC. In the instant case, the wife (petitioner) had written a letter dated May 24, 1997 to the Manager, Indian Overseas... The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday observed that writing a letter to the husband's superior at work in good faith intimating him about a criminal case lodged against the husband for inflicting torture would not amount to criminal defamation under Section 499 of the IPC.  In the instant case, the wife (petitioner) had written a letter dated May 24, 1997 to the Manager, Indian Overseas Bank intimating him that her husband who was the Assistant Manager of Overseas Bank had tortured her and driven her out of the matrimonial home and that a criminal case under Section 498A CrPC (cruelty) had been initiated against him following which he had been arrested and subsequently released on bail. The petitioner had enclosed a certified copy of the order and had requested the Manager to take such action as may be deemed fit under the facts and circumstances. Justice Ananda Kumar Mukherjee noted that the petitioner in her letter had made representation of facts which were consistent with the incidents relating to filling of cases for alleged torture. He further opined that there had been no 'embellishment of facts' and that no coercive action had been sought by the petitioner against her husband vide the letter.  "There remains little to be said that the letter in question was a statement of fact instead of any imputation to harm the reputation of the opposite party", the Court observed.  Justice Mukherjee further noted that there was matrimonial discord between the petitioner and her husband to such an extent that the wife was compelled to leave her husband's home with her minor daughter. Opining that it is obvious for the petitioner to take recourse to writing such a letter to her husband's superiors under such oppressive conditions, the Court remarked further,  "This incident itself would heap insult and indignation upon a married lady having a child. Under such oppressive conditions it is only obvious that the petitioner would take recourse to writing such letter to Official Heads of the opposite party. The petitioner wife cannot be faulted for taking recourse to law of the land for protection of herself and her daughter. She should have her right to ventilate her grievance as her human dignity was at peril." Opining further that the the ingredients of offence of defamation are not attracted by the contents of the letter as they are covered by the Eighth Exception laid down under Section 499 IPC, the Court underscored, "..preferring an accusation against any person to any of the persons who have lawful authority over that person, would not amount to defamation. In the instant case the petitioner wife made accusation against the opposite party before his superior in office in good faith and consistent to her accusation made in the petition of complaint. Therefore, the same would not amount to any defamation as the same is excepted in the 8th exception." It was also noted that any representation made by a person in good faith for protecting his/her own interest would not amount to defamation as the Ninth Exception under Section 499 IPC protects imputations made in good faith by person for protection of his or other's interests.  The Court further observed that the Fifth Exception under Section 499 IPC stipulates that a representation would not amount to defamation if an opinion is expressed on the merits of any case in good faith which has been decided by a Court in respect of the conduct of a person. "In the instant case on the basis of the material available in the Case Diary the bail of the opposite party was rejected by the court. Therefore, subsequent acquittal of the opposite party cannot undo his arrest and his released on bail by the court, therefore such representation when made in the letter would be covered by the 5th exception of section 499 of IPC", the Court remarked further.  It was further taken into consideration that the letter had been addressed to the husband's superiors on May 24, 1997 whereas the complaint had been filed by the husband against the petitioner for criminal defamation only on June 8, 2009 that is twelve long years after the cause of action arose. It was further held that the complaint filed under Section 200 CrPC by the husband against the petitioner alleging the offence of criminal defamation is barred by the law of limitation under Section 468 CrPC. Pursuant to Section 469(1)(a) of the CrPC, the period of limitation for taking cognizance in an offence under section 500 of IPC is three years from the date of its initiation. Accordingly, the Court observed that case initiated by the husband is barred by limitation as the date of offence should be construed from the date of issuing the letter, that is on May 24, 1997. Placing reliance on the Allahabad High Court decision in Naresh Chand Jain Vs. State of U.P and others and on the Calcutta High Court judgment in Rabindra Nath Pal v. Ratikanta Paul & others the Court opined that a case for the offence of defamation should be filed within three years from the date of publication.  Thus, the Court set aside the complaint lodged by the husband against the petitioner for the offence of defamation by observing that the same is barred by limitation and thus a continuation of such proceedings would lead to an abuse of the process of Court.

The Meghalaya High Court has held that a plaintiff may file application under Section 151 r/w Order XX Rule 6A, where suit filed by him is conclusively decided but no formal decree was drawn to that effect.

The Meghalaya High Court has held that a plaintiff may file application under Section 151 r/w Order XX Rule 6A, where suit filed by him is conclusively decided but no formal decree was drawn to that effect.  A Single Bench of Justice H. S. Thangkhiew observed,   "These being matters of procedure, in the considered view of this Court, as there was no decree drawn up, the petitioner is required to file an application under Section 151 read with Order 20 Rule 6-A CPC, before the lower Court below for drawing the decree in accordance with the order dated 04.07.2016."  Factual Background:  A title suit was instituted by the petitioners as plaintiffs before the Court of the Assistant to Deputy Commissioner, Ri Bhoi District, Nongpoh, which in the course of proceedings resulted in a compromise between the parties. Thereafter, a compromise petition dated 07.06.2016, was filed before the Court below and the entire suit was disposed of by order dated 04.07.2016.  Due to the non-compliance of the terms of compromise by the respondents, the petitioners approached the Learned Lower Court for execution of the compromise deed dated 04.07.2016. The Learned Court below vide orders dated 02.07.2019 and 13.08.2019, appointed a Bailiff to act as a mediator to conduct local inspection to make proper measurements of the respective lands of the parties and to file report before the Court, which was filed on 19.08.2019.   The respondents through their counsel filed objection in the said Execution Case and the Court entertained their objection and disposed of the suit vide the impugned order dated 18.02.2020, by holding that there was no decree drawn up in terms of the compromise agreement dated 04.07.2016. It directed the parties to solve their own disputes and concluded by allowing the objection application of the respondents against the application for execution, which had been made by the petitioners under Order 21 Rule 15 of the CPC. Being aggrieved by the order, the petitioners have filed this revision petition.  Contentions:  Advocate S.R. Lyngdoh, counsel for the petitioner has referred to the judgment of S. Satnam Singh & Ors. v. Surender Kaur & Anr., wherein it was held that to determine the question as to whether, an order passed by the Court is a decree or not, it has to satisfy five tests, viz.  (i) There must be an adjudication;  (ii) Such adjudication must have been given in a suit;  (iii) It must have determined the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit;  (iv) Such determination must be of a conclusive nature; and  (v) There must be a formal expression of such adjudication.  He argues that the instant suit has satisfied the tests, inasmuch as, there was such an adjudication in the suit determining the rights of the parties, which was conclusive in nature and that the formal expression was in the form of the petition. Also, the terms of compromise were detailed therein, signed by both the parties and endorsed by the Court.  He thus contended that, the impugned order is patently irregular and bad in law, in as much, it accepted the objections of the respondents and held that there was no decree to be executed, thereby disallowing the prayer of the petitioner.  Noteworthy to mention that despite notice and multiple adjournments, the respondents did not appear. Therefore, the Court chose to proceed ex parte against them.   Court's Observations:  The Court noted the provision dealing with compromise of suit under Order XXIII Rule 3, CPC. It observed that the provision contemplates that after the Court records the compromise as was done in the instant case vide order dated 04.07.2016, it shall proceed to pass a decree. However, in the present case even though the compromise deed was to the satisfaction of the learned Lower Court and the title suit was disposed of in terms of the said compromise, no formal decree was drawn up.  The Court relied on the case of Sir Sobha Singh and Sons Pvt. Ltd. v. Shashi Mohan Kapur (Deceased), on a similar question, the Apex Court has held that an execution application even if filed without a certified copy of the decree would be maintainable, and that it empowered the Executing Court to entertain the execution application and to decide the objections raised on merits.  The Highest Court in that case also observed that so long as the formal decree is not passed, the order was to be treated as a decree during the interregnum period by virtue of Order XX Rule 6A(2) of the Code. In other words, notwithstanding the fact that the decree had not been passed, yet by virtue of principle underlined in Order XX Rule 6A(2) of the Code, the order had the effect of a decree till the date of actual passing of the decree by the Court for the purposes of execution or for any other purpose. This empowered the Executing Court to entertain the execution application and decide the objections raised by the respondent on merits.  Having regard for the dictum laid down by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid case, the Court consequently set aside the impugned order of the lower Court. It also directed that the execution application on the preparation of the decree and the filing of the certified copy thereof, shall be taken up by the Executing Court. No objection shall be entertained by the Court below in the preparation of the decree as it is only a formality that is to be completed in terms of the compromise.

No prohibition on incorporating a non-citizen as legal guardian in the passport of a minor child.The Kerala High Court recently ruled that even if one of the parents of a minor child refused to give consent, the passport issuing authority is entitled to issue a passport to the minor, provided the requisite form is submitted.While allowing the petition of a minor girl, Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas also observed that there is no legal prohibition in incorporating a non-citizen as the... The Kerala High Court recently ruled that even if one of the parents of a minor child refused to give consent, the passport issuing authority is entitled to issue a passport to the minor, provided the requisite form is submitted. While allowing the petition of a minor girl, Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas also observed that there is no legal prohibition in incorporating a non-citizen as the legal guardian in the passport of a minor child. "Since the petitioner was born in India and her domicile of origin is India and when her biological father continues to be an Indian citizen, the objection raised by the respondents in issuing an Indian Passport, based purely on her mother being an American citizen is, to say the least, odious and legally unsustainable", the Court observed. The Judge further laid down that one parent being a citizen of another country will not by itself disentitle a child born in India and whose other parent is an Indian citizen to be issued with an Indian passport. "...the petitioner, though a minor and a child, is still "someone, even today". Petitioner's right to travel, her right to enjoy her nationality and her right to enjoy her citizenship cannot be ignored." The petitioner girl's parents had dissolved their marriage by mutual consent and the mother was appointed a legal guardian despite being an American citizen with visitorial rights to the father, subject to the mutual convenience of parties.  After the dissolution of marriage, the mother remarried and intends to take the petitioner abroad to live along with her. But when an application for a passport was submitted, the passport issuing authority insisted on the consent from the petitioner's biological father and refused to accept the application without it. The minor girl thereby approached the Court seeking a direction to issue her a passport without insisting on consent from her biological father. She also sought directions to issue the passport to her, including details of her stepfather. Advocate Dr. Abhilash O.U appearing for the petitioner argued that her parents had been living apart since 2011, and in such circumstances, compelling the petitioner to produce the consent of the biological father is not legally required. It was also asserted that the petitioner is an Indian citizen by birth and that her mother, though a citizen of the United States, has been registered as an Overseas Citizen of India. ASGI S. Manu assisted by Central Government Counsel Jaishankar V. Nair appearing for the respondents argued that as per the Passport Manual, 2020, if visitation rights have been granted as per court orders, consent of the other parent is required to process the application for issuance of a passport to a minor.  Further, it was contended that if one of the parents willfully refuse to give consent or inordinately delays grant of consent, the passport can be issued to the child, after receipt of an affidavit (Annexure-C) obtained from the parent having custody of the child.  They further pleaded that as per the Passport Manual, when one parent has renounced Indian citizenship and the other parent is still an Indian citizen, the citizenship of the minor shall be of that person who has legal custody of that child and the eligibility of an Indian passport will be determined on the basis of the guardian's citizenship. The father appearing through Advocates Shahul Hameed, K.M. Varghese and T.A Niyas however submitted that he has no objection to issuing the passport to the petitioner without insisting on his consent. The Court initiated the judgment quoting Stacia Tauscher, an Irish artist: "We worry about what a child will become tomorrow, yet we forget that he is someone today." The Judge then expressed appreciation for the father's willingness to let the mother take their child abroad with her, considering the child's welfare to have a better education and the need of an adolescent girl to have maternal care. "The aforementioned willingness expressed by the father of the petitioner is indeed creditworthy, indicative of the parent acting in the interests of the welfare of the child and worthy of emulation by other similar parents."  The Court dealt with three issues in the case:  (i) Whether the consent of both parents are required to issue a passport to a minor child? It was noted that the father had no objection to his child being issued an Indian passport.  More importantly, the authority could not legally insist on consent from both parents either. As per the Passport Manual, if an affidavit is filed in the form of Annexure-C of Schedule III of the Passport Rules, 1980, the passport issuing authority can issue a passport to a minor, without insisting upon the consent of both parents. Therefore, it was held that even if one of the parents of a minor child refused to give consent, the passport issuing authority is entitled to issue a passport to the minor, provided Annexure-C is submitted. "Thus, if the petitioner submits the relevant form as per the Passport Rules, 1980, the respondents are bound to process the application for issuance of a passport to the petitioner." (ii) Whether the minor child is disentitled to get an Indian passport if one of the parents is a citizen of another country? The petitioner's mother was always an American citizen, hence the question of termination or renouncement of citizenship of one parent does not arise. So it was ruled that the petitioner having acquired Indian citizenship by birth as per Section 3 of Citizenship Act, 1955 cannot be regarded as a stateless child by reason of her mother being an American citizen. "Law abhors such statelessness of children. The comity of nations ensures that every person must have a nationality so that all rights accrue to that individual as a national of that particular country. Though nationality and citizenship are not synonymous terms, the concept of nationality cannot be ignored while considering the citizenship of a minor child, especially when the statute confers citizenship by birth." Since the petitioner was born in India and her domicile of origin is India and when her biological father continues to be an Indian citizen, the objection raised by the respondents in issuing an Indian Passport, based purely on her mother being an American citizen was held to be odious and legally unsustainable. Therefore, the Court took the view that merely because one parent acquired the citizenship of another country or if one parent is not a citizen of India, will not by itself, disentitle a child born in India and whose other parent is an Indian citizen to be issued with an Indian passport.  As such, it was observed that the petitioner is entitled to be issued with an Indian passport. (iii) Whether the passport can be issued mentioning only the name of the legal guardian?  None of the parties could bring to the notice of the Court any legal prohibition in incorporating the name of a non-citizen as the legal guardian in the passport of a minor child. Hence, the Court held that the petitioner's passport can be issued with the name of her mother as legal guardian. As such, it was held that the petitioner is entitled to be issued with an Indian passport with the name of her mother endorsed not only as a mother but even as the legal guardian in the passport to be issued. The passport issuing authority was thereby directed to process the petitioner's application within three weeks.  Case Title: Chaitanya S. Nair (minor) v. Union of India & Ors.     
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently dismissed a ‘cryptic’ delay condonation application for not giving proper account of dates. A bench comprising Justice MA Chowdhary observed,  "Courts cannot come to aid and rescue of litigant where application for condonation does not spell out sufficient cause and the approach of petitioners, in making such application in casual and cryptic manner".  The observations were made while hearing an application in terms of which the petitioner was seeking the indulgence of the Court in condoning the delay of 963 days in filing the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal against an award dated passed by Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal ( District Judge) Samba.  Pressing their prayer for condoning the delay the applicants submitted that their counsel did not inform them about the passing of the impugned award; that they only came to know about the passing of the impugned judgment few days back; that, thereafter they immediately got the certified copy of the judgment and contacted a counsel at Jammu who advised filing of appeal.   Observing that Law of Limitation has to be applied with all its vigor and rigor as prescribed by the statute, Justice Chowdhary stated that one cannot escape the consequences of the provisions of the ‘Law of Limitation’ which provide that for the extension of the period of limitation in a given case, the condition precedent is that the applicants have to satisfy the Court that they have carved out a sufficient cause in seeking the indulgence of the Court for not preferring the appeal or application within the stipulated time.   Pointing out to the fact that the application is based on the ground that their counsel had not informed them about the passing of the Award, the court said there is a huge delay of 963 days in filing the appeal and no satisfactory explanation has come forward on that count except for routine words and phrases. Frowning over the negligence of the applicants in prosecuting their case within time, the court said the application appears to have been drafted recklessly without giving a proper account of the dates and details of the grounds agitated in it and recourse has been had to the leisure and pleasure in moving the application  "Blaming their counsel by the applicants, in the considered opinion of this court for a huge delay of 963 days, is of no help to condone this reckless delay", the bench concluded while dismissing the plea.

The Allahabad High Court last week granted bail to 2 real brothers who have been accused of committing gang-rape upon a victim as the Court noted that she, after leveling the allegations, never admitted for any medical examination so as to establish the fact of gang rape upon her. "This is the serious matter wherein the attending circumstances, it is required to establish the authenticity of the allegations. It is mandatory and obligatory on the part of the victim to get herself medically examined so as to substantiate the allegation of rape. It is not her choice to admit or not to admit for the medical examination," the bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi observed while granting bail to 2 real brothers/accused. The case in brief  The Court was dealing with two criminal appeals filed assailing the legality and validity of the order passed by the Special Judge (SC/ST Act)/Additional Sessions Judge, Allahabad rejecting the Bail Application of the appellants in a case registered against them under Sections 328, 343, 376-D, 504, 506 I.P.C. and Section 3(2)V of the S.C./S.T. Act. As per the allegations in the F.I.R., the victim was kidnapped by some unknown persons, who made her unconscious and thereafter confined her into a room. They used to administer her liquor and misbehaved with her time and again.  Allegedly, this continued for another period of one week and thereafter, they left her in an abandoned condition near the railway crossing. She positively identified all three named persons (real brothers) for committing gang rape upon her. Importantly, the counsel for the appellants submitted that the victim/ informant and her mother are in the habit of making such a type of frivolous F.I.Rs.  Court's observations  Noting that the victim refused to get herself medically examined, the Court observed that the Apex Court, in its various pronouncements has clearly opined that it is risky to blindly rely upon victims 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. statements without having any supporting, independent documentary proof or any other confidence generating material collected during the investigation. "After leveling such a serious allegation against three real brothers, contentions raised that it is highly improbable that three real brothers could commit a gang rape with a lady, coupled with the fact that she has never admitted for any medical examination so as to connect the allegation of rape upon her," the Court observed as it allowed the appeals and granted them bail.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has directed the State Government to ensure timely administration of Amphotericin B and other medicines to Black fungus patients in the State while observing that no patient must suffer from lack of medicines. A Bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Vijay Kumar Shukla also directed the Additional Chief Secretary of the Department of Medical and Health, Government of Madhya Pradesh to place on record the exact position with regard to number of patients of black and white fungus or any other kind of similar disease, in the State. The Court clarified that the medicines should surely be prescribed to the patients by the treating doctors not only in Jabalpur but also in Hospitals of the other cities including Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal and elsewhere in the State. The order was passed after Senior Advocate Naman Nagrath with Advocate Jubin Prasad appointed as amicus curiae, apprised the Court that family members of more than 50 patients of black fungus, admitted in Government Hospital at Jabalpur, had gheraoed the officials of the Government as they were not provided with Amphotericin – B medicine, endangering life of the patients. The development came after the State Government had filed the 11th Action Taken Report in compliance of the earlier order highlighting various issues concerning the covid-19 situation in the State. According to the report, it was stated that out of 188 oxygen generation plants, 61 plants we already commissioned, equipment for 13 more plants was delivered by the concerned agency and that installation process was in progress. It was also stated that as per the estimate of the State Government, the remaining plants will be installed by 30th September, 2021.  Furthermore, out of 52 district hospitals of the State, C.T. Scan Machines were functional in 14 districts and that steps were taken to install CT Scan Machine in the remaining districts as well, the Bench was told. As per the supplies of vaccines so far received, the Court was informed that the State was expected to be in a position to cover the entire 18 plus population by inoculation with the first dose by the end of September, 2021.  It was also stated that due to focused and concentrated efforts by the Government, a full immunization cover would be provided to the entire 18 plus population by the end of December, 2021. "This Court places on record its appreciation of the work so far undertaken by the State Government with regard to the establishment of oxygen plants, CT Scan Machines and Oxygen/ICU/HDU/PICU beds in all District Government Hospitals of the State. This Court appreciates the all out efforts put in by the officials of the State and applauds its performance with regard to inoculation of the sizeable population of the State that it shall by the end of September, would provide the safety cover of immunization of first dose to entire 18 plus population and has given the hope that all such people shall be provided with full immunization cover by the end of the year 2021," the Court said. The matter will now be considered on September 6. Title: In Reference (Suo Motu) vs. Union of India and others   
The Kerala High Court recently asked the government to come out with suggestions, including on legislative intervention, to curtail the attacks on medical personnel.  The Division Bench of Justice Devan Ramachandran and Justice Kauser Edappagath said whatever be the provocation or reason that anyone may impel or project, an attack on a medical personnel is unacceptable and non-negotiable.  "The Government, therefore, has to now tell us the modus to ensure such attacks never take place, because what we are concerned about is not the action after such an attack, but the prevention itself," the court said. The court said it cannot approve of the attacks on doctors and medical personnel, whatever be the reason.  "We are indicating this because, we get the feeling that there is an attempt – perhaps unintended – to justify the attacks in one form or the other," it observed.   The court further said that the civil society would also have to be sensitized to counter such attacks.  "...it is our firm belief that unless the Civil society is properly sensitized, as also the doctors, the unfortunate strife at least in a very few cases, will continue. Our endeavor is to end this and we, therefore, call upon the Government to come out with firm suggestions including, legislative, if they have any in mind," said the court  As time was sought by the Government Pleader S. Kannan to respond to court's suggestions, and also taking note that two or three attacks had already occurred while the court was seized of the issue, the bench posted the case for further consideration on March 30.

The Supreme Court has observed that the principle of res judicata will apply to execution proceedings as well. The Court added that a judgment debtor cannot raise objections to executions in installments. A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasburmanian made this observation while rejecting a new objection raised by a judgment-debtor against the auction-sale proceedings in the fifth round. To stall the execution of the decree which was passed in 1974 in a money-suit filed for recovering Rs.3000, the legal representatives of the judgment debtors, in the fifth round of litigation, filed a fresh application under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the ground that the sale did not follow the mandate of Rule 64 of the Order XXI of the CPC. Rule 64 states, in essence, that only that portion of the property should be sold so as to satisfy the decree amount. The application was rejected first by the trial court, and then by the appellate court and the High Court. The matter was ultimately carried to the Supreme Court by way of further appeal. The Supreme Court noted that the objection as regards Rule 64 was not raised at earlier rounds, and was raised for the first time in 2006. The party had sufficient opportunities to raise this objection at earlier rounds. "A judgment­-debtor cannot be allowed to raise objections as to the method of execution in instalments. After having failed to raise the issue in four earlier rounds of litigation, the appellants cannot be permitted to raise it now", the judgment authored by Justice Ramasubramanian observed. The judgment explained the the principle of res judicata will apply to Execution Proceedings as well. "What is on hand is a second petition under Section 47 and, hence, it is barred by res judicata. It must be pointed out at this stage that before Act 104 of 1976 came into force, there was one view that the provisions of Section 11 of the Code had no application to execution proceedings. But under Act 104 of 1976 Explanation VII was inserted under Section 11 and it says that the provisions of this Section shall apply to a proceeding for the execution of a decree and reference in this Section to any suit, issue or former suit shall be construed as references to a proceeding for the execution of the decree, question arising in such proceeding and a former proceeding for the execution of that decree" Editor's Note : Since the ground of defence was not raised in the earlier proceedings, it will be hit by the principle of "constructive res judicata", as per which the grounds which ought to have been raised in the previous proceedings are also presumed to have been matters which are directly and substantially issues in the previous proceedings. Explanation IV to Section 11 CPC may be referred.

The Allahabad High Court recently upheld the life sentence of a convict in a murder case that dates back to the year 2002 while stressing that there is no prohibition that the police personnel should not record dying declaration and that such a dying declaration is also admissible in evidence. The Bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Vikas Budhwar further noted there might be certain defects in the investigation so conducted by the Investigating Officer, but the same cannot ipso facto be a ground to hold that the appellants are not guilty, as there exists ocular and documentary evidence, which proves that the appellants have committed the murder of the deceased. The Facts in brief  An FIR was registered on February 15, 2002, on the basis of the information provided by the complainant, alleging that at 7 o'clock in the morning, he, along with his brother Latheru Ram (Deceased) had gone to the field, when suddenly both the appellants appeared there and they hurled abuses and threatened to kill the complainant and his brother on account of an old rivalry. Thereafter, the appellants took out their country-made pistol and with the intention of killing the complainant and his brother, fired on them. Though the complainant escaped the injury, his brother sustained bullet injuries on his stomach as well as left hand, and thereafter, he became totally unconscious and fell down. The deceased was first brought to his house, and after waiting for 20-25 minutes, thereafter, they all proceeded for the police station, which was 8 km away from the house, in a jeep, and then the FIR was lodged at 08:10 a.m.  It had come on record that PW-7 being the Sub-Inspector Indraprakash had recorded the dying declaration and according to him, the deceased had named the appellants with respect to the commission of the offence. Later on, the deceased was sent to District Hospital at Sultanpur as his condition was quite critical wherein he succumbed to the armed injuries at 09:45 a.m. After concluding the investigation, the investigating officer submitted a charge sheet against the accused Prem Nath Yadav and Sanjay Yadav. The trial court framed charges against them u/s 302/34, 504, 506 IPC and Section 3(1) U.P. Gangster Act and Anti Social (Prevention) Act, 1986 and after conducting the trial, convicted them under the said offences. Thus, the appellants moved the instant appeal against the judgment and order dated 11.09.2015 passed by Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge Gangster, Sultanpur. Submissions put forth It was primarily argeud by the appellants that dying declaration in the instant case was recorded by the police personnel and further the certificate of fitness was also not obtained from the doctor. In this regard, it was contended that there is a cloud regarding the fact that as to whether the dying declaration was recorded or not, as according to the learned counsel for the appellants, the deceased was in a critical condition and he might have died before the recording of the dying declaration The observations made by the Court The Court noted that the deceased was brought to the police station at 08:00-08:10 a.m. on 15.02.2022 and the medico-legal report was prepared at 09:20 a.m. and between 09:20 and 09:45 a.m, the dying declaration was recorded by the police personnel, when the deceased named the appellants, who had committed the offence.  Significantly, the Court opined that the time for recording the dying declaration was too short to wait for the Magistrate to arrive or take a certificate of fitness from the doctor as in the case in hand, PW-7 waited either for the doctor or for the Magistrate to arrive, then by that time, it would have been too late for recording the dying declaration. Against this backdrop, the Court observed thus: "This Court has to adopt a pragmatic approach as this Court cannot travel into the mind of the person, who was recording the dying declaration, as he was the best-suited person to take a decision for recording the dying declaration. Nonetheless, there is nothing on record to suggest that there was any animosity of PW-7 with the appellants. There is also no cross-examination conducted by the defence on the question of the dying declaration...Dying declaration cannot be merely discarded on the ground that the same has been recorded by police personnel or certificate of fitness was not obtained." With this, the Court also discarded the arguments of the Applennats that there were certain defects in the probe as the court observed that the investigation by itself cannot be a ground for acquittal and it is the legal obligation of the Court to examine the prosecution evidence dehors such lapses carefully to find out whether the said evidence is reliable or not. "Notably, there exists dying declaration of the deceased, statement of PW-1 (complainant) as well as the relevant fact that the appellants could not produce any evidence to show that they are entitled to the benefit of alibi and other crucial facts that the motive stood proved, as it also acted as a catalyst for the commission of the crime," the Court held in the end as it dismissed the appeal of the appellants.

Section 68 of the Act of 1872 reads as follows:  Proof of execution of document required by law to be attested.—If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the Court and capable of giving evidence…  Justice AP Thaker made this observation while hearing a property dispute suit wherein the will and its execution was under the microscope.  Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree of the Appellate Court, Surat the original defendant had preferred the instant Second Appeal under Section 100 of CPC.   The respondent had filed a Suit against the present appellant for partition of property alleging that the properties were of joint family and thus he was ought to be given possession of his half in the suit property.   The trial Court had dismissed the suit of the respondent against which the he had filed First Appeal No. 33/1981, wherein the First Appellate Court had allowed the same.  The first appellate Court had interfered with the decision of the trial Court regarding the execution of the Will by the deceased on the following grounds:   1.There is no description of the properties in the Will.  2.There is recital in the Will that the deceased has only one son, whereas he had two sons.  3.There is discrepancy of the oral evidence of the important witnesses of the defendant regarding the colour of the thumb impression i.e. blue or black of the deceased.  4. There is contradictory version of the defendant witness regarding purchase of the stamp.  5. There is contradictory evidence of the defendant's witness as to whether the drafting of the Will was done while they were sitting either on the Otta of the house of the scribe or in the interior room of the scribe namely Gemalsinh.  6.Non-examination of the scribe i.e. Gemalsinh of the Will.  7.That the deceased was suffering from Paralysis and he was not in a position to execute Will as he was ill before the time of his death.  8. The registration of the Will after the death of the deceased.  It was is crystal clear, held the Court, that the suit properties were self-acquired properties of the deceased Diwala Gausa, who was the executor of the Will.   As regards the capacity to execute or make a Will as well as construction of Will, the Court relied on the provisions contained in Section 59 and 82 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925.  "In view of the aforesaid provision, even a person who are deaf or dumb or blind can make a Will if they are able to do what they do by it. Not only that, even a person who is insane may make a Will during interval if he is of sound mind. Therefore, under Section 59, only rider for non-capability of making Will is of being minor who is prohibited to dispose of his property by Will. Except minor, as provided in explanation under Section 59, other persons, as referred to above, can execute Will."  The appellate Court' reliance on the fact that the scribe of the Will was not examined by the defendant was not found to be in consonance with the legal requirement for the proof of the Will.  The first Appellate Courts' observation that the testator in his Will had mentioned that he has only one son, to doubt the genuineness of the Will was found to be incorrect.  On this ground, the Court said that it was well settled principles of law that while interpreting the Will, the entire Will has to be read and construed. There cannot be reading of the Will piece-meal, said the Court.  On reading of the Will, it was found that there was clear averment that the deceased has other son namely Akho, who residing with his father-in-law and has left his father and had never taken care of him.  Thus it was natural for the deceased Diwala Gause to exclude his own son from getting any share in the self-acquired properties.  The discrepancy regarding the colour of the ink used for thumb impression of the testator and witnesses thereof, was also found to have no relevance as on perusal of the Will along with the statement recorded therein by the Sub-Registrar, Mandvi it was noted that there were some thumb impressions that were black.  On a perusal of the entire evidence on record, it clearly appeared that all the legal requirements of proving the Will were satisfied and the factum of excluding the plaintiff Akha from the properties by the testator was reflected in the Will itself,   The High Court thus found that the trial Court has correctly held that the Will was executed in the sound state of mind by the deceased and the First Appellate Court had committed serious error of facts and law in passing a decree in favour of plaintiff for 1/2 share in the suit properties.  Accordingly, the present Appeal was allowed and the Judgment and decree passed by the First Appellate Court, Surat i.e. Assistant Judge, Surat was quashed and set-aside.

In a welcome move, the Allahabad High Court has permitted use of A4 Size Paper in its functioning, so as to reduce the environmental cost of paper printing and to make it more economically viable for the litigants.  However, it has not yet permitted printing on both sides of the paper.  The Registrant General has notified the Allahabad High Court (Amendment) Rules,2021 in exercise of its powers under Article 225 of the Constitution of India, thereby allowing the use of A4 Size Paper for all petitions, appeals, applications, etc., to be filed in the High Court.  The amendment comes as a consequence of a petition filed by four law students through Advocates Shashwat Anand and Ankur Azad, seeking permission for use of A4 size paper for all Judicial and Administrative purposes in the High Court, as well as all other Courts, Tribunals and District Courts in Uttar Pradesh. They had also sought permission for printing on both sides of paper.  Remarking that "the matter requires serious consideration on the administrative side", a Bench led by then Chief Justice Govind Mathur had directed the Petitioners to make a representation before the Registrar General, in pursuance of which, the High Court had issued a communication in November last year, stating that the High Court's Administrative Committee has resolved to place the matter before the Rules Committee for necessary amendments in the Allahabad High Court Rules, 1952, General Rules (Civil), 1957 and General Rules (Criminal), 1977.  The High Court has now amended the 1952 Rules to allow filing of petitions, applications, etc. before itself, that are legibly written or printed on one side of A4 size paper (29.7 cm X 2l cm) having not less than 75 GSM and the formatting style of the text shall be as prescribed by the High Court from time to time.  It may be noted that amendments in the General Rules (Civil), 1957 and General Rules (Criminal), 1977, for the purpose of using A4 Size Paper in the district judiciaries, lower courts and tribunals, etc., are yet to be notified   It is also worthwhile to mention that the regime of using A4 size paper with printing on both sides has been adopted and put in place in the Supreme Court of India and several other High Courts, being Kerala High Court, Karnataka High Court, Tripura High Court, Uttarakhand High Court, etc.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Monday stressed that it is the primary responsibility of the State to ensure uninterrupted supply of "consumables and standard kit" to the Forensic Science Laboratory so that DNA tests can be conducted without any difficulty. The Bench of Justice Gurpal Singh Ahluwalia observed thus while dealing with a bail plea filed by the rape accused claiming that since the prosecutrix had turned hostile and had not supported the prosecution case, he was entitled to bail. Importantly, on three occasions, the State submitted before the Court that it could not obtain the DNA test report in the matter, and on October 4, referring to a letter received from FSL, Sagar, the state submitted that "consumables and the standard kit" which is used for conducting DNA test report was not available with the laboratory. In this regard, stressing that DNA rest report is one of the crucial circumstances which may prove the guilt of an accused, the Court observed thus: "Even otherwise, under Section 53-A of Cr.P.C., DNA test is compulsory. Under these circumstances, it is the primary responsibility of the State to ensure uninterrupted supply of 'consumables and standard kit' to the RFSL so that DNA test can be conducted without any difficulty. However, unfortunately RFSL, Sagar is short of "consumables and standard kit" and on account of said shortage, DNA test has come to a halt." Therefore, the Court directed the Director-General of Police to immediately look into the matter and to ensure uninterrupted supply of "consumables and standard kit" to RFSL, Sagar so that DNA test can be conducted as early as possible. Further, regarding the circumstances created due to the unavailability of the DNA report, the Court observed that the prosecution itself was not in a position to provide a DNA test report, and therefore, the Court opined that the complete fault was of the prosecution.  "It is really unfortunate that the prosecution is not serious towards the criminal trial...the accused cannot be allowed to languish in jail for the fault of the prosecution", the Court further added as it directed that the applicant be released on bail, on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rs. One Lac) with one surety in the like amount. Case title - Deepak Tomar Vs. State of MP and anr.  Read Order  
The Supreme Court held that a female member of the scheduled tribe is not entitled to any right of survivorship under the provisions of Hindu Succession Act. The bench of Justices MR Shah and Krishna Murari urged the Central Government to consider whether it is necessary to bring a suitable amendment to Hindu Succession Act in this regard. "To deny the equal right to the daughter belonging to the tribal even after a period of 70 years of the Constitution of India under which right to equality is guaranteed, it is high time for the Central Government to look into the matter and if required, to amend the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act by which the Hindu Succession Act is not made applicable to the members of the Scheduled Tribe." the bench said. Section 2(2) Hindu Succession Act The Section 2(2) reads thus : Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs. Background In this case, Land Acquisition Reference Court rejected the claim of the share of a woman in the compensation, mainly on the ground that as the parties belong to Scheduled Tribe Community, the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act shall not be applicable and therefore she being a daughter shall not be entitled to the share in the amount of compensation. This view was upheld by the Orissa High Court. On Madhu Kishwar judgment Before the Apex Court, the appellant relied on the case of Madhu Kishwar & Ors. Versus State of Bihar & Ors., (1996) 5 SCC 125 to contend that she being a daughter shall be entitled to the share in the amount of compensation even applying the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. The court ntoed that in the case of Madhu Kishwar (supra), the Court had refused to strike down the provisions of Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act, 1908 which provided the succession to property in the male line of heirs and denying the right to Succession to the daughter, on the touchstone of Article 14. "Under the circumstances in view of Section 2(2) of Hindu Succession Act and the appellant being the member of the Scheduled Tribe and as the female member of the Scheduled Tribe is specifically excluded, the appellant is not entitled to any right of survivorship under the provisions of Hindu Succession Act. No error has been committed by the High Court. The appeal therefore deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed." Female tribal is entitled to parity with male tribal in intestate succession While parting with the judgment, the court added that there may not be any justification to deny the right of survivorship so far as the female member of the Tribal is concerned. When the daughter belonging to the non­tribal is entitled to the equal share in the property of the father, there is no reason to deny such right to the daughter of the Tribal community. Female tribal is entitled to parity with male tribal in intestate succession. To deny the equal right to the daughter belonging to the tribal even after a period of 70 years of the Constitution of India under which right to equality is guaranteed, it is high time for the Central Government to look into the matter and if required, to amend the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act by which the Hindu Succession Act is not made applicable to the members of the Scheduled Tribe..Therefore, though we dismiss the present appeal, it is directed to examine the question by the Central Government to consider it just and necessary to withdraw the exemptions provided under the Hindu 12 Succession Act in so far as the applicability of the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act to the Scheduled Tribes and whether to bring a suitable amendment or not. We hope and trust that the Central Government will look into the matter and take an appropriate decision taking into consideration the right to equality guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.

Can't Compel Wife To Live With Muslim Husband Who Has Married Again Against Her Will If It Isn't Equitable: Allahabad High CourtStressing that as per the mandate of the Holy Quran, bigamy is not sanctified unless a man can do justice to orphans, the Allahabad High Court has observed that a Muslim man has to prevent himself to perform a second marriage if he is not capable of fostering his wife and children. "The religious mandate of Sura 4 Ayat 3 (of Quran) is binding on all Muslim men which specifically mandates all Muslim men to deal justly with orphans and then they can marry women of their choice two or three or four but if a Muslim man fears that he will not be able to deal justly with them then only one. If a Muslim man is not capable of fostering his wife and children then as per the above mandate of the Holy Quran, he cannot marry the other woman," the Bench of Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Rajendra Kumar-IV observed. The Court made this observation while dismissing an appeal filed by a Muslim man challenging the family court's order dismissing his suit for restoration of conjugal rights in connection with his first wife (respondent). The case in brief It was the admitted case of the plaintiff-appellant/husband that he contracted a second marriage and did not disclose this fact to his first wife (defendant/respondent), however, he wished to live with both of his wives and since the first wife refused to live with him and share his consortium with another woman, he filed a plea seeking restoration of conjugal rights. Having heard both parties, the Family Court dismissed the husband's plea. Challenging this order, he moved to the High Court by way of filing the instant plea. High court's observations Dismissing his appeal, the High Court specifically observed that when the plaintiff-appellant contracted the second marriage suppressing this fact from his first wife, then such conduct of the plaintiff-appellant amounts to cruelty to his first wife.  Under the circumstances, the Court further held that if the first wife does not wish to live with her husband-plaintiff appellant, then she cannot be compelled to go with him in a suit filed by him for restitution of conjugal rights.  "If the contention of the plaintiff-appellant/ husband for the grant of decree of conjugal rights is accepted, then from point of view of the defendant-respondent/wife, it would amount to a breach of her fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India," he Court remarked. Significantly, taking into account the fact that the husband had married again during the lifetime of his first time, leaving behind children born out of the said marriage, the Court referred to Sura 4 Ayat 3 of the Holy Quran to stress that as per Quran, bigamy is not sanctified unless a man can do justice to orphans, who in the present set of facts are the respondent and her children.  "As per the mandate of the Holy Quran as noted above all Muslim men have to deal justly with orphans. A married Muslim man having his wife alive cannot marry another Muslim woman if he cannot deal justly with the orphan. A mandate has been given that in such circumstances a Muslim man has to prevent himself to perform a second marriage, if he is not capable of fostering his wife and children," the Court remarked as it dismissed the appeal filed by the Husband.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that mere denial of counter signature on a certificate in absence of proper enquiry or finding does not warrant major punishment of termination of service, which becomes punitive in nature particularly when the order of termination is not simpliciter but the stigma is attached to the same. The observations were made by Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal while deciding a bunch of petitions in terms of which the petitioners had challenged their order of termination issued by the Chief Engineer Project beacon C/O 56 APO.   In the instant case the petitioner got appointed to the post of Nursing Assistant however post the selection process, a verification process was initiated by the appointing authority in order to determine the genuineness of the documents submitted by the selected candidates.  Subsequently , it came to fore that the experience certificate of the petitioner was alleged to be forged and as a consequence of which, a Notice of termination came to be issued on September 26th 2009 against the petitioner by the Chief Engineer, Beacon.   On October 14th, 2009 a reply to the notice was submitted by the petitioner and on the basis of recommendations on October 23 2009, the notice of termination was withdrawn in respect of petitioner, for the purpose of directing further enquiry with respect to the same.  On further enquiry the verification certificate was endorsed by Mahajan Hospital in respect of petitioner and it was verified by them that the petitioner had gained the requisite experience in their hospital and the certificate was genuine. However, on May 30th 2011, another order of termination was passed against the petitioner No. 1, whereby, he was given one month notice for termination of his services on 30th June 2011.  Challenging his order of termination the petitioner submitted that he responded to his first termination order through proper channel and clarified the position that the experience certificate furnished by him is not forged but true and correct one and before appointment of the petitioner has a working experience as a Nursing Assistant with the Mahajan Hospital Salapur Maharashtra. The petitioners further argued that they have not furnished or made any declaration which is false or suppressed any material fact.   Contesting the plea, the respondents vehemently argued that the point which has been raised by the petitioner with regard to the relevancy of experience certificate, is false and that the genuineness of experience certificate is in question, as the same has been intimated as “FORGED” by the concerned authority (Counter Signing Authority). Respondents further submitted that after recruitment of candidates for the appropriate posts, GREF Centre (Recruiting Centre), verifies the genuineness of the certificates produced by the candidates. Accordingly, the experience certificate was verified by GREF Centre from District Health Officer, Health Deptt. Zilla Parishad, Slapur and the District Health Officer, Health Deptt. Zilla Parishad Solapur has intimated vide letter No. ZPS/Health/PUB/196/09 dated 09 July 2009, that their office has not countersigned or issued the said certificate to petitioner, respondents averred.  Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Nargal observed that a counter signature is an additional signature added to a document that has already been signed and the counter signature serves to provide reconfirmation of the document’s authenticity.  Pointing out to the contradictions, the court said that the hospital authorities who have first-hand knowledge of the fact that the petitioner has worked with them are validating and verifying the same, however, the countersigning authority is denying the same on the ground that the said authority has not countersigned the experience certificate and the same is forged by the petitioner.  "Even if the allegations leveled against the petitioner are taken to its logical conclusion, this Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the documents already stand proved and verified to the extent of signing as well as verified by the issuing authority", the bench recorded.  Pointing out to the fact that the initial termination order and the final order were based on the same order of denial by of District Health Officer the court said that the only communication post the withdrawal for further investigation, was that of hospital, wherein the said hospital authorities have confirmed about the authenticity and validity of the experience certificate, therefore, it can safely be concluded that the investigation conducted by the respondents is in favor of petitioner No.1 and thus, there was no justification on part of the respondents to issue the second termination order on the same grounds. Rejecting the argument of the respondent that the signature of DHO has been denied and is alleged to be forged the court said that it must be borne in mind that a mere denial will not suffice the purpose in absence of any enquiry or finding recorded by the respondents. "The bar of proving forgery is high and must be supported by sufficient evidence and in absence of any detailed enquiry conducted in this regard, it cannot be assumed that the documents has been forged by the petitioner No.1", the bench explained.  Observing that the validity of the certificate has not been denied by the issuing authority, the court maintained that it is only the counter signature which is denied by the respondents and mere denial of counter signature on a certificate in absence of proper enquiry or finding recorded in this regard does not warrant major punishment of termination of service.  Elaborating further on the matter Justice Nargal observed that the allegations leveled against the petitioner No.1 were never enquired into by conducting a detailed enquiry or associating the petitioner by providing him an opportunity of being heard and in absence of that, it cannot be assumed that the petitioner is guilty of producing forged document which can be basis for passing the order of termination. Finding the order of termination disproportionate to the attributed misconduct and the court said the same necessarily warrants the interference of the Court. Accordingly the bench allowed the petition and the impugned notice was quashed to the extent of petitioner No.1 only. The respondents were further directed to allow the petitioner to perform his duties as Nursing Assistant without any hindrance.  Case Title: Rokade Santosh Sandashiv & Anr Vs Union of India & Anr.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has held that Commercial matters involving Arbitration disputes can only be heard by Commercial Court of the status of District Judge or Additional District Judge. It held that a Civil Judge would not be the competent authority to entertain cases under Sections 9,14, 34 & 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. A Division Bench... The Madhya Pradesh High Court has held that Commercial matters involving Arbitration disputes can only be heard by Commercial Court of the status of District Judge or Additional District Judge.  It held that a Civil Judge would not be the competent authority to entertain cases under Sections 9,14, 34 & 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Vijay Kumar Shukla in its order dated February 26 held that the language employed in the definition clause of "Court" in Section 2(1)(c) of the Arbitration Act clearly indicates that the Legislature intended to confer power in respect of disputes involving arbitration on the highest judicial Court of the District.  This, the Court opined, was done to minimize the supervisory role of Courts in the arbitral process and, therefore, purposely excluded any Civil Court of a grade inferior to such Principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes.  Background  The Court was presiding over a writ petition filed by Advocate Yashwardhan Raghuwanshi, assailing the validity of an order dated 20th October, 2020 passed by the District and Sessions Judge, Bhopal, in exercise of powers conferred upon him by Section 15(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Courts Act, 1958 read with Sections 194, 381(1) & 400 of CrPC, distributing civil and criminal business amongst various Additional District Judges and Subordinate Judges working under his supervision.  The challenge in particular was made to Entry 45 of the aforesaid order vide which cases filed under the Arbitration Act involving commercial disputes under provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 of specified value between Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 1 crore were assigned to Civil Judge Class-I.  The controversy pertains to an apparent conflict between the Commercial Courts Act where Courts of Civil Judge are designated as Commercial Courts and the Arbitration Act where Courts of a grade inferior to Principal Civil Court have been barred from trying arbitration matters.  Arguments  It was the Petitioner's case that the Court of Civil Judge is not a competent authority to try arbitration disputes. He submitted:  Arbitration Act is a consolidated statute for law relating to any form of arbitration dispute, intended to streamline the commercial disputes arising out of arbitration in speedy manner, for which purpose the Special Courts have been set up.Any commercial dispute involving arbitration shall be tried only by Principal Civil Court of the superior most jurisdiction in the District i.e. the Court of District Judge or at the maximum, it could be assigned to the Court of Additional District Judge as per Section 7 read with Section 15 of the Civil Courts Act but it cannot be assigned to a Court inferior thereto.The term "Court" for the purpose of Arbitration Act has been defined under Section 2(1 )(c) of the Arbitration Act which provides that "Court" means, in cases of an arbitration other than international commercial arbitration, the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a grade inferior to such Principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes.A conjoint reading of the Arbitration Act and Commercial Courts Act, makes it clear that only such "commercial matters" which do not involve the arbitration matters can be assigned to a notified Commercial Court of the status of a Senior Civil Judge but all matters involving both Commercial Courts Act as well as Arbitration Act can only be tried by the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction.Section 11 of the Commercial Courts Act provides that a Commercial Court or a Commercial Division, shall not entertain or decide any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of Civil Court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force. The jurisdiction of Commercial Courts of the status of Senior Civil Judge to entertain any suit, application or proceeding pertaining to Arbitration Act involving commercial disputes is expressly barred.As per Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, an appeal against the order of Commercial Court (XX Civil Judge Class-I) shall lie to the Commercial Appellate Court (XIX Additional District Judge), and then it has further provided appeal to the High Court. On the other hand, the Arbitration Act provides for only one appeal to the High Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act against the order of the Principal Civil Court.When the "commercial arbitration matters" arc clubbed together, they create an ambiguity and conflict. It is however scuttled law that when there is conflict between two central enactments, the provision of special law should prevail over the general law. Thus, on applying the doctrine of harmonious construction on the provisions of both the statutes, it is clear that they are best harmonized by giving effect to the special statute i.e. the Arbitration Act vis-a-vis the more general statute i.e. the Commercial Courts Act.  Findings  Concurring with the submissions made by the Petitioner, the Division Bench held,  "It would be evident from the language employed by the Legislature in the definition clause of "Court" in Section 2(1)(c) of the Arbitration Act that it intended to confer power in respect of the disputes involving arbitration on the highest judicial Court of a District so as to minimize the supervisory role of the Courts in the arbitral process and, therefore, purposely excluded any Civil Court of grade inferior to such Principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes."  It added,  "Segregation of an arbitration matters on the basis of a pecuniary limit is not what the law provides for. All the arbitration matters, irrespective of the value of claim, arc required to be adjudicated by Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction."  It thus held that the impugned order, to the extent of classifying the commercial disputes having subject matter of arbitration on the basis of valuation and conferring powers therefor on the Court of XX Civil Judge Class-I, Bhopal, would be violative of relevant provisions of law.  The Bench relied on State of Maharashtra v. Atlanta Limited, (2014) 11 SCC 61, whereby the Supreme Court, in the context of two Courts having concurrent jurisdiction, held that appeal against the award in cases where the District Court as the Principal Civil Court exercises original jurisdiction under the Arbitration Act, would lie to the High Court.  Reference was also made to a judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Fun N. Fud v. GLK Associates, 2019 SCC Online Guj 4236.  In this case, the High Court was examining the validity of the order passed by the Additional District Judge declining to hear an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act on the ground that it has no jurisdiction to hear and entertain such application and, and directing the applicant therein to present his application before the Court of Principal Senior Civil Judge.  The High Court had held that in view of Section 11 of the Commercial Courts Act, which bars a Commercial Court from deciding any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force, the Commercial Court which is a Civil Court of a grade inferior to such Principal Civil Court, or any Court of small causes, would be barred from exercising jurisdiction under Section 9 or any provision of the Arbitration Act.

Whether the day of remand is to be included or excluded, for considering a claim for default bail ? The Supreme Court referred this issue to a larger bench.The Court was considering the appeal filed against the Bombay High Court judgment which held that the day of remand has to be included for the purpose of computing the period of 90 days or 60 days as contemplated in Section 167 (2)(a)(ii)... Whether the day of remand is to be included or excluded, for considering a claim for default bail ? The Supreme Court referred this issue to a larger bench. The Court was considering the appeal filed against the Bombay High Court judgment which held that the day of remand has to be included for the purpose of computing the period of 90 days or 60 days as contemplated in Section 167 (2)(a)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Bombay High Court had observed thus while granting  bail to DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhwan and Dheeraj Wadhwan in the Enforcement Directorate's case of money laundering registered against them as the agency failed to file a chargesheet within 60 days from the date of remand.  The bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy noticed that, in State of M.P. Vs. Rustom & Ors.1995 (Supp) 3 SCC 221 , Ravi Prakash Singh Vs. State of Bihar (2015) 8 SCC 340 and M. Ravindran Vs. Intelligence Officer, Director of Revenue Intelligence,  it was held that the date of remand is to be excluded for computing the permitted period for completion of investigation. On the other hand, the judgments in Chaganti Satyanarayan Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh (1986) 3 SCC 141 , CBI Vs. Anupam J Kulkarni (1992) 3 SCC 141 , State Vs. Mohd. Ashraft Bhat (1996) 1 SCC 432 , State of Maharashtra Vs. Bharati Chandmal Varma (2002) 2 SCC 121, and Pragyna Singh Thakur Vs. State of Maharashtra (2011) 10 SCC 445, have held that the date of remand must be included for computing the available period for investigation for determining entitlement to default bail. It noticed that the ratio in Chaganti and also in Mhd. Ashraft Bhat  was not brought to the notice of the 3 judges bench in M Ravindran and the Court took a contrary view in declaring that the date of remand is to be excluded for computing the period of investigation, to facilitate the claim of default bail by an accused. "Since the earlier position of law was not considered and the latest decision is of a 3 judges bench, it is necessary for a bench of appropriate strength to settle the law taking note of the earlier precedents. Unless the issue is appropriately determined, the courts across the country may take decision on the issue depending upon which judgment is brought to the Court's notice or on the Courts own understanding of the law, covering default bail under Section 167 (2)(a) II of CrPC", the bench observed. The bench therefore directed the Registry to place all the relevant documents before the Chief Justice for constituting a bench of at least 3 judges to resolve the conflict in law. "We feel it appropriate to refer the above-mentioned issue to a larger Bench of this Court for an authoritative pronouncement to quell this conflict of views as the same shall enable the Courts to apply the law uniformly.", it added. CASE: ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE vs. KAPIL WADHAWAN [CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 701-702 OF 2020]CORAM: Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh RoyCITATION: LL 2021 SC 118     
The Allahabad High Court on Monday directed the private schools to adjust/pay back the excess money (15% of the total fee) that was charged from students during the COVID Pandemic period (2020-21 session).  The bench of Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice J. J. Munir ordered thus while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by aggrieved parents from all over the State seeking regulation of fees in all government and private schools in Uttar Pradesh.  The grievance raised by the petitioners was that certain facilities were not provided during the COVID-19 pandemic hence they are not liable to pay for that.   Appearing for the petitioners, Advocates Shashwat Anand and Yanendra Pandey argued that fees is a matter of quid pro quo and during the 2020-21 session, no services, except online tuition, were provided in private schools.  Hence, it was submitted that charging even a single rupee over and above the tuition fee by private schools was nothing but profiteering and commercialization of education.   In support of their contentions, the counsels had cited the 2021 judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Indian School, Jodhpur Vs. State Of Rajasthan LL 2021 SC 240 wherein it was held that private schools demanding fees without providing any services amounts to profiteering and commercialization of education.  In fact, in this very case, the Top Court had, instead of relegating the parties to any regulatory authority to refix the school fee for the academic year 2020-21, balanced the equities by issuing a one-time direction for the academic year 2020-21 that the fee payable by the students shall be 15% less than what was paid for the academic year 2019-20.   The court had also ordered that if any excess had been paid, the same would have to be adjusted in the fee to be paid in future.  Taking note of the Apex Court’s judgment and referring to the directions issued therein, the High Court, in its order, directed the private school that in case any fee has been paid in excess of what has been determined by the Supreme Court in the Indian School case (supra) judgment, in the case of the students still studying, the same may be adjusted in the fee to be paid in future.   In the case of students who have passed out or left the school, the Court has ordered that the amount may be calculated and returned to those students. As per the court’s order, this exercise has to be done within two months.  In other words, as per the order of the High Court, all the schools will have to calculate 15% of the total fees charged during the year 2020-21 and adjust the same in the academic next session.   As far as the students who have left the schools are concerned, 15% of the said fees will have to be refunded to them.

If the role attributed to the accused in an offence is prima facie less serious than the role attributed to the co-accused who have been granted the benefit of bail under S.438 CrPC and under S.439 CrPC, and if the accused is a first-time offender, then he deserves an opportunity to course-correct and the opportunity of bail cannot be denied to him. A single-judge bench of... If the role attributed to the accused in an offence is prima facie less serious than the role attributed to the co-accused who have been granted the benefit of bail under S.438 CrPC and under S.439 CrPC, and if the accused is a first-time offender, then he deserves an opportunity to course-correct and the opportunity of bail cannot be denied to him.  A single-judge bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court presided over by Justice Anoop Chitkara has recently observed that if the accused is a first-time offender and if his co-accused who were similarly placed, have been granted bail, even though the role of co-accused in the offence was more serious than that of the accused, then accused's bail application should be accepted and the accused should be given a chance for grant of bail.  The facts of the case involve an accused from Sonipat who had been charged under Sections 148 (Rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of the offence committed in prosecution of a common object), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon), 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) under the FIR.  He had approached the High Court seeking bail under S.439 (Special Powers of High Court or Court of Sessions regarding Bail) of CrPC.  While the counsel for the petitioner, Advocate Vikas Gulia argued that custodial investigation would serve no purpose and surmised that pre-trial incarceration would cause injustice to the petitioner and his family, the DAG representing State contended that since the challan has been presented and charges have been framed, accused should not be granted bail.  The Court concluded that the possibility of the accused to influence the investigation or to tamper with evidence or to intimidate the witnesses and subsequent thwarting of justice could be taken care of by imposing stringent and elaborate conditions. It relied on judgment in Gurbaksh Singh v. the State of Punjab which held that the bail decision must enter cumulative effect of the variety of circumstances justifying the grant/refusal of bail. Reference was also made to Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan where a three-judge bench of Supreme Court held that if the prosecution fails to establish a prima facie case against the accused, then even persons accused in non-bailable offences are entitled to bail.  The Court further recalled the norm of bail, not jail; except where circumstances suggest thwarting the course of justice.  And thus, without commenting on the merits of the case, the Court granted the petitioner bail subject to him joining the investigation and fully cooperating with investigating agencies and following the below-mentioned conditions   That he shall furnish a personal bond of INR 10000That he shall furnish one surety of INR 25000 to the satisfaction of concerned court/judicial magistrate having jurisdiction That he shall execute a bond for attendance in the concerned court, as and when asked toThat he shall not influence, browbeat, pressurize, threaten or promise directly or indirectly to witnesses, police officials or any other person acquainted with facts of the case to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the police/court or to tamper with evidence. That till the completion of the trial, the petition shall not contact, call, text, message, remark, stare, stalk, make any gestures or express any unusual or inappropriate, verbal or otherwise objectionable behaviour towards the victim and victim's family, either physically or through a phone call or any other social media, through any other mode, nor shall he unnecessarily roam around the victim's home. That the petitioner shall surrender all weapons, firearms, ammunition along with arms license to the concerned authority within 30 days from his release from prison and inform the investigator about such compliance.

The Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the murder of local All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Bhadu Sheikh that was followed by arson in Bogtui village, Rampurhat, Birbhum, that killed eight people, including two children.The Court had earlier transferred to the CBI the investigation into the incident of violence in... The Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the murder of local All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Bhadu Sheikh that was followed by arson in Bogtui village, Rampurhat, Birbhum, that killed eight people, including two children. The Court had earlier transferred to the CBI the investigation into the incident of violence in Birbhum district of West Bengal that had allegedly taken place in retaliation to the murder of Sheikh. The Court on Thursday had  reserved its order in a batch of pleas seeking a CBI probe into the murder of TMC leader Bhadu Sheikh.  A Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj on Thursday had taken on record the preliminary report submitted by the CBI as per the Court's earlier directions.  Pursuant to the perusal of the report, the Court observed that the report prima facie suggests that the brutal incident of burning and killing at Bogtui village is the direct fall out of the murder of Bhadu Sheikh at 8.30 P.M. on the same day. It was further noted that the CBI report suggests that the incident is the outcome political rivalry amongst members of two groups in the village and that the burning of houses resulting in the death of 8 persons was a retaliatory plan. A host of applications had been moved before the Bench on Thursday seeking for a CBI probe into the murder of local TMC leader Bhadu Sheikh. The concerned counsels had alleged that the unfortunate incident of setting 10 houses on fire is not an isolated incident rather it is a counter-blast of the murder of Sheikh.  Opining that there is a 'close relationship and linkage' between the two incidents, the Court observed,  "Both the incidents took place within a gap of about 2 hours. Material placed on record prima facie suggests close relationship and linkage between the two incidents. The incidents are alleged to be result of political rivalry. The allegation of the applicants that both incidents form part of the common conspiracy and continuous cause of action cannot be ignored." The Bench further opined that if one agency investigates both the incidents then not only it will be easier to unearth the truth but it will also facilitate the trial before the same competent Court. Ordering a CBI probe into the murder, the Court underscored,  "The object of issuing the necessary direction in the suo motu petition is to ensure appropriate action against the person responsible for the incident. On the basis of the material which is available before us, we are of the opinion that the said object can be more appropriately achieved if the incident of murder of Bhadu Sk is also investigated by the CBI along with the incident of burning of houses and murder of villagers of Bogtui which took place shortly thereafter. The second incident prima facie seems to be the fall out of first incident" Accordingly, the Court directed the State police authorities to immediately hand over the investigation in the case of murder of Sheikh to the CBI along with all the records pertaining to the investigation conducted till date.  "The CBI is directed to investigate the murder case of Bhadu Sk along with the investigation in the case of Bogtui house burning and murder case", the Court ordered further.  The CBI was ordered to submit a further status report pertaining to both the investigations on the next date of hearing which is slated to take place on May 2.  Additional Solicitor General Y.J Dastoor appearing for the CBI had submitted that the CBI is willing to investigate the murder of Bhadu Sheikh but he however expressed concerns that vital evidence may have been destroyed by now due to such a delayed plea for a CBI probe. He however had however contended that it is better if the investigation is done in both the cases by the same agency as both the incidents are interlinked and that it would facilitate trial of the cases before the same Judge. Advocate General S.N Mookherjee appearing for the State government had however, argued that the police were investigating the matter. Three out of the four petitions also did not seek an inquiry by the central agency, the State had submitted. He had further argued that that there is no allegation that the probe into the murder of Sheikh was not being conducted properly.  It may be noted the Court had earlier observed that although the SIT had been constituted on March 22, there had been no effective contribution of the SIT in the investigation. The Court had noted that despite the fact that the police station was situated very close to the place of occurrence, the police had not reached the crime scene on time as a result of which the persons trapped inside the houses were kept on burning.  The State constituted Special Investigating Team (SIT) had also been ordered to not carry out any further investigation into the incident of violence.  The Court had earlier initiated a suo motu case to consider the issue. Background The violence in Birbhum's Bogtui village took place following the alleged murder of Bhadu Sheikh, a panchayat leader of the ruling Trinamool Congress. He died after miscreants allegedly hurled bombs at him on March 21. Hours later, violence erupted and several houses, including two belonging to the men accused of Sheikh's murder, were allegedly attacked and set on fire resulting in eight deaths, including that of women and children. The police recovered eight charred bodies, primarily of women and children from the gutted houses in Bogtui village. Three victims were admitted to the local hospital. The death toll currently stands at nine. Taking cognisance of the violence, the State government had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by the additional director general of police (CID), Gyanwant Singh, to probe the incident. However, subsequently, the investigation was handed over to the CBI pursuant to the directions of the Calcutta High Court. As part of its investigation, the CBI has reportedly moved a local court on Wednesday to seek permission for conducting polygraph tests on eight people arrested in the case, including TMC leader Anarul Hossain. According to reports, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday gave government jobs to 10 people who were affected in the Birbhum violence. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has also taken suo motu cognizance of the matter and issued notices to the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police, West Bengal calling for a detailed report in the matter within 4 weeks including the status for the FIRs registered in the matter, steps taken to ensure safety of the people in the village and any relief or rehabilitation provided by the State Government.

The Supreme Court observed that there can be a conviction solely based upon the dying declaration without corroboration."If the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and voluntary it can base its conviction on it, without corroboration", the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed.The court observed thus while restoring the conviction of the murder... The Supreme Court observed that there can be a conviction solely based upon the dying declaration without corroboration. "If the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and voluntary it can base its conviction on it, without corroboration", the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna observed. The court observed thus while restoring the conviction of the murder accused recorded by the Trial Court.  In this case, the Trial Court, to convict the accused relied on the dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate and also held that the defence put forth on behalf of the accused that the deceased herself poured the kerosene on her is not believable considering the medical evidence on record. The High Court, refusing to rely on the dying declaration, acquitted the accused. In appeal, the Apex Court noted that there are two dying declarations, one recorded by the Police Officer on 20.12.2011 and another recorded by the Magistrate/SDM recorded on 22.12.2011. The bench noted that the High Court has not believed the dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate/SDM on 22.12.2011 mainly on the ground that when the dying declaration was already recorded by the Police Officer on 20.12.2011, there was no reason to record the second dying declaration. "However, it is required to be noted that what was recorded by the Police Officer on 20.12.2011 was the statement under Section 161 Cr.PC. Therefore, it was thought fit to record the dying declaration of the deceased by the Magistrate and that is why SDM was called to record the dying declaration of deceased on 22.12.2011", the court noted. The court further noticed that in the statement of dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate, the accused are specifically named and it is specifically stated that they poured kerosene on her. "Nothing is on record with regard to any allegation against the Magistrate/SDM to the effect that he was biased or interested in recording the dying declaration against the accused. He was summoned during the course of investigation and during the course of investigation he recorded the dying declaration and the statement of deceased. Even the High Court as such has not doubted the credibility of the dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate/SDM on the ground of malice. The reasoning given by the High Court to not rely upon the dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate/SDM is not germane and cannot be accepted. We see no reason to doubt the dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate on 22.12.2011 in which the deceased specifically stated that at 11:00 am due to the feud over demanding money, respondents – accused have burned her after pouring kerosene over her. ", the court said. The bench then considered the question whether in absence of any corroborative evidence, there can be a conviction relying upon the dying declaration only ? Referring to Paniben (Smt) V. State of Gujarat, (1992) 2 SCC 474. the bench observed: "In the aforesaid decisions, it is specifically observed and held that there is neither a rule of law nor of prudence to the effect that a dying declaration cannot be acted upon without a corroboration. It is observed and held that if the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and voluntary it can base its conviction on it, without corroboration." The court noted that in Kushal Rao V. State of Bombay, AIR 1958 SC 22:1958 SCR 552, the Supreme Court has laid down the following principles as to the circumstances under which a dying declaration may be accepted, without corroboration: (1) that it cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law that a dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated;  (2) that each case must be determined on its own facts keeping in view  the circumstances in which the dying declaration was made;  (3) that it cannot be laid down as a general proposition that a dying declaration is a weaker kind of evidence than other pieces of evidence;  (4) that a dying declaration stands on the same footing as another piece of evidence and has to be judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and with reference to the principles governing the weighing of evidence;  (5) that a dying declaration which has been recorded by a competent Magistrate in the proper manner, that is to say, in the form of questions and answers, and, as far as practicable, in the words of the maker of the declaration, stands on a much higher footing than a dying declaration which depends upon oral testimony which may suffer from all the infirmities of human memory and human character, and  (6) that in order to test the reliability of a dying declaration, the court has to keep in view, the circumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for observation, for example, whether there was sufficient light if the crime was committed at night; whether the capacity of the man to remember the facts stated, had not been impaired at the time he was making the statement, by circumstances beyond his control; that the statement has been consistent throughout if he had several opportunities of making a dying declaration apart from the official record of it; and that the statement had been made at the earliest opportunity and was not the result of tutoring by interested parties. The court noted that, even in the statement recorded under section 161 of the Cr.PC, the deceased has stated that her father in­ law had attacked her with a stick with an intention to kill her and as a result, she locked herself in the room and set herself ablaze. The statements made by the deceased in her dying declaration are consistent with medical evidence which reveals that there were burns on all parts of the body except chest and sides of the abdomen and back, the bench observed while allowing appeal. Therefore, the accused were held guilty for the offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs.10,000/­ each.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday slammed the Haryana government for paying no heed to the Limitation Act and causing inordinate delays in preferring appeals. A single bench of Justice Deepak Gupta, while refusing to excuse the government on the ground that the case file was lost during interdepartmental consultation, remarked, "In large number of cases, the Government seeks to condone the delay on the similar grounds. Despite repeated directions given by this Court as well as by the Hon'ble Apex Court in plethora of authorities, there appears to be no change in the attitude of the State Government. The appeals are filed with impunity by the Government with huge delays and delay is sought to be condoned by assuming as if there is no statute like Limitation Act or under the assumption that application for whatever delay, will be condoned by the Court." The bench continued that even when the case file was said to have been lost by a particular official, no action was taken against him. Therefore it said that simply by stating that file moved from one office to another for seeking opinion and then was lost by one of the official, the State cannot be allowed to file an appeal with delay of more than 3 years, without bringing on record any fact as to the action taken against the erring officers/officials. "Rarely any action is taken against erring officials/public servants for their inaction of not taking the decision well within time resulting in huge delays. This practice must be put to stop." The Court was hearing a revision petition against the order of Additional District Judge who had condoned a delay of 1066 days at the behest of the State in preferring appeal against grant of decree of mandatory and perpetual injunction in favour of the petitioner herein. The suit was decreed by the Trial Court in 2014. The State of Haryana filed an appeal in December 2017. The petitioner contended that this was nothing but a measure to harass him.  The case of the State was that the delay was not intentional as case file was sent for recommendation to the Legal Remembrancer to the Government of Haryana, who agreed with the opinion of the District Attorney and directed the State to file the appeal. The letter was marked to the concerned official, who did not prepare the necessary papers regarding filing of the appeal and rather, he lost the file – causing the delay of 1066 days.  The High Court, while allowing the revision petition, said that:  "Appellants have been grossly negligent in filing the appeal before first appellate court, as inaction on their part for long time has resulted into delay of three years.  Case Title: Rohitash Yadav v. State of Haryana and Others  Coram: Justice Deepak Gupta       
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that merely because an FIR/charge-sheet incorporates the provision of Section 307 IPC, it would not by itself be a ground to reject the petition under Section 482 of the Code and refuse to accept the settlement between the parties.  Justice M A Chowdhary observed that while taking a call as to whether compromise in such cases should be effected or not the Court should go by the nature of injury sustained, the portion of the bodies where the injuries were inflicted (namely whether injuries are caused at the vital/delicate parts of the body) and the nature of weapons used etc. On that basis, if it is found that there is a strong possibility of proving the charge under Section 307 IPC, once the evidence to that effect is led and injuries proved, the Court should not accept settlement between the parties, the bench underscored. The bench further expounded that though accusation of offence under Section 307 IPC is a serious offence as the accused person(s) attempted to take the life of another person/victim, at the same time the court cannot be oblivious to hard realities that many times whenever there is a quarrel between the parties leading to physical commotion and sustaining of injury by either or both the parties, there is a tendency to give it a slant of an offence under Section 307 IPC as well. The remarks were made while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner challenged two cross FIRs for alleged commission of offences punishable under Sections 452, 392, 506, 323, 447, 307.  The parties earlier filed petitions against each other seeking quashment of the aforesaid impugned FIRs. However, during the pendency of the petitions the parties entered into compromise after which they unanimously decided to put the entire controversy to rest.  Counsel for the petitioner while relying on the Supreme Court judgement in Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab & Anr. reported as (2012) prayed that the Court should invoke its powers under Section 482 and accordingly quash the FIR keeping in view the compromise arrived between the parties.  Contesting the plea, the respondent-UT administration argued that since the petitioners are accused of offence under Section 307 IPC and therefore ordinarily should not be quashed by the High Court while exercising its powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C on the ground that the parties have settled their disputes.  On perusal of FIR, Justice Chowdhary observed that the complainant had alleged that he was assaulted ruthlessly by the accused, however, he was saved by his employees and he did not state anything about any injury on his person. There was also delay of about two weeks in lodging FIR and the offences punishable under Sections 307, 506, 427, 34 IPC were added later, the court noted.  "It appears that the complainant had not received any injury on any vital part of his body so as to constitute attempt to murder punishable under Section 307 IPC, otherwise he could have mentioned this fact, in his statement given to the police at the time of lodging of FIR, that too after two weeks of the alleged occurrence. In such a situation there cannot be any chance of conviction under Section 307 IPC, even after trial before the court", said the court.  "Admitted position of the case is that both the parties have amicably settled the disputes between themselves and buried the hatchet" said the court adding" In such a scenario, this Court is under obligation to give its imprimatur to such a settlement".  Accordingly the bench allowed the petition and quashed the FIR's and the consequent proceedings emanating from them.   Case Title : Sheikh Feroz Ahmad Vs UT of J&K       
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Thursday ruled that retrospective operation of a Government Order cannot be permitted particularly where it is merely an executive order, and not a legislation.  A bench comprising Justice Waseem Sadiq Nargal observed,  "As every Government/executive order by virtue of a policy has prospective operation, it can in no way be applied retrospectively by infusing life in a Government order and interpreting differently, when the explicit language leads to an irresistible conclusion".  The observations were made while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged recommendations issued by the J&K Power Development Department dated 28.12.2015, whereby the earlier recommendations of the then Designate Committee for Power granting permission to change arc furnace with induction furnace at his industrial unit had been unilaterally withdrawn.  The specific case of the petitioner was that his Company was running a Casting Unit at Jammu and had been sanctioned power load of 2250 KVA for manufacturing of Ferro Alloys vide Government Order dated 18.10.1995.  However, from the year 2007-08, the working of the unit became erratic due to non availability of chromite ore from the State of Orissa, as a result of which the petitioner approached the Power Development Department seeking requisite permission for replacing the existing arc furnace with induction furnace.  Nevertheless, in the year 2010 Power Development Department issued order dated 03.03.2010, by virtue of which, it was ordered that henceforth no power connection be provided to industrial units engaged in Iron and Steel Manufacturing through the use of electric induction and arc furnaces. By virtue of the aforesaid order, a complete ban was imposed on power connections for electric induction and arc furnace by the industrial units.  In his plea counsel for the petitioner Sr Adv Pranav Kohli argued that the aforesaid Government Order whereby the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir had imposed ban on power connections cannot be made applicable to the case of the petitioner, inasmuch as, it was not the case of the petitioner for providing fresh power connection to the petitioner unit.  The petitioner had sought permission from the concerned dept to replace the Arc furnace with induction furnace which came to be granted by the Chief Engineer on 22.03.2012. Subsequently this permission was withdrawn. Throwing a challenge to the withdrawal of this permission, counsel contended that the respondent has taken the case of change from arc to induction furnace as a case of new power connection when the fact of the matter was that the Chief Engineer has only granted permission of change of machinery and the order of withdrawal of the said permission is liable to be quashed.  Counsel for the petitioner also placed on record a latest order issued by Government dated 20.05.2022 by virtue of which, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir lifted the ban on Electric Arc and Induction Furnaces in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir on which he argued that the ban was lifted only vis-a-vis the new connections and that his case does not fall within the ambit of new connection.  Adjudicating upon the matter Justice Nargal observed that though the order which granted power connection to the petitioner was issued way back in 1995 for running the arc furnace but once a subsequent Government order specifically provides that it is in supersession of all the previous circulars/orders, then the connection which was granted earlier loses its significance and the subsequent ban comes into force, which covers both the cases for the use of electric induction furnace and arc furnace.  "Once ban has been imposed, then it covers both the cases i.e. no power connection shall be provided to the industrial unit engaged in the iron and steel manufacturing through the use of electric induction and arc furnace or even shifting from arc furnace to electric induction furnace, which also tantamounts to granting new power connection, which was banned. Shifting also falls within the ambit of granting new connections, which was prohibited by the said order imposing ban", the bench underscored.  Deliberating on the subject of removal of ban in 2022 and the contention of the petitioner that that the ban was lifted only vis-a-vis the new connections and that his case does not fall within the ambit of new connection, the bench observed that the interpretation drawn by the counsel for the petitioner cannot sustain the test of law and is liable to be rejected on the ground that if the interpretation as projected by the petitioner is taken to be true then, it will tantamount to draw a different interpretation than what was the import of the Government order and in a way, it would tantamount to interpret a Government order imposing ban retrospectively for 12 years in a different way.  Expounding law on the limitations on the retrospective application of executive orders Justice Nargal observed, that the retrospective operation of a Government Order cannot be permitted particularly where it is merely an executive order, and not a legislation, further adding that petitioner has not called in question the order dated 03.03.2010 (supra) for more than 12 twelve years and accepted the same gladly and voluntarily and hence is estopped under law to question the same at such belated stage.  Accordingly the bench found the petition devoid of any merit and dismissed the same.  Case Title : M/s Shree Guru Kripa Alloys Pvt. Ltd.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Gwalior Bench) on Monday directed the Principal Secretary, Law and Legislative Affairs/District Magistrate, Bhind to conduct an inquiry against a Public Prosecutor who gave up an 'important' eye witness/father of the deceased in a murder trial.The Bench of Justice G. S. Ahluwalia has also directed the Public Prosecutor, Bhind to withdraw all the Sessions... The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Gwalior Bench) on Monday directed the Principal Secretary, Law and Legislative Affairs/District Magistrate, Bhind to conduct an inquiry against a Public Prosecutor who gave up an 'important' eye witness/father of the deceased in a murder trial. The Bench of Justice G. S. Ahluwalia has also directed the Public Prosecutor, Bhind to withdraw all the Sessions Trial involving offence under Sections 302, 307, 376/POCSO Act and all other important matters from the said Public Prosecutor Till the inquiry report is received. This order came from the Court while hearing a regular bail plea filed by a Murder accused on the ground that since four eyewitnesses have been examined and they have not supported the prosecution case, he shall be released on bail. The matter in brief  Essentially, on October 5, 2021, the Co-ordinate Bench had expressed its surprise to note that the trial court had, in the instant case, given up two eyewitnesses namely Hariom and Sarnam Singh (father of the deceased who is an eye witness) on the request of Public Prosecutor. Accordingly, the Public Prosecutor, named Sanjay Kumar Sharma was directed to submit his affidavit for explaining the reason for giving up the said eyewitnesses. In his affidavit, he submitted that since Sarnam Singh (father of the deceased who is an eye witness) and Hariom were not supporting the prosecution case, therefore, in order to save precious time of the Court, these two witnesses were given up. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court observed that it was nowhere mentioned in the affidavit that Hariom and Sarnam Singh had ever contacted him (Sanjay Kumar Sharma) to inform that they would not support the prosecution case. Apart from this, the Court also observed that another witness had not supported the prosecution case, but the same witness was not given up by the Public Prosecutor by applying the same analogy "How Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma was knowing that these witnesses (Hariom and Sarnam Singh) would not support the prosecution case is also a mystery," the Court further observed. In this backdrop, the Court remarked thus: "It is clear that Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma has arbitrarily given up Sarnam Singh who is the father of the deceased and an eye witness as well as Hariom. However, this Court is refraining itself from mentioning anything further but one thing is clear that Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma has lost the confidence." Accordingly, the Court directed as under:- The Public Prosecutor, Bhind shall immediately withdraw file of this case from Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma and Public Prosecutor shall himself conduct trial and Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma is directed to stay away from this case. The Principal Secretary, Law and Legislative Affairs/District Magistrate, Bhind (whosoever is the competent authority) is directed to conduct an enquiry against Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma and decide as to whether his continuation on the post of APP is desirable or not (within 2 months). The Public Prosecutor shall immediately file an application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C for seeking permission to examine Hariom and Sarnam Singh. Since this Court has already come to a conclusion that Shri Sanjay Kumar Sharma APP has wrongly given up these witnesses, therefore, the trial Court shall consider and decide the same after considering the importance of the witnesses. So far as the present bail application was concerned, noting the allegations that the applicant and his son Ashok had fired causing the death of the deceased, Sarnam Singh (an eye witness), the Court dismissed his bail plea.

The Bombay High Court has read down rule for Maharashtra quota reservation with respect to admission in 5-year law program in the State for candidates who are born/ domiciled in Maharashtra but who could not complete their 10th/ 12th from the State on account of their parent's army posting."Rules are not ultra vires, however, we may hasten to add that same needs to be read down to... The Bombay High Court has read down rule for Maharashtra quota reservation with respect to admission in 5-year law program in the State for candidates who are born/ domiciled in Maharashtra but who could not complete their 10th/ 12th from the State on account of their parent's army posting. "Rules are not ultra vires, however, we may hasten to add that same needs to be read down to provide relaxation or exemption for those candidates who are born in Maharashtra and whose parents are domicile of Maharashtra but due to fortuitous circumstances such as the parent is in service of the Government and serving the nation and due to service condition is deployed in various parts of the country could not complete their SSC or HSC from State of Maharashtra", the court held. Justices S.V. Gangapurwala and Madhav J. Jamdar were dealing with a writ petition challenging the eligibility criteria for availing admission through Maharashtra quota in 5-year integrated law course. The petitioners are wards of an Army Officer. Petitioners were born in Maharashtra; however, they completed their 10th and 12th standard from Army School in New Delhi. They couldn't study in Maharashtra as their father was posted at various locations outside Maharashtra.  The state government notified MH-CET Examination for 5 years integrated LLB course. The notification provides for 85% reservation for candidates who, inter alia, pass Class 10th and 12th or equivalent exams from a recognized institution in Maharashtra. The petitioner have challenged this eligibility criteria before the High Court. Dr. Abhinav Chandrachud for the Petitioners submitted that it is arbitrary and unreasonable that the Petitioners are deprived of equal opportunity of education in their parent State only on account of their father being posted at various locations throughout the country. State has created an unjustified classification violating Article 14 of the Constitution. Petitioners had to take 10th and 12th standard from outside Maharashtra due to fortuitous circumstances. Advocate Sameer Khedekar for the State Common Entrance Test Cell submitted that the Rule is not discriminatory or arbitrary. Preference based on domicile or institution is allowed within reasonable limits i.e., it does not result in reservation of more than 85% seats in graduate courses and more than 75% seats in post graduate courses. The court perused the Rules of admission and concluded that the primary criteria for candidature under Maharashtra State quota is that the candidate should have passed 10th and 12th standard examination from the institution located within Maharashtra. The court stated that the condition of passing 10th and 12th standard from Maharashtra may not be unreasonable or arbitrary, however, further distinction will have to be made as there may be cases where the candidate does not have a choice, such as the service conditions of the parents due to which they are posted throughout the country in the service of the nation.  "In such cases, relaxation can be provided by the State Government to such candidates of not completing SSC and HSC from the State of Maharashtra. If such exception or relaxation is not provided, the same would be harsh and would be disentitling the candidates domiciled in Maharashtra or born in Maharashtra from taking benefit of Maharashtra State quota", the court observed. The court noted that an exception is provided to students who are not domiciled in Maharashtra but have completed 10th and 12th from Maharashtra and their parents have been transferred to the state by Government of India just before last date on submitting the form. However, students who are domiciled in Maharashtra but didn't complete class 10th and 12th in Maharashtra due to parents posted elsewhere by the Government of India are precluded from availing the Maharashtra State quota. "The same would be unreasonable", the court held.  Case no. – Writ Petition No. 8539 of 2022 Case title – Priya Kedar Gokhale and Anr. v. State of Maharashtra and Ors. Coram – Justice S.V.

The Madras High Court has directed the State Judicial Academy to impart training to the stakeholders dealing with the cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act including the investigating officer, public prosecutor and Special Judge.  A single judge bench comprising of Justice P Velmurugan was dealing with a criminal appeal filed challenging a conviction order dated 25th November 2019 by Special POCSO Judge under sec. 4 of the POCSO Act.  "Hence, the State Judicial Academy is directed to impart training to the stake holders, dealing with the cases under POCSO Act, including the Investigating Officer, the Public Prosecutor and the Special Judge, who is dealing with the cases under the POCSO Act, after obtaining necessary permission from My Lord the Honourable Chief." The Court directed.  The Special Judge had sentenced the accused to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years with Rs. 15,000 fine and also directed the Taluk Legal Services Authority to pay compensation to the victim child of not less than Rs. 4 lakhs.  It was thus the case of the appellant that the victim girl had not made any allegations against him nor did she lodge any complaint against him and the victim has improved her version stage by stage.  It was also submitted that in her sec. 164 CrPC statement before the Magistrate, the victim had stated that the accused had had sexual intercourse with her only three times however the version was changed before the doctor at the time of medical examination by saying that the intercourse happened several times.  It was also argued that the trial court had failed to consider the discrepancies in prosecution's case and erroneously convicted the appellant based on the contradictory evidence of the victim girl.  On the other hand, it was submitted on behalf of the prosecution that the victim aged 16 years had clearly spoken about the offence committed by the accused which clearly attracts offence under the POCSO Act.  Hearing the submissions and the facts of the case at hand, the Court observed that cases of this nature under the POCSO Act, the Court cannot expect independent witness and the evidence of the victim itself would suffice to convict the accused, when it is trustworthy.  "The victim, who is aged about 16 years at the time of occurrence, has clearly narrated the incident and the involvement of the accused in the offence, which would clearly attract offence under the POCSO Act. In the case on hand, there is no reason to discard the evidence of the victim." The Court said.  Furthermore, the Court observed thus:  "Age of the victim child being 16 years, her capacity of understanding cannot be on par with an adult, who has completed 18 years. Even otherwise, if she has given consent for sexual intercourse, her consent is immaterial as she was a child under the definition of Section 2(1) of the POCSO Act. Hence the offence committed by the appellant would come under the definition of aggravated penetrative sexual assault under Section 5(l) punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. But, neither, the prosecution nor the Special Judge framed charges under Section 5(l) of the POCSO Act."  Furthermore, dismissing the criminal appeal, the Court ordered thus:  "The trial Court has already directed the Taluk Legal Services Authority to pay compensation to the victim not less than Rs.4.00 Lakhs under Victim Compensation Scheme and this Court, in the interest of justice, enhancing the amount to Rs.5.00 Lakhs and the appellant is also directed to pay a compensation of Rs.5.00 Lakhs to the victim girl immediately."

The Supreme Court observed that the time period for investigation specified under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be extended by seeking to file supplementary charge sheet qua UAPA offences.The bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R. Subhash Reddy, while granting default bail to Fakhrey Alam, a person accused under Section 18 of the UAPA Act, reiterated... The Supreme Court observed that the time period for investigation specified under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be extended by seeking to file supplementary charge sheet qua UAPA offences. The bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R. Subhash Reddy, while granting default bail to Fakhrey Alam, a person accused under Section 18 of the UAPA Act, reiterated that default bail under first proviso of Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. is a fundamental right and not merely a statutory right. The court noted that in this case, even within the 180 days period, the charge sheet/supplementary charge sheet under the UAPA Act was not filed and it was after a lapse of 211 days that this charge sheet had been filed. "We do not think that the State can take advantage of the fact that in one case there is one charge sheet and supplementary charge sheets are used to extend the time period in this manner by seeking to file the supplementary charge sheet qua the offences under the UAPA Act even beyond the period specified under Section 167 of the Cr.P.C beyond which default bail will be admissible, i.e., the period of 180 days. That period having expired and the charge sheet not having been filed qua those offences (albeit a supplementary charge sheet), we are of the view the appellant would be entitled to default bail in the aforesaid facts and circumstances.", the court said. The court added that since the consequences of the UAPA Act are drastic in punishment and in that context, default bail is held not to be a mere statutory right but part of the procedure established by law under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. "We cannot lose sight of the fact that what was envisaged by the Legislature was that the investigation should be completed in 24 hours but practically that was never found feasible. It is in these circumstances that Section 167 of the Cr.P.C. provided for time period within which the investigation should be completed, depending upon the nature of offences. Since, liberty is a Constitutional right, time periods were specified in the default of which the accused will have a right to default bail, a valuable right, the court added. Referring to  Bikramjit Singh vs. State of Punjab (2020) 10 SCC 616, the court observed: "We need only emphasize what is already observed in Bikramjit Singh case (supra) that default bail under first proviso of Section 167(2) of the Cr.P.C. is a fundamental right and not merely a statutory right as it is, a procedure established by law under Article 21 of the Constitution. Thus a fundamental right is granted to an accused person to be released on bail once the conditions of the first proviso to Section 167(2)of the Cr.P.C. are fulfilled. In fact in the majority judgment of this Court it has been held that an oral application for grant of default bail would suffice. " Yet another contention raised by the accused in this case was that the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow could not have granted 180 days for filing of the charge sheet as the jurisdiction in respect of offences under the UAPA Act, which cases are entrusted to NIA, vests only with the special courts and this aspect was no more res integra in view of judgment of this Court in the case of Bikramjit Singh vs. State of Punjab. The state, contended that the judgment in Bikramjit Singh's case (supra) was in the given situation prevalent in the State of Punjab, but on the other hand in State of Uttar Pradesh the competent Court was of the special Chief Judicial Magistrate and it is only recently now about a month back that special Courts had been notified. The court, agreed with the state's contention on this aspect and observed that the situation in the State of Uttar Pradesh is different and it is not as if there were any notified special courts in existence.

The Allahabad High Court last week observed that a Criminal Appeal cannot be dismissed on the ground of not being pressed.  The Bench of Justice Anil Kumar Ojha observed thus while allowing a revision plea filed against an order passed by Additional Sessions Judge under Section 101 of JJ Act dismissing an appeal filed by the accused/revisionist on the ground of not pressed. The case in brief  Essentially, the Accused/Revisionists were convicted by the Juvenile Justice Board, District Sambhal under Sections 376, 506 I.P.C. in December 2020. Challenging the said order and judgment, they had moved an appeal before the Court of passed by Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi. However, the appellate court dismissed their appeal in November 2021 as not pressed and affirmed the order and judgment of the Juvenile Justice Board, District Sambhal convicting them under Sections 376, 506 I.P.C. Thereafter, the Revisionists moved the High Court with their instant revision plea.  Before the High Court, their counsel argued that the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi was illegal as the appeal had been dismissed on the ground of not pressed by the counsel for the Revisionists. Court's observations Referring to the apex court's ruling in the cases of State of Haryana v. Janak Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 431 and Gurjant Singh vs State of Punjab LL 2021 SC 650, the High Court came to the conclusion that a Criminal Appeal cannot be dismissed on the ground of not pressed. Thus, the Court found that the impugned order of the Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi deserved to be set aside and Revision deserved to be allowed.  Accordingly, Revision was allowed and the impugned order was set-aside. The matter was remitted to Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi to dispose of the matter in accordance with provisions of law after providing an adequate opportunity of hearing to the parties.  It was also directed that Additional Sessions Judge (Rape Cases & POCSO Act) Sambhal at Chandausi shall dispose of the appeal within a period of three months noting that the revisionists are already in jail and matter relates to Section 376 I.P.C. Advocates Mohammad Khalid and Pawan Kumar Yadav appeared for the petitioners.   
The Karnataka High Court has held that the gratuity amount payable to a bank employee cannot be adjusted by the bank with his outstanding loan amount.  A single judge bench of Justice Suraj Govindaraj thus dismissed a petition filed by the Canara Bank questioning the order of Appellate Authority which set aside the order of the Controlling Authority permitting adjustment of gratuity towards loans of the employee.  The bench said, "Home loan is governed by the agreement of loan. It is for the Bank to act in terms of the said agreement and exercise all rights under the said agreement as against the debtor. The Bank could not have adjusted the same from and out of gratuity amount, which are protected under Section 7 of The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972."   Case Details:  One Srimantha D, husband of the respondent joined the service of the petitioner-Bank in 1975 as a Peon and subsequently was promoted as a Clerk in 1987. During his service, Srimantha had availed Housing Loan which was being repaid by him from time to time. In the year 2005, alleging that there is gross misconduct on his part, disciplinary proceedings were taken up. Punishment of compulsory retirement was imposed by the disciplinary authority in 2006.  An application filed by Srimantha for release of the gratuity amount came to be rejected. Hence, he had approached the Controlling Authority for a direction to make payment of the said amounts. The bank contended that there are dues liable to be paid on account of the housing loan and the dues which are due on account of the Staff Welfare Fund. These dues have to be adjusted from and out of the gratuity amount, and as such, no amount is due. The same was accepted by the authority. However, on appeal the finding was set aside and the bank was directed to pay a gratuity amount along with interest.  Findings:  The bench noted that there is a special treatment for payment of gratuity both under the Payment of Gratuity Act and also under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Gratuity has been given a special protection and special treatment inasmuch as it is made absolutely clear that the gratuity amounts can neither be attached nor can any garnishee order be passed.  Referring to Section 7 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the bench said, "The protection to gratuity is granted in order to safeguard the financial security of a person at the time of his retirement."  It noted that in the present case, the petitioner-Bank has sought to adjust a sum of Rs.9,85,420.24 towards the housing loan and a sum of Rs.1,29,691/- on account of Staff Welfare Fund liability. The Staff Welfare Fund would come within the domain of the service conditions. However, home loan occupies a completely different position inasmuch as the home loan would be governed by the terms of the loan agreement which is a commercial transaction between the bank and the debtor. Whether the debtor is an employee or not, it is the said terms of the loan which would govern the said relationship.  Noting that there is no demand made for repayment of Housing loan interest by the Bank on the employee and/or after his expiry on his legal heirs/legal representatives, the bench said, "The Bank has unilaterally on the basis of an alleged authorization, determined the amount due on its own and recovered the same from the gratuity amount payable by it."  Rejecting the contention of the bank relying on Section 10 of the Act that interest ought not to be payable on the amount and that the employee could have made an application within a period of 90 days for release of the amount, the bench said,  "The compulsory retirement order was under challenge there is no scope for the employee to have made a claim for gratuity, it is only in the year 2017 that upon he attaining the age of superannuation, that application for release of gratuity amount has been filed and consequently, the proceedings before the Labour Court were also withdrawn. Therefore, I am of the considered opinion that there is no delay in filing the application for payment of gratuity amounts."  It added, "In terms of the proviso to sub clause (iii) of sub Rule (1) of Rule 10, the Authority is also authorised to condone the delay if any. There is neither restriction on the period which could be condoned nor there is an embargo imposed under the said Rules which would disentitle the applicant to receive any interest."  Accordingly, the court directed the bank to comply with the order of the appellate authority  Case Title: M/S CANARA BANK v.

The Court said the the percentage of loss of earning capacity cannot be always equated with the percentage of permanent disability.The Supreme Court has held that the loss of earning capacity must be fixed as 100% when a claimant-motor accident victim is incapacitated for life and is confined to home.A person therefore is not only to be compensated for the injury suffered due to the accident but also for the loss suffered on account of the injury and his inability to lead the life he led, prior to the life... The Supreme Court has held that the loss of earning capacity must be fixed as 100% when a claimant-motor accident victim is incapacitated for life and is confined to home. A person therefore is not only to be compensated for the injury suffered due to the accident but also for the loss suffered on account of the injury and his inability to lead the life he led, prior to the life altering event  the bench of Justices R. Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy observed.  The court added that the extent of economic loss arising from a disability may not be measured in proportions to the extent of permanent disability. "While the money awarded by Courts can hardly redress the actual sufferings of the injured victim (who is deprived of the normal amenities of life and suffers the unease of being a burden on others), the courts can make a genuine attempt to help restore the self-dignity of such claimant, by awarding 'just compensation' ", the bench remarked. The court was considering the appeal filed by a person who suffered serious injuries from an accident. He was riding pillion in a bike when it was hit by a car. Both riders were impacted, resulting in severe head injuries to the appellant. He was bedridden, totally immobilized and initially, remained admitted in the hospital for 191 days. He has also suffered severe impairment of cognitive power with hemiparesis and total aphasia and the prognosis for him is 69%permanent disability. In appeal, he submitted that he suffered 69% permanent disability and is unable to perform everyday activities and he requires constant support even for the confined life that he is leading. He also questioned the logic of the logic of restricting the compensation to 69% under the head of permanent disability when his  earning capacity is reduced to zero (notwithstanding his 69% permanent disability). The bench observed that the Motor Vehicles Act is in the nature of social welfare legislation and its provisions make it clear that the compensation should be justly determined. "While the permanent disability as certified by the doctors stands at 69%,the same by no means, adequately reflects the travails the impaired claimant will have to face all his life. The 21 year old's youthful dreams and future hopes were snuffed out by the serious accident. The young man's impaired condition has certainly impacted his family members. Their resources and strength are bound to be stressed by the need to provide full time care to the claimant. For the appellant to constantly rely on them for stimulation and support is destined to cause emotional, physical and financial fatigue for all stakeholders .", the court said. The court noted that even though the physical disability is assessed at 69%, the functional disability is 100% in so far as claimant's loss of earning capacity is concerned. 12. The Courts should strive to provide a realistic recompense having regard to the realities of life, both in terms of assessment of the extent of disabilities and its impact including the income generating capacity of the claimant. In cases of similar nature, wherein the claimant is suffering severe cognitive dysfunction and restricted mobility, the Courts should be mindful of the fact that even though the physical disability is assessed at 69%, the functional disability is 100% in so far as claimant's loss of earning capacity is concerned. The court therefore held that his loss of earning capacity must be fixed at 100%. An amount of Rs.27,67,800/- was directed to be given as compensation to him. While allowing the appeal, the bench made the following 19. Before parting, it needs emphasizing that in cases such as this, the Tribunal and the Courts must be conscious of the fact that the permanent disability Page 17 of 20 suffered by the individual not only impairs his cognitive abilities and his physical facilities but there are multiple other non-quantifiable implications for the victim. The very fact that a healthy person turns into an invalid, being deprived of normal companionship, and incapable of leading a productive life, makes one suffer the loss of self-dignity. Such a Claimant must not be viewed as a modern day Oliver Twist, having to make entreaties as the boy in the orphanage in Charles Dickens's classic, "Please Sir, I want some more". The efforts must be to substantially ameliorate the misery of the claimant and recognize his actual needs by accounting for the ground realities. The measures should however be in correct proportion. As is aptly said by Justice R.V Raveendran, while speaking for the Division Bench in Sarla Verma and Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Another , just compensation is adequate compensation and the Award must be just that- no less and no more. The plea 8 (2009)6 SCC 121 Page 18 of 20 of the victim suffering from a cruel twist of fate, when asking for some more, is not extravagant but is for seeking appropriate recompense to negotiate with the unforeseeable and the fortuitous twists is his impaired life. Therefore, while the money awarded by Courts can hardly redress the actual sufferings of the injured victim (who is deprived of the normal amenities of life and suffers the unease of being a burden on others), the courts can make a genuine attempt to help restore the self-dignity of such claimant, by awarding 'just compensation'.

"It is irony and tragedy of the Indian republic and biggest scar on Indian democracy that criminals like Mukhtar Ansari are the law-makers," the Allahabad High Court observed on Tuesday as it denied bail to former UP MLA in a case wherein he has been accused of registering an ambulance on forged and fabricated document. The bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh further observed that since the ambulance was allegedly being used to carry Ansari's men armed with illegal and sophisticated weapons for his protection, therefore, there was no ground to enlarge him on bail. The case against him Essentially, yhe case against Ansari is that on December 21, 2013, an ambulance was registered in the Transport Department of Barabanki in the name of Dr. Alka Rai on the basis of forged documents. When the matter was investigated, Dr. Alka Rai herself admitted that people associated with Mukhtar Ansari had brought some documents to him and she was pressurized to put her signature on those papers. It came to light during the investigation that the real beneficiary and user of the vehicle was Ansari and he got the said vehicle purchased in the name of Dr. Alka Rai by pressurizing her and the payment was allegedly made by him. Further, the vehicle was recovered from Mohali, Punjab, and it was found that it was being used by Ansari and his henchmen for going to court from jail and his henchmen would travel in the ambulance armed with sophisticated weapons to escort him. Thereafter, Ansari was booked under Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B, 177 and 506 IPC and Section 7 Criminal Law Amendment Act. After his bail plea was rejected by Special Judge (MP/MLA)/Additional District Judge, Barabanki, he moved to the High Court. Court's observations  The Court took into account the statements made by Dr. Alka rai and noted that other co-accused had corroborated the allegation against Ansari regarding the purchase of the said ambulance on the basis of the forged and fabricated documents in the name of Dr. Alka Rai for his own use. Based on the statement of one accused, the Court also noted that once in Lucknow, one Reporter had clicked the photo of the said ambulance, and then henchmen of the accused applicant had assaulted the said Reporter badly.  Consequently, taking into account the long criminal history of Ansari of most heinous offences and looking at the facts of the case that the ambulance was allegedly being used to carry his men armed with illegal and sophisticated weapons for his protection, the Court found that there was no ground to enlarge him on bail.  "The accused applicant commands un-parallel fear in the minds and hearts of the people that no one dares to challenge him and his men and his politics. If the accused-applicant is enlarged on bail, the apprehension of the prosecution that he would tamper with the evidence and influence the witnesses, cannot be ruled out," the Court further noted as it denied bail to him.

The Kerala High Court has ruled that under Rules 97 and 98 of Part I of the Kerala Service Rules, a government employee who meets with an accident while travelling from their residence to workplace is entitled to special disability leave. A Division Bench comprising Justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Mohammed Nias C.P observed:"...the phrase 'caused in, or in consequence of... The Kerala High Court has ruled that under Rules 97 and 98 of Part I of the Kerala Service Rules, a government employee who meets with an accident while travelling from their residence to workplace is entitled to special disability leave.  A Division Bench comprising Justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Mohammed Nias C.P observed: "...the phrase 'caused in, or in consequence of due performance of his official duties or in consequence of his official position', which appear in both the Rules aforementioned, cannot be construed in a narrow and pedantic fashion so as to exclude a person who was admittedly an employee, who was travelling from her residence to the place of work at the time when the accident took place." Brief Facts: The petitioner, a Higher Secondary School teacher met with an accident while she was riding her scooter on her way to school from her residence. She sustained serious injuries and was hospitalised and under treatment  Later on, she claimed the benefit of special disability leave in terms of Rules 97 and 98 but her claim was rejected by the Regional Deputy Director of Higher Secondary Education. Therefore, she preferred an appeal before the Government, but to no avail.  When this Government Order was challenged before a Single Bench of this Court, the competent authority was directed to take up the application of the petitioner again and pass a fresh order thereon.  However, her claim was rejected again on the ground that the accident that occurred in the course of travel of the petitioner from her residence to the school could not be considered as one that occurred during the performance of her official duties.  Challenging this, the petitioner moved the Court and the Single Judge found that the injury she suffered while she was on her way to work had to be seen as an injury suffered consequent on her employment. Accordingly, the respondents were directed to sanction the special disability leave applied for by the petitioner. Against this decision of the Single Judge, the respondents preferred an appeal.  Senior Government Pleader A.J. Varghese referred to Rules 97 and 98 to argue that the injury suffered by the petitioner could not be seen as either caused in, or in consequence of the due performance of her official duties or in consequence of her official position.  It was argued that the travel from her residence to the school could not be seen as travel in connection with her employment.  The petitioners were represented by Advocates K. Sasikumar, P.S. Raghukumar, S. Aravind and K. Janardhana Shenoy. Findings: Dismissing the appeal, the Division Bench observed: "A mere perusal of the provisions of Part I KSR which deal with various kinds of leave would reveal the underlying scheme therein which is that the sanction of various kinds of leave are contemplated only once it is established that the employee – employer relationship continues to exist without interruption." It was further noted that the difference in the kinds of leave sanctioned is only in respect of the periods for which an employee can remain absent from work and the monetary benefits, if any, that will be paid to the employee during the said period.  "Thus, when the provisions of Rules  97 and 98 of Part I KSR that prescribe the conditions for the grant of leave are interpreted, the interpretation to be placed must be one that recognizes the above scheme and its intent, and furthers such intent." The Court took the view on such interpretation, an employee who met with an accident while travelling from her residence to the place of work would be included within the ambit of the Rules.  As such, the appeal was dismissed.  Case Title: State of Kerala & Ors v.

The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday denied bail to Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan in connection with the 'Hathras Conspiracy Case' as it noted that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accusations against Kappan are prima facie true. At the outset, the Court noted that during the investigation, it had come on record that Kappan had no work at Hathras when he was arrested. "The State machinery was at tenterhooks owing to the tension prevailing due to various types of information being viral across all forums of media including the internet. The said sojourn of the applicant with co-accused persons who do not belong to media fraternity is a crucial circumstance going against him," the Court further said.  It may be noted that Kappan along with other accused were arrested by the UP police in October 2020 while they were proceeding to report the Hathras rape-murder crime.  Initially, they were arrested under the apprehension of causing a breach of peace and were produced before a court of the sub-divisional magistrate which sent them to judicial custody.  Subsequently, they were booked under the UAPA alleging that he and his co-passengers were trying to incite communal riots and disrupt social harmony in the wake of the Hathras gangrape-murder case.  Kappan had moved the Court after a local court in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh had rejected his bail plea last year in July.  In the bail order, the Bench of Justice Krishna Pahal referred to Apex Court's ruling in the case of National Investigation Agency vs. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, wherein it was held that Section 43(D)(5) of the UAPA prohibits a Court from granting bail to accused, if, on a perusal of a final report filed under Section 173 Cr.P.C., the Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accusations against such person are prima facie true.  The case in brief  As per the prosecution's case, Kappan along with three coaccused persons, were arrested with six smartphones, one laptop and pamphlets while they were on their way to Hathras.  The FIR alleged that he and other coaccused persons were heading to Hathras where the ill-fated incident of rape and murder had been committed with an intention to create caste struggle and incite riots.   The prosecution alleged that Kappan and others were collecting funds and running a website 'Carrd.com' so as to break the social harmony and incite violence.   It was further alleged that the said website also imparted training on concealing one's identity during demonstrations and ways to incite violence. The website was found to be full of misinformation, distorting true facts.   It was argued before the Court that Kappan is a resident of Kerala and has nothing to do with the incident of Hathras and he had come to hathras deliberately with a malafide intention.  It was also alleged that the applicant was in regular touch with the General Secretary of P.F.I. Kamal K.P., and the WhatsApp chats revealed that workshops had been conducted by the applicant and other co-accused persons to incite riots across the country, by raking up issues of C.A.A. and Babri Masjid demolition.  Lastly, it was submitted that in all, 45 papers pertaining to the banned organization 'SIMI' have been recovered from the laptop of the applicant and that he had also received tainted money which is on record.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that during the investigation, it had come on record that Kappan had no work at Hathras when he was arrested.   "The State machinery was at tenterhooks owing to the tension prevailing due to various types of information being viral across all forums of media including the internet. The said sojourn of the applicant with co-accused persons who do not belong to media fraternity is a crucial circumstance going against him," the Court fuether said.   The Court further said that the defence taken by Kappan that he is a journalist and only owing to his professional duty, he wanted to visit the place of Hathras incident, stood nullified by the averments in the charge-sheet and the persons, he was arrested while travelling in a car.   "The tainted money being used by the applicant and his colleagues cannot be ruled out," the Court added as it denied bail to Kappan noting that a perusal of the charge-sheet and documents adduced, prima facie revealed that the applicant has committed the offence Case title - Sidhique Kappan v. State Of U.P.Thru.Prin.Secy.Home Lko.

The Supreme Court has observed that once the witness is in the witness box and is being cross examined, every endeavour must be made to ensure that the cross examination is completed on that day.  The bench of Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh rendered this observation while considering a SLP assailing Allahabad High Court's order dated March 19, 2021 ("impugned order").  In the impugned order, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the applicant against whom an FIR was registered under Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 406 506, 392, 120-B IPC.  Appearing for the petitioner, counsel submitted that whenever the first witness was under cross examination and after a couple of questions the matter was deferred. He also apprised the Court that there were 4 private witnesses in the case.  Expressing its disapproval with regards to the deference of matter, the bench in their order said,  "Once the witness is in the witness box and is being cross examined every endeavour must be made to ensure that the cross examination is completed on that day. This is more so looking into the nature of the case before the Court which is not a complex criminal trial.We expect the trial Court to complete the examination of the private witnesses before the next date."

Welfare Of The Child Born Out Of Illicit Relations Of Paramount Importance – Bombay HC Reduces Life Sentence Of The Accused To 10 Years, Directs Compensation For The Child After Maternal DeathReducing the life sentence awarded to a rape convict to 10 years, the Bombay High Court directed him to pay compensation to the child born out of his illicit acts observing that the baby was also "victim" as contemplated under Section 2(wa) of the CrPc.

Reducing the life sentence awarded to a rape convict to 10 years, the Bombay High Court directed him to pay compensation to the child born out of his illicit acts observing that the baby was also "victim" as contemplated under Section 2(wa) of the CrPc.  The 15-year-old rape victim had died four days after childbirth in 2015.   A division bench of Justices Sadhana S. Jadhav and Prithviraj K. Chavan observed that the child's welfare was of paramount importance and directed the accused - Ramesh Tukaram Vavekar – to pay compensation of Rs 2 lakhs. It appointed the Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Mumbai as the guardian of the victim child (boy), currently in an orphanage.    "We have given our thoughtful consideration to the entire facts and circumstances of the case. No doubt, the victim is no more. However, now the welfare of the child born out of illicit relations between the victim girl and the appellant would be of paramount importance. As abundant caution as well as in view of public policy, law cannot afford to allow such consequence befalling an innocent child only because he was abandoned by a father (appellant)."  The court held that according to Section 2(w a) of the CrPC, the "victim" includes the child born to the victim, as he is indeed her legal heir and therefore, he must be adequately compensated. "It was the appellant who is responsible for bringing him in this world and then abandoning him at the mercy of an Orphanage." The victim had not only been abandoned by the appellant but also by her real mother(PW 1). They did not stop there but had put the life of the newly born child into jeopardy by sending him in an Orphanage. In view of Section 2(w a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the "victim" means a person who has suffered any loss or injury caused by reason of the act or omission for which the accused person has been charged and expression "victim" includes his or her guardian or legal heir. The child born to the victim is indeed her legal heir and also a victim in view of the definition of "victim" and therefore, he must be adequately compensated for as it was the appellant who is responsible for bringing him in this world and then abandoning him at the mercy of an Orphanage  The court further observed that no fruitful purpose would be served considering the young age and future prospects of the accused.   "Looking to the young age of the appellant and his future prospects in his profession as a Disk Jocky as well as the fact of his willingness to provide adequate compensation to the child, we are of the considered view that, no fruitful purpose would be served in detaining the appellant for his entire life, instead, if the amount of compensation to be awarded to the child, is adequate, it would serve the ends of justice."  The court said that SDLSA shall take necessary steps as per Rule 7 of the POCSO Rules, which shall be payable by the State Government from the victims Compensation Fund for compensating and rehabilitating victims u/s 357-A of the CrPC.   Facts of the Case   Accused Tukaram Vavekar approached the HC against his conviction and sentence u/s 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 by which he was imprisoned for life and directed to pay a fine of Rs 2000.  It was the prosecution's case that on October 8, 2015 the victim, a standard 10 student of 15 years, fell unconscious in the middle of the night and had to be rushed to the hospital where she delivered a child. However, her condition deteriorated and she died the very same day from cerebral oedema, which includes renal failure.   The family had learned about her pregnancy when she was 8months pregnant and lodged a complaint. The police arrested Vavekar based on witness statements and call records. However, the most damning piece of evidence was the child's DNA.   The defence argued that the victim was a major at the time of the alleged incident. Therefore, sections of POCSO wouldn't be attracted. Moreover, the testimony of the witnesses was not believable and the seizure of the mobile phone wasn't proved.   The APP argued that there is hardly any room for doubt as regards complicity of the appellant in committing penetrative aggravated sex with the victim by impregnating her and then ultimately resulting into her death. Moreover, a lenient view shouldn't be taken especially since the victim's family was won over by the accused.  Observations   The court held that the prosecution proved that the victim girl was 14 years old at the time of the incident.   The court noted that the mother falsely deposed that her daughter was born in 1996 and was a major. "It is quite apparent from the evidence of this witness though she was aware of the facts, but had deliberately kept mum for reasons best known to her."  The court held the accused responsible for his child now spending days at an orphanage. "It has been conclusively proved that he is the biological father of the male child ill-begotten to the victim. He, therefore, can not absolve himself from the said offence as well as the fact that it is he who is responsible for putting the life of not only the victim but also the newly born into jeopardy."

"What is material to attract offense under section 307 of the IPC is the intention or knowledge with which all the acts are done irrespective of its results", the Gujarat High Court has held recently.  Justice Sandeep Bhatt made this observation in connection with a criminal appeal challenging the order of acquittal of the accused for offences under Sections 147 (Rioting), 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149/143 (Unlawful assembly), 307 (Attempt to murder), 323 (Voluntarily causing hurt), 325 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506(2) (Criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.  Background  It was the case of the Prosecution that Accused No. 3, 9 and 10 attacked the Complainant due to a previous grudge about an election. The Complainant received blows on the back and thigh and then all three ran away from the place of offence. They also threatened to kill the Complainant. Thereafter, the Complainant was admitted in the hospital and an FIR was registered at the police station under the aforementioned sections.   During the trial, the Prosecution examined 19 witnesses and presented various documentary evidence to bring home the charge. Per contra, the Respondent-Accused refuted all the charges as false. Accordingly, after examining the evidence and witnesses, the Trial Court acquitted the Respondent-Accused.  The Bench noted that there was discrepancy in the complaint since one of the alleged attackers was handicap from the middle part of the body and could not walk without the help of the stick. Further, there were discrepancies in the statements regarding hospitalisation of the Complainant. For instance, the Complainant deposed that he was in the hospital for 9 days, but during cross-examination, he stated that he was admitted for 11 days. While another witness stated that he was in the hospital for 6 days. Per the Bench, this amounted to material contradiction. The Complainant changed his version of the injuries, as well. The Trial Court had also noted that the investigation was not conducted properly since the sequence of the investigation was not articulated coherently.   Keeping in mind these discrepancies, the Trial Court had rightly acquitted the Accused, the High Court said. It thereafter, ventured on to explain the ingredients of Section 307 thus:  "It is pertinent to note that the prosecution is required to prove the intention or knowledge of the accused persons, however, it is necessary that the prosecution is required to prove the intention or knowledge of the accused persons and it is not necessary that injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted by the accused persons. What is material to attract offense under section 307 of the IPC is the intention or knowledge with which all the acts are done irrespective of its results."  Averring that nothing on the part of the Respondent-Accused was found to show an intention to commit act or attempt to commit murder, the Bench affirmed the decision of the Trial Court. In doing so, the Bench cautioned that as per Ram Kumar vs State of Haryana AIR 1995 SC 280, it was held:  "It is settled law that if the main grounds on which the lower Court has based its order acquitting the accused are reasonable and plausible, and the same cannot entirely and effectively be dislodged or demolished, the High Court should not disturb the order of acquittal."  The Bench further remarked:  "Every case has its own journey towards the truth and it is the Court's role undertake. Truth has to be found on the basis of evidence available before it. There is no room for subjectivity nor the nature of offence affects its performance. We have a hierarchy of courts in dealing with cases. An Appellate Court shall not expect the trial Court to act in a particular way depending upon the sensitivity of the case. Rather it should be appreciated if a trial Court decides a case on its own merits despite its sensitivity."  Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently held that a 'pseudo police report' under section 173 CrPC, even if filed within time frame of section 167 CrPC, cannot be given legal sanctity to betray the statutory/default bail right of an accused in a case. A bench of Justice Rahul Bharti observed,  "This right, upon getting accrued, is given straight away on asking of the entitled accused notwithstanding the purported gravity of the accusation of offence/s against the accused under pre-trial custody".  The observations were made while hearing a plea seeking a default bail under the aegis of Section 167(2) CrPC as the very same relief had been denied to the petitioner by the Sessions Judge Udhampur.  The petitioners were praying for a statutory/default bail riding on the premise that the failure on the part of the Investigation Authority of the Police Station Udhampur to submit a cognizable final police report/ challan under section 173 CrPC within the given period of 90 days had afforded the right to ask for bail in the matter.  The petitioners, four in number, were arrested in an FIR and on the 79th day after their arrest, a purported Police Report/ Challan alleging offences under sections 302/202/34 IPC was presented against the petitioners before the court of Sessions Judge Udhampur.  When the Sessions Judge came to take the opening of the matter under Sec 226 CrPC, he had found out the charge sheet was an empty formality and being unable to frame the charge against the accused had accordingly granted 15 days’ time to conclude the investigation supervised and monitored by SSP Udhampur.  Missing the 15 day deadline also the SHO Police Station Udhampur came to submit a final police report styled as supplementary charge sheet. It is with respect to this charge sheet that the court of Sessions Judge Udhampur came to put up the case for arguments on charge. Meanwhile, after passing of the order dated 21.02.2022 of return of the so called final Police Report/challan by the court of Sessions Judge Udhampur, the petitioners had come to file an application for grant of default bail which was dismissed after more than eight months.  Commenting on the contents of the bail rejection order, Justice Bharti observed that Sessions Judge, Udhampur had literally dealt with the case as if situation concerning the petitioners was of post conviction and the petitioners were asking for suspension of sentence and bail. Justice Bharti added that the Court of Sessions Judge, Udhampur "evaded" to refer to its own observation on record that the first police report so filed against the petitioners was an empty formality. "If that was the state of the purported police report/challan then that would have meant only one thing in the eyes of law which is that the presentation of said police report was a pseudo police report/challan aimed with sole objective to cover up the default on the part of the Police Station, Udhampur to complete the investigation within the time given so as to checkmate the petitioners becoming entitled to default bail", the bench reasoned.  Deliberating further on the matter the court said that after having held the purported Police Report/Challan so filed under section 173 CrPC as an empty formality and returning it, the Sessions Judge Udhampur cannot be said to have taken cognizance of the offences.  The Court observed that a criminal court, be it of a magistrate or a sessions judge, are not meant to be seen as if "assisting" police investigation or prosecution against an accused. It frowned by saying that a clear cut case of grant of default bail in favour of the petitioners was "aborted" by the said approach of the Sessions Court, Udhampur.  Keeping in view the errors which the Sessions Judge Udhampur had fallen for both on the counts of law and fact, the court held the petitioners to be entitled to grant of the statutory/default bail and directed the Court of Sessions Judge, to grant statutory/default bail in favour of the petitioners subject to terms and conditions as may be deemed fit.

The Karnataka High Court has said filing of a common charge-sheet for complaints filed by the individual investors against the same accused in different police stations is against the law and filing amalgamated charge-sheet is impermissible under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)  A single bench of Justice K Natarajan held :  "The State-C.I.D. Police have no authority to file a common charge-sheet in different complaints. However, the Investigating Officer has to file a separate charge sheet against each crime registered by the Police on individual complaint. Thereafter, the Special Court shall take cognizance of the offences both punishable under the IPC and the Special Act by following the Cr.P.C. and dispose of the matter in accordance with law."  The court relied on the order to Delhi High Court in the case of STATE v. KHIMJI BHAI JADEJA (Crl. Ref. No.1 of 2014 dated 8-7-2019) which had considered the judgments of various High Courts as well as Supreme Court and held that filing an amalgamated charge-sheet is impermissible.  It said "The offences which are similar in nature committed by the same accused within twelve months can be tried together by framing a common charge as per Section 219 of the Cr.P.C, but the question of filing a common charge-sheet in multiple crimes or complaints is impermissible."  The CID had moved the court challenging an order dated 8-8-2016 passed by the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Mysuru, for having rejected the charge-sheet filed by the Police Inspector, Financial and Vigilance Unit, C.I.D.  Justice Nataranjan also set aside the order of the special court discharging the accused Greenbuds Agro Farms Limited Company and accused Nos.2 to 5 are the Managing Directors and Directors of the said Company, alleged of duping investors.  The court had rejected the charge-sheet filed under the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act, 2004, on the ground that the Police Inspector is not the Competent Officer to file the report or for taking action and hence, the accused were discharged for the offence punishable under Section 9 of the Act. However, liberty was granted to the Investigating Officer to file a charge-sheet before the jurisdictional Magistrate for the offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code.  The court said "Though the Trial Court rightly refused to accept the charge-sheet, but committed an error in discharging the accused and directing the Investigating Officer to file the charge-sheet before the jurisdictional Magistrate. Once the Special Court is established, the question of discharging the accused for the reasons that the charge-sheet is filed by incompetent Investigating Officer does not arise. The Trial Court misread the provisions of the Special Act and has not considered Section 4 of the Cr.P.C."  It added "As per Section 4(2) of the Cr.P.C., all offences under any other law shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. Such being the case, bifurcating the offences punishable under IPC and Special Law is not correct. Both the offences are required to be tried together by the Special Court established under the Act."  The court while quashing the order of the special court directed "Further, the Special Court is directed to return the charge-sheet to the Investigating Officer in order to file separate charge-sheet in respect of each individual complaint and thereafter, the Trial Court shall proceed in accordance with law."     
The Karnataka High Court has come to the aid of 102 years old Freedom Fighter and has directed the Ministry of Home Affairs to pay arrears of pension which were withheld for a year as he was unable to submit the Life Certificate to the bank. A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna said “Ebbing mental prowess and physical incapacity due to age was one of the prime reasons why the certificate could not be submitted in time. This, in the peculiar facts of this case, by no stretch of imagination, can be construed to take away the right of the petitioner for grant of pension, particularly, in the teeth of the guidelines.”  The bench directed the respondent to pay arrears of pension which is quantified at 3,71,280 along with interest at 6% per annum from 24-12-2018 till date of payment. Further it imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh to be paid by respondents jointly, to the petitioner H.Nagabhushana Rao, within two weeks.  On 01-11-2017 the pension of the petitioner was abruptly stopped. When enquired about the reason for such stoppage, it was indicated to the petitioner that he had not submitted his Life Certificate for the year 2017-2018 and later he submitted the Life Certificate on 24-12-2018. Then the Government issued a sanction letter belatedly releasing pension for the period from 24-12-2018 to 05- 10-2020. However, the arrears of pension between 01-11-2017 to 24-12-2018 were not paid, which amounted to 3,71,280.  Thus the petitioner approached the court seeking directions to release of arrears of pension. The court vide its order 24-06-2020 directed the respondents to take appropriate action within two weeks. When nothing came about, the petitioner moved a contempt petition, pursuant to which, the Ministry issued a sanction letter dated 05-10-2020. However, pension for the period from 01-11-2017 to 24-12-2018 was not released on the specious plea that the petitioner had not submitted a Life Certificate.  Again the petitioner approached the court which by its order dated 10-06-2022 considering the purport of guidelines for grant of such pension allowed the petition in part and directed the 4th respondent therein, Government of India to take appropriate decision in terms of the Scheme for disbursement of pension after assessing entitlement of the petitioner.  Pursuant to the order passed by the Court and claiming to be considering the grievance of the petitioner, a communication was issued on 13-09- 2022 directing that the petitioner is not entitled to the arrears for the solitary reason that the petitioner did not submit a Life Certificate in November, 2017.  The Union government submitted that it is in no way responsible for deduction or non-payment of pension and non-submission of Life Certificate would automatically stall pension. Therefore, submission of Life Certificate to the Bank and such entry being made by the Bank is imperative. If at all someone is responsible, it is the Bank officials and not the Union of India, it was argued. Counsel for the Bank argued that Life Certificate has to be submitted by the freedom fighter under the Scheme and that there is no duty of the Bank officials to go and collect the Life Certificate.  The court noted that the petitioner was a recipient of Swatantra Sainik Samman Gaurava Dhana (Pension), being a freedom fighter, from 1974 from the Government of India. Then referring to the policy Guidelines with regard to payment of pension under the Central Samman Pension Scheme, it said, “The guidelines would direct that in case where the pensioner does not submit the Life Certificate, the Bank would stop the pension and leave the matter at rest. The guidelines would indicate that it was not enough and it is expected from the Bank that, apart from stopping pension, it should immediately visit the pensioner to find out why he or she did not submit the Life Certificate. The guidelines direct that this will help the Bank to timely update the data in case the pensioner has died and recover any excess payment.” Following which it said “If the pensioner is too old to come to the Bank, it is the Bank officer who should visit his/her residence before obtaining the Life Certificate. Clause 2.4 mandates that stopping of pension is not enough but it is expected from the officers of the Bank that they immediately visit the pensioner to find out why he or she did not submit the Life Certificate.”  On going through the records the bench said “Though submission of Life Certificate is imperative in terms of the guidelines and duty is cast on every pensioner to submit a Life Certificate, certain duty is also cast upon the Bank officials as well.”  Further it said “The duty that is cast upon the Bank officials is that they should visit a person whose Life Certificate has not come about immediately to update their data with regard to restoration of pension or otherwise.”  Then it held “The duty of the Bank is given a go bye. Vehement objections are put up by the learned counsel appearing for the Bank in order to save the officers who have derelicted in their duty in not adhering to the guidelines.”  The bench regretted over the apathy displayed by the officers concerned towards the petitioner who was then 97 years old. “The petitioner would be entitled to all the arrears along with interest, as the Bank has failed to collect Life Certificate from the hands of the petitioner in terms of the guidelines. The Bank ought to have visited the petitioner and collected the Life Certificate and regulated pension,” court held. However, it clarified that not in every case the Bank is obliged to do so. In cases where there are genuine problems of pensioners who are unable to visit up to the Bank, it is the duty of the Bank officers to visit those persons and take Life Certificate and update them on the system.  The court opined “Pensio is trite, not a bounty. In a broader significance, it is a measure of socio-economic justice, which inheres economic security, in the fall of life when physical and mental capabilities of a pensioner begins to ebb corresponding to the ageing process. The raison d’etre for grant of pension is the inability to provide for oneself due to such old age. This can be withheld, curtailed or taken away, only in accordance with law.”  Following which it allowed the petition.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday upheld the life sentence awarded to a man who had raped his own 12-year-old niece in the year 2008. Noting that the accused was the real uncle of the victim, the Court remarked thus: "The factual matrix of this appeal is unfortunately related to a sordid and obnoxious incident, where the appellant, who is the real uncle of the victim, raped his niece, a girl child of the tender age of 12 years. The result was that the sacred relationship of uncle and niece was besmirched. Such offenders are a menace to the civilised society and have to be dealt with strictly as per law. It is an act, which is not only a blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity, it degrades and humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless child or a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. Such crime is not only a crime against a minor innocent child, rather it is a crime against the entire society." With this, the bench of Justice Sureshwar Thakur and Justice N. S. Shekhawat dismissed an appeal filed by the accused (Chaman Lal Chimnu) against the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Kurukshetra. The facts in brief On August 19, 2008, when the complainant (father of the victim) and his wife (mother of the victim) had gone to Kurukshetra for taking the medicines, the victim's uncle Chaman Lal @ Chimnu (appellant/accused) had entered their house and after turning out her younger brothers and sisters, he had forcibly taken the 'victim' inside the room, after catching her from her arms.  The accused committed rape upon her and thereafter, he went away and threatened that he would kill the victim, in case she reported the matter to anybody. On the next day, when the complainant and his wife saw his daughter lying silently and fearfully on the cot, they enquired from her gently, on which she started weeping and told about the incident. The matter was reported to the police and the victim's statement was recorded and the accused was arrested. Thereafter, the police found sufficient incriminating evidence against the appellant/accused and presented the final report under Section 173 of the CrPC.  The accused opted not to lead evidence in his defence during the course of the trial. Vide the impugned judgment and order passed by the court of Additional Sessions Judge, Kurukshetra, the appellant was held guilty under Sections 376, 452, and 506 IPC and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Against his conviction, the accused moved to the High Court. Court's observations  The Court didn't find any substance in the argument of the accused that he had been implicated in the case over some ancestral property dispute. The Court also found that the 'victim' had narrated the entire incident in her testimony and her testimony inspired confidence. The Court also opined that it was inconceivable that a girl of 12 years of age would invent on her own a false story of sexual assault/rape upon her by her own real uncle and that it was unthinkable that the parents would tutor their minor daughter to concoct such a story in order to wreak vengeance on some one "They would not do so for the simple reason that it would bring down their own social status in the society apart from ruining future prospects of their own child. They would also be expected to be conscious of the traumatic effect on the psychology of the child and the disastrous consequences likely to ensue when she grows up. We, therefore, refuse to countenance the suggestions made by the learned defence counsel that the appellant had been falsely roped at the instance of the father of the victim," the Court remarked. Consequently, rejecting the evidence of PW-10 Ashok Kumar and PW-11 the 'victim' on the basis of minor discrepancies, which are bound to creep in the testimonies of truthful witnesses, the Court found no substance in the arguments raised by the counsel for the appellant and thus, the present appeal was dismissed, being devoid of any merit.

The Karnataka High Court has clarified that the Administrative Tribunal constituted under the Administrative Tribunals Act 1985, has the jurisdiction to consider all matters 'concerning recruitment' which includes all decisions from the date of publication of notification inviting applications for the government job posts to the orders of appointment.  A single judge bench Justice Anant Ramanath Hegde sitting at Kalaburagi bench gave the clarification while disposing of a petition filed by one Ameena Afroj, who had questioned the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in adjudicating over the challenge made by her to the decision of the Deputy Director of Public Instructions, classifying the petitioner as a General Merit candidate instead of under the category 2-B/KA-HK for selection to the post of a government school teacher.  The petitioner’s counsel had submitted that the issue is pertaining to the petitioner’s caste and income and the same is outside the purview of the Administrative Tribunal and it should be considered only by this Court in the exercise of power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.  Further, even assuming that the Tribunal has got the jurisdiction to deal with this matter under Section 15 of the Act, the alternative remedy by itself will not oust the jurisdiction of the High Court.  Finally it was said the present writ petition is to enforce the petitioner’s fundamental right under Article 14 of the Constitution of India as the persons who are similarly placed, are classified in the 2-B/KA-HK category.  Findings:  The bench referred to Section 15 of the Act which deals with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Noting that the expression ‘recruitment’ and ‘matters concerning recruitment’ found in Section 15 (1) (a) are not defined in the Act, the Court said it has to apply the plain grammatical meaning attached to the above-said expressions. It said, “The plain dictionary meaning of the expression ‘recruitment’ itself uses the phrase ‘the process of finding new people’...Parliament itself has used the expression, ‘matters concerning recruitment’ in Section 15 (1) (a) of the Act. The said expression undoubtedly has a wider connotation than the expression ‘recruitment’...leads to only one conclusion that the decision taken in processing the application for the post is a decision relating to recruitment or the matters concerning to recruitment.”  The Court said that while processing the applications for the posts, if a decision is taken to classify the applicant in a particular category, as happened in the case of the petitioner, ‘the decision taken’ is indeed a decision taken in the process of recruitment.  It added “The expressions ‘recruitment’ and 'matters concerning recruitment’ found in Section 15 (1) (a) of the Act, are wide enough to cover all the stages of recruitment, starting from the publication of notification inviting applications to the Civil services and Civil Posts, to the scrutiny of applications and the decisions thereon, conducting examinations, announcement of the results and issuance of orders of appointment. Such being the ambit of Section 15 (1)(a) of the Act, the impugned decision to classify the petitioner under the ‘General Merit’ category is a decision, the correctness of which can be reviewed by the Tribunal.”  Further referring to Section 28 of the Act, which excludes the jurisdiction of all courts, in respect of matters over which, the Tribunal under the Act, exercises the jurisdiction, except the Supreme Court and the Labour Courts and other authorities under the Industrial Disputes Act, the bench said “Combined reading of Sections 15 and 28 of the Act, leads to an inevitable conclusion that the High Court cannot exercise the jurisdiction as a Court of first instance in respect of the matters over which the Tribunals under the Act are empowered to exercise the jurisdiction. The Act not only provides for the jurisdiction of the Tribunals under Section 15 but also provides for the exclusion of the jurisdiction of several Courts including the High Court.”  The court also held that the petitioner has not made out a case to entertain the writ petition despite an alternative remedy being available. Also it junked the contention that the petitioner is seeking to enforce her fundamental right. It said “No such grounds are forthcoming in the writ petition.”  Accordingly it dismissed the petition and held that “The Tribunal is the forum of first instance and not the High Court to adjudicate the disputes falling under Section 15 of the Act.”  Case Title: Ameena Afroj And State of Karnataka & others  Case No: W.P.No.200032/2023  Date of Order: 12-01-2023  Appearance: Advocate K.M.Ghate for petitioner.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently upheld an eviction order passed against a son and his wife at the instance of the father under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 (Senior Citizens Act). In this case, the father had not transferred the house in question to the son by way of gift or any other deed.  The son sought to maintain the claim by saying that he had contributed to the renovation of the ground floor of the house. The Court held that the son cannot insist that he has the right to stay in his father's home by saying that he has contributed to the renovation of the house. "...the petitioners cannot maintain their claim on the alleged ground that petitioner No.1 had contributed towards the renovation of the house", the Court observed.  The Court underscored that when children throw their parents at the mercy of their destiny and use their muscle power to torture and harass them, then parents' world gets totally shattered.  "They become helpless from all sides and thus, begins the unfortunate tale of their moving from one Forum to another for redressal of their grievance(s)....Life is full with extraordinary challenges and unrivalled opportunities, but such chances must not be used against those, who parented you. With the birth of the children, the parents feel the paramount bliss of the Supreme Power and thank Him," the Court observed. The Bench of Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill also quoted from Guru Granth Sahib while stating that children should treat their parents as God "In the holy script of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Sri Guru Ram Dass has written 'KAAHAY POOT JHAGRAT HA-O SANG BAAP/ JIN KAY JANAY BADEERAY TUM HA-O TIN SIO JHAGRAT PAPP//" (O son, why do you argue with your father? It is a sin to argue with the one who fathered you and raised you). The above words of prudence guide us that we have to treat our parents as God," the Court said. The facts in brief The Court was hearing a criminal writ petition filed by the petitioners( son and his wife) seeking to to dismiss the application filed by respondent No.4 (father) under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, whereby the petitioners had been ordered to be ejected from the house in question. The application of the father was made to evict his son and daughter-in-law on the ground that the petitioners were not treating him and his wife properly and were depriving them even of the basic necessities and they also wanted to grab the property. On their application, Sub Divisional Magistrate, Thanesar noted that the father was the owner of the house and in his report, he recommended ejectment of the petitioners and sent the same to the office of the District Magistrate. Pursuant to this, DM, Kurukshetra via an order dated July 17, 2019, had ordered the ejectment of the petitioners from the house in question. It was claimed by the petitioners that the house in question was a joint Hindu family property and therefore, they couldn't have been evicted from the house in question and that he had contributed towards its renovation.  However, respondent number 4 (father) contended that the house in question is his self-acquired property, and rather it is not a joint Hindu family property. The  Court's observations Referring to Section 23 of the 2007 Act, the Court observed that this provision provides thus: "if a senior citizen who, after the commencement of the 2007 Act, has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, with the condition that the transferee would provide basic amenities and basic physical needs to the transferor, who thereafter refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, then the transfer of the property made by the senior citizen shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or under undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor, be declared void by the Tribunal." The Court further referred to the Act to conclude that there is a provision for eviction in the 2007 Act. Against this backdrop, the Court HELD thus: "Besides, the instant is not a case wherein any transfer or gift has been executed by respondent Nos.4 and 5 in favour of the petitioners. Thus, the petitioners cannot maintain their claim on the alleged ground that petitioner No.1 had contributed towards the renovation of the house." Thus, in view of the above discussion, the Court did not find any merit in the present petition and hence, the same was dismissed.  Read Order   
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently observed that the perversity of an action or decision by a public authority/official, acting in the domain of public administration, irrespective of the tier of the administration, has no hiding from the pendular gaze of the Rule of Law which may for a given case get late but not defaults in catching up with the wrong deed and wrongdoer masquerading in the domain of the public administration.  The observations were made by Justice Rahul Bharti while hearing a plea in terms of which the petitioner had challenged the engagement of respondent no. 6 as an Anganwadi Worker at the cost of the entitlement of the petitioner. In the instant matter the petitioner, who was supposed to be engaged as being at the number one position in the panel as an Anganwadi Worker had got duped of her said entitlement by contrivance on the part of the Sarpanch of the village to get his daughter-in-law to be engaged in which three government officials had lent their full role.   The engagement of respondent no. 6 as an Anganwadi Worker at the cost of the petitioner was sourced to an alleged affidavit dated November 24 2011 attributed to the petitioner and taken cognizance of by a three-member Selection Committee. It was on the basis of this document that the three-member Selection Committee had concluded that the petitioner will not work as an Anganwadi Worker and accordingly a way was paved for respondent no. 6 to get an engagement order.  In his plea the petitioner called the engagement of respondent no. 6 a foul play at the end of the official respondents concerned, engineered by respondent no. 7 to bring the undue and undeserving engagement of his daughter-in-law i.e. respondent no. 6 as an Anganwadi Worker for the Anganwadi Centre. Dealing with the matter Justice Bharti noted that the affidavit which proved to be a game changer in the matter bears a verification and attestation by and before the Tehsildar Executive Magistrate 1st Class, Sunderbani and incidentally it was the respondent no. 7 who had identified the petitioner.  After closely examining the Affidavit the bench observed that the court has no iota of doubt that the petitioner became the victim of foul play at the end of respondent no. 7 to which active and passive facilitation was extended by the three-member Selection Committee comprising of the officials of the time who served as the Child Development Project Officer ICDS Project Sunderbani, the District Social Welfare Officer Rajouri and the Programme Officer, ICDS Project Rajouri. Pointing out to the fact that the selection panel was prepared on Feb 06th 2012 and before that it was not in any manner possible for the petitioner, who is a middle-pass BPL category woman, to know beforehand in November 2011 that it is she who was going to be number one in merit, the court reasoned that the coming into picture of an affidavit dated November 24th 2011 allegedly attributed to the petitioner, even if the signatures of the petitioner on the said affidavit are genuine, cannot be said to be an act of the petitioner being conscious of the contents of the affidavit, its import and the effect and the purpose for which it was to be used. Highlighting the deception practised against the petitioner the court observed that what was known only to the three-member selection committee in terms of the final position of the candidates was already known to respondent no. 7 who activated his machination to play deception upon the petitioner as is evident from the very text of the affidavit itself in which the petitioner in November 2011 is assuming herself to be the number one candidate and tendering her abandonment in favour of the second candidate, which incidentally in terms of the merit list prepared on 06.02.2012 came to be the respondent no. 6. "It is in this context that the act of respondent no. 7 in identifying the petitioner concerning the attestation of the alleged affidavit of the petitioner before the Tesildar Executive Magistrate 1st Class, Sunderbani carries significance and is a pointer to the fact that respondent no. 7 was enjoying very active feedback of information from the end of the said three-member Selection Committee", the bench recorded. Expressing displeasure on the actions of the respondents the court observed that the connivance at the end of the members of the Selection Committee and respondent no. 7 was contrived and corrupt in nature and intent to deprive the petitioner of her merit-based entitlement and bestow wrongful gain in favour of respondent no. 6. "This Court cannot lend any legitimacy to this fraud and as such the engagement of the respondent no. 6 has to be held and is held to be null and void ab initio, and as such, is set aside", said the court. Additionally, the court directed the Anti Corruption bureau Bureau Rajouri to undertake an enquiry into the matter to ascertain the culpability, departmental or criminal, if any, official respondents who then constituted the Selection Committee and on the part of respondent no. 7. The bench further ordered the engagement of the petitioner as Anganwadi Worker with a further direction that the same shall be deemed to be with retrospective effect on a notional basis.

Observing that Islamic law recognises a Muslim woman's right to demand termination of marriage, the Kerala High Court has ruled that the will of the wife cannot be "related to the will of the husband" who may not be agreeing to the divorce. Dismissing a review petition against a judgment wherein the court had recognized a Muslim woman's right to resort to Khula, the division bench of Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque and Justice C. S. Dias said: "In the absence of any mechanism in the country to recognize the termination of marriage at the instance of the wife when the husband refuses to give consent, the court can simply hold that khula can be invoked without the conjunction of the husband" The court at the outset of the 59-page judgment said: This is a typical review portraying that Muslim women are subordinate to the will of their male counterparts. This review does not look innocuous at the instance of the appellant, but rather appears to have been fashioned and supported by clergies and the hegemonic masculinity of the Muslim community who are unable to digest the declaration of the right of Muslim women to resort to the extra-judicial divorce of khula, unilaterally. The appeal from which the review petition arose was filed challenging a divorce decree granted to a Muslim wife under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.  In the appeal, the court had declared that the right to terminate the marriage at the instance of a Muslim wife is an absolute right, conferred on her by the Holy Quran and is not subject to the acceptance or the will of her husband.  The court had said a Khula would be valid if certain conditions are met.  i. A declaration of repudiation or termination of marriage by the wife.ii. An offer to return dower or any other material gain received by her during marital tie.iii.An effective attempt for reconciliation was preceded before the declaration of khula.  In the review petition, it was argued that if a Muslim wife wishes to terminate her marriage with her husband, she has to demand talaq from her husband and on his refusal, she has to move the qazi or Court.  Though the petitioner conceded that a Muslim woman has the right to demand divorce of her own will, he also argued that she has "no absolute right" to pronounce khula. Nowhere in the world is a Muslim wife allowed to unilaterally terminate the marriage, it was contended. Understanding Meaning of Khula The Court in the judgement delivered last week said that Quranic verse found in Chapter 2, verse 229, relating to khula, in unequivocal terms, declares that a Muslim wife has the right to terminate her marriage. The bench noted the issue in the case before it arises in context of a reported Hadith, illustrating an instance of termination of marriage at the instance of a wife during the lifetime of the Prophet Mohammed.  Tracing back the evolution of the right of women to obtain a divorce from pre-islamic period onwards, the Court, relying on a research thesis, said the women exercised the authority to divorce unilaterally even during the per-Islamic period.  "In the post-Islamic period, Islam emphasised on conciliation as the preferred mode of resolution of all disputes between the believers. The believers, at the first instance, will have to resort to conciliation, before resorting to the authority given to them to terminate any sort of legal relationship," said the court.  Referring to the reported Hadith, the Court observed that the instances involved a conciliatory situation, and questioned whether procedure in itself can become law for effecting khula.  To answer the question, the court said one needs to distinguish between Hadith and Sunna - the former refers to the conduct of the prophet in a situation and latter refers to the law deduced from it.  "The procedure delineated and relied upon only refers to the settlement of a demand and the husband obliging thereon, by accepting return of the materials by pronouncing talaq, at the intervention of a third-party. That procedure adopted in a particular situation cannot itself be made a general law relating to khula while analyzing the right of the wife to obtain divorce. The general law has to be understood from the purport of the authority given and not with reference to the situation or circumstances under which it was exercised," added the court. It further observed that in Islamic law, it is desirable that all kinds of disputes are resolved amicably between believers, either themselves or with the assistance of the Ruler.  "If the matter is resolved by the Ruler or with the intervention of a third party, that procedure itself cannot be cited as the procedure for the determination and validity of the right conferred under the Quranic legislation. The right itself has to be understood from the scheme of the law," said the bench However, the Court clarified that it is not invalidating the procedure of arriving at a settlement between spouses on demand of the wife. The Court reiterated that the procedure is most desirable for parties. "However, we cannot hold that that procedure followed situationally, be treated as a law when parties are not able to arrive at such a settlement. If the procedure itself is understood as the law, that would derogate from the right conferred on a Muslim wife, under Quranic legislation, to terminate the marriage at her will."  The Court observed that the deduction of law from a particular conduct of the Prophet is not easy as the prophet acted in different and varied capacities, either in isolation or in a combination of those different capacities. The same has resulted in different understandings of Sunnah among Islamic scholars, the Court said, adding that as a result the difference has extended to beliefs and practices as well.  Woman Has Right To Terminate Marriage On Her Own A Muslim Scholar turned lawyer, Advocate Hussain C. S. contended that if the husband refuses to pronounce talaq on the request of the wife, a qadi has the power to pronounce talaq, and in the absence of a qadi, the modern Court can exercise the power of qadi. "A qadi cannot be equated with a Court in the modern State. Apparently, the reference to the qadi in this context is to exercise his authority as a guardian rather than an adjudicator. It is acknowledged by Islamic law that the Muslim wife has the right to demand termination of marriage. The argument that if the husband refuses, she has to move the Court stares at us," said the bench. The court added that when the woman moves the court in such a situation, it is neither called upon to adjudicate nor called upon to declare the status, but simply has to pronounce termination of marriage on behalf of the wife.  "The Court in our country is not a guardian of an adult and able woman. If there is nothing for a Court to adjudicate, the Court cannot assume the role of a guardian and pronounce termination of marriage at the instance of a woman. Conferring authority upon the court is an exercise in futility, inasmuch as the court cannot entertain the request as there is no dispute to be resolved between the parties. The relief of declaration of status based on divorce can be given only when divorce is effected through an extra judicial method," it observed. The Court further said that the very nature Khula has been recognised as a mode of divorce on a no-fault basis, and that is the reason why in the order under review, the Court interpreted that the residuary ground as referred under Section 2(ix) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 cannot be equated with khula.  "Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act only contemplates the dissolution of marriage at the instance of Muslim women on fault grounds," it added.  Observing that Sunnah cannot override or abrogate the primary legislation in Islamic law, the court further said:  If the Qur'an, in unequivocal terms, permits spouses to terminate their marriage on their own will, it cannot be said that the Sunnah further qualifies it, subjecting it to the will of the husband, in the case of khula  The Court, relying on the writings on Islamic Law, pointed out that the nature of Khula is in the form of a 'permissible' action to the Muslim wife who seeks to exercise the option of terminating her marriage.  This reflects the autonomy of choice exercised by the wife. The will of the wife so expressed cannot be related to the will of the husband who has not expressed his choice to terminate the marriage. The very idea of categorization under the law, of an action as permissible, is to retain that action within the domain of the person who exercises the option, by relating it with his or her autonomy. Extending such actions to the will of another would certainly keep the action out of the category of 'permissible'. The law being categorized so, it cannot be whittled down or constricted by the will of her husband upon whom no authority is conferred to enforce such permission. Furthermore, the court also recorded that the review petitioner has admitted that neither Quran nor Sunnah provides any guidance in the event the husband refuses to pronounce talaq, and in such a situation. Islam itself has provided the guidance to overcome situation like this where a legal vacuum is created, the bench added. The court said the Muslim women in India are confronted with a situation where no solution would be available to them to effectuate this right, conferred on her by Quran, if the arguments of the review petitioner are accepted.  "In the absence of any other method in the manner suggested by the counsel for the review petitioner and others,to effectuate the right conferred on Muslim women being prevalent in this country, the Court's authority in conferring upon Muslim women the right to invoke khula at her own will, will have to be respected," the court added. The Court found no reason to review the judgment and, thereby, dismissed the revision petition.  Advocates Babu Karukapadath, P. U. Vinod Kumar, Arya Raghunath, Vaisakhi V, T.M.

The Madras High Court recently directed the Thoothukudi District Collector and police authorities to strictly implement a Circular Memorandum regarding procedure to be followed while granting permission to conduct cultural events, sports events, procession/meeting etc. The authorities were thus to ensure that no obscene or vulgar dance performance or other procession takes place during the Dasara festival in the Arultharum Mutharamman temple.  We direct that the obscene and vulgar dance performance should be specifically prohibited by the Police authorities in the forthcoming festival and if any one violates the same, appropriate action shall be taken against them in line with the above said Circular Memorandum.   The bench of Justice R Mahadevan and Justice Sathya Narayana Prasad were hearing a petition filed by one Ramkumar Adityan to direct the police authorities to obtain a declaration from the organisers of all Dasara Groups and Sound Hire Service Providers not to sing and play any non Devotional Songs and Kuthu Pattu during Dasara festival in connection to the festival of Arultharum Mutharamman Thirukovil, Kulasekarapattinam, Thoothukudi District. By doing so, the petitioner sought to stop vulgar and obscene dance performances in the name of Dasara Groups and to protect the Traditional Culture, Traditional Viradham System and Religious sentiments of lakhs of Devotees.   The petitioner submitted that though initially the Dasara Festival was associated with processions and folk music and dance, now these Dasara groups started hiring cine/television actors who without observing any virudham would perform obscene and vulgar dance performances.   The court perused through the photographs produced by the petitioner and was convinced that the same made a mockery of the traditional culture.   While photographs from page Nos.22 to 27 relating to Dasara celebration in other places in India show traditional culture and customs, photographs from pages 28 to 37 relating to devotees who are observing viradham and watching dances at Kulasekaranpatinam Dasara celebration, conspicuously show that such dances are performed by paid dancers exhibiting obscene and vulgar postures making mockery of the traditional culture and customs to be followed in Dasara festival and denigrating the Hindu religious sentiments.  The Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that pursuant to the orders of the court, the Director General of Police had issued a circular memorandum in 2018 to all Commissioners of Police in Cities and all the Superintendent of Police in Districts, instructing them to ensure compliance with the orders of the court.  The Inspectors were further directed to obtain an undertaking from the organisers that there will not be any obscenity or vulgarity in the cultural programs or any disturbance to the public peace and tranquility. In case any violation was noticed, the authorities were directed to take stringent/criminal action against those concerned.  Later, in 2019 another circular was issued with consolidated instructions with regard to the procedures to be followed while granting permission to conduct cultural events,sports events, procession/meeting etc. The AAG assured the court that these circulars will be followed in letter and spirit during the current Dasara festival also.   In view of such submission by the AAG, the court disposed of the petition directing the authorities to strictly follow the memorandum and the directives of the court.

The High Court of Delhi held that the arbitrator cannot re-write the terms of the agreement between the parties merely because they flout business common sense.  The Single Bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru has held that an award wherein the arbitrator re-work a bargain between the parties merely because it is commercially difficult for one party to perform the same would be against the fundamental policy of Indian Law and vitiated by patent illegality.   The Court held that when the agreement confers on one party the right to place an additional order on the same terms and conditions during the currency of the contract, the condition under the agreement must be given effect to and the arbitrator cannot negate the mandate of such a stipulation.   Facts  The Ministry of Railways (petitioner) invited tenders for the manufacture and supply of certain wagons. JIRL (respondent) submitted its bid and was declared the lowest bidder. Accordingly, the petitioner issued a Letter of Acceptance (LoA) to the respondent for the supply of wagons.   Thereafter, the parties entered into the contract (agreement) and the petitioner issued an order for supply of 1871 wagons. The supply was to be made in two transactions.   The agreement had an Optional Clause (Clause 2.8) which conferred on the petitioner the right to increase/decrease the ordered quantity up to 30% of the ordered quantity during the currency of the Agreement, on the same price and terms and conditions, with a suitable extension in the delivery period for the optional quantity. Certain amendments were incorporated into the agreement.   Thereafter, the petitioner awarded a contract for supply of 1075 wagons to L-2 tenderer at the rates quoted by the said tenderer. Aggrieved by the dual pricing followed by the petitioner, the respondent raised its grievance with the petitioner and sought parity of treatment and fixation of uniform pricing for the wagons.   In the meantime, the third amendment was made to the agreement and the petitioner exercised its right to place an order for additional quantity at the same price. Thereafter, the respondent was awarded another contract for supply and manufacture of 292 BOXNHL wagons at a much higher price.   The respondent again requested the petitioner to agree to its demand and increase the price of the wagon under the additional order. On receiving no positive response, the respondent invoked the arbitration clause for the adjudication of its claims qua the dual pricing of wagons. The respondent nominated its executive director, however, the respondent did not concur with the nominated appointed and filed a petition under Section 11 of the A&C Act which was allowed by the Court.   The Award  The respondent raised certain claims before the arbitrator. The respondent contested the claims without raising any counter-claims. The arbitrator rejected the claims of the respondent, however, it held that the petitioner had no right to issue the third amendment vide which it had placed additional orders on the respondent.   The arbitrator held the additional order to be in breach of the terms of the agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal held that the costs of manufacture of wagons and market price for supply of wagons had gone up substantially and, the Railways could not have ordered additional quantity at the same price. The arbitrator held that the petitioner could not place the additional order when the cost of manufacture was more than the price of the wagon.   The Arbitral Tribunal held that the parties could not have intended for the Railways to exercise an option of increasing the quantity if the price in the market or the cost of production had increased substantially, rendering it commercially unviable to manufacture and supply the said wagons.  The arbitrator held that in terms of Section 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act, the petitioner is liable to compensate the respondent for the damage caused to it on account of supply of additional wagons at a price lower than the cost of the manufacturing.   The Grounds Of Challenge  The petitioner challenged the award on the following grounds:  The arbitrator has ignored the express terms of the agreement between the parties. The arbitrator has re-written the terms of the agreement between the parties and re-worked a bargain reached between the parties. In terms of Clause 2.8 of the agreement, the petitioner was well within its right to either reduce or increase the quantity of the wagons, therefore, the third amendment and the additional order were expressly in terms of the agreement. The respondent had unconditionally accepted the third amendment and the additional order. The respondent did not challenge the validity of Clause 2.8, therefore, it was not open for the arbitrator to give a finding on such an issue. The respondent had raised an issue qua the dual pricing only and when the same was rejected by the arbitrator, the award was beyond the claims made by respondent.   Analysis By The Court  The Court observed that the award is based on the reasoning that the terms of the contract could not be literally interpreted if it "flouts business common sense".   The Court held that in terms of paragraph 9 of the LoA and Clause 2.8 of the agreement, the petitioner retained the right to increase or decrease the ordered quantity up to 30% during the currency of the Agreement, therefore, it was not open for the arbitrator to interpret the clause in such a manner to deprive the petitioner of its right under the said clause.   The Court held that the arbitrator held the additional order to be not within the terms of the agreement on the presumption that the price of the wagon had substantially gone up, however, it was never the case of the respondent that the petitioner could not place an additional order.   The Court held that when the agreement confers on one party the right to place an additional order on the same terms and conditions during the currency of the contract, the condition under the agreement must be given effect to and the arbitrator cannot negate the mandate of such a stipulation.   It further held that a commercial contract between the parties cannot be sidestepped on the ground that one of the parties subsequently finds it commercially unviable to perform the same.  The Court held that the petitioner placed the additional orders purely in terms of the agreement and on the price originally offered by the respondent.   The Court held that by interpretation adopted by the arbitrator is not a plausible one. The Court held that the arbitrator cannot ignore the plain mandate of a term in the agreement merely because it flouts the business common sense.   The Court held that it is not open for the Arbitral Tribunal to examine the commercial wisdom of a party and rewrite the Agreement on the basis of the commercial difficulties it would face in performing the obligations.   The Court further observed that "it is not necessary that all contracts yield a profit; some result in a loss as well. This is not a factor to permit a party to avoid its contractual obligations."  According, the Court set aside the award on the ground that it is against the fundamental policy of Indian law and vitiated by patent illegality.

It may be noted that the earlier bail plea of the applicant accused was dismissed in September 2021 on the basis of his criminal record (as recorded in the Case diary). However, when the case dairy again came before the Court (in the instant plea), then at that point of time, no criminal history was reflected in the diary. In view of this, the Court called for an affidavit of SHO, Police Station Physical, Shivpuri asking him as to whether the accused has any criminal history or not. Pursuant to the Order of the Court, the SHO, Police Station filed an affidavit and said that a wireless message regarding no criminal history of the applicant was sent by Constable, Karera and the same was recorded by him in the case diary. It was further submitted that since the concerned Constable did not state the correct facts and on wireless reply referred the fact that applicant does not bear any criminal record, therefore, believing the same, SHO, Police Station referred the fact about the applicant as a man of no criminal background.  Lastly, the SHO, Police Station Physical tendered an apology for his mistake and submitted that next time he will improve upon the system and would not repeat the lapse in the future. In view of this, the Court, Granting him bail, noted that the accused had been suffering confinement since June 2021 had a criminal record for minor offences therefore, a chance could be given to him to reform himself and for course correction. Allowing the application, it was directed that he shall be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac Only) with two solvent sureties each of Rs.50,000/- of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court concerned. However, the Superintendent of Police, Shivpuri was directed to take note of the situation and issue necessary directions to all the police stations about the prompt and fair response in respect of case dairy and criminal record, if any, of accused who is seeking bail. The Court also directed for an inquiry against the Constable- Lokendra Singh-Batch No.660, Police Station Karera and thereafter, ensure appropriate action if any officer including the constable is found guilty of the misconduct.

Children being minors are to be protected. In this context, the Suo Moto power is conferred on the Commission to initiate action, the court observed.Madras High Court has refused to quash a summons issued by the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights on alleged child rights violations in the schools run by Isha Yoga Centre at Velliangiri, Coimbatore. Justice S.M. Subramaniam observed that mere issuance of summon by the Commission under the provisions of the Act would not provide cause for the petitioner to institute... Madras High Court has refused to quash a summons issued by the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights on alleged child rights violations in the schools run by Isha Yoga Centre at Velliangiri, Coimbatore.  Justice S.M. Subramaniam observed that mere issuance of summon by the Commission under the provisions of the Act would not provide cause for the petitioner to institute the present writ petition. It noted that such a writ petition would stand only if the summons was issued by an authority not competent nor possessing the jurisdiction to do. Else, the petitioner must show that the summons was issued with malafides and establish that there have been no violations, by filing their objections.  On the suo moto complaint registered by the Commission under Section 14 (1) of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, the court stated:  "The Suo-Moto powers conferred on the Commission is to ensure that the educational institutions function under the recognized scheme of education pattern and in the event of any violation or infringement of the rights of children, then actions are imminent and therefore, mere issuance of summon by the Commission under the provisions of the Act would not provide cause for the petitioner to institute the present writ petition."  The court added that Isha Yoga Centre shouldn't have opted to approach the High Court at the enquiry stage itself for quashing the summons issued by the Commission. Rather, Isha Yoga Centre could have defended the allegations against them before the Commission itself and established their case.  The counsel for the petitioner argued that the Commission had predetermined the issues at the preliminary stage itself and it was reluctant to hear the submissions of Isha Foundation with an open mind.  The court accordingly ordered the Commission to provide the petitioner with the opportunity to be heard and conduct the enquiry in a free and fair manner:  "The respondent is directed to issue fresh summons to the petitioner, fixing date and time, enabling the writ petitioner to appear and submit their explanations / objections along with documents, if any, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order…"  Isha Yoga Centre should also submit its objections within one week of receiving the summons from the Commission pursuant to court order. Further, the Commission has been asked by the court to dispose off the proceedings within eight weeks of issuance of summons.  Accordingly, the writ petition was disposed off.  Background  According to the petitioner, Isha Foundation has Saddhguru Jaggi Vasudev at its helm, and it runs schools in rural areas. It has also adopted several government schools under its School Adoption Programme. The counsel A.M Amrutha Ganesh further submitted that it imparts Vedic knowledge by following the Gurukula System of education. The administrator had approached the Commission with relevant documents on the day specified in Summons but the petitioner was not heard owing to delays, submitted the counsel.  The respondent counsel for the state, Advocate C. Jaya Prakash, contended that the Commission is free to conduct an enquiry whenever it deems fit and the Foundation is required to submit their defence as per the law.  In the present case, Summons was issued by the Commission back in September 2016. The Commission had cited violations of Section 13(1)(j),(k) of the Act which deals with initiation of enquiry and suo moto notice for deprivation of child rights, non-implementation of laws for protection and development of children and non-compliance with policy decisions/guidelines etc.  Case Title: Administrator, Isha Yoga Centre v. Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights  Case No: W.P.No.35102 of 2016 & W.M.P.No.30255 of 2016    
While allowing the development works carried by Odisha Government near the historic Puri Jagannath Temple, the Supreme Court held that construction of essential facilities like toilets, water supply etc., are permissible within the prohibited area near a protected monument. The Court held that the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act(AMASR Act), 1958 does not absolutely bar such construction activities within the 100 meter prohibited area from a protected monument(Ardhendu Kumar Das vs State of Odisha). According to Section 20A of the Act, area within the radius of 100 meters from the protected monument is declared as "prohibited area". As per Section 20A(3), the Central Government or Director General can permit public works essential for public interest in prohibited area. Section 20A(4) states that no permission, referred to in sub­ section (3), including carrying out any public work or project essential to the public or other constructions, shall be granted in any prohibited area after the date on which the 2010 Amendment to the AMASR Act received Presidential assent. Relying on Section 20A(4), the petitioners argued that the construction of toilets etc by the State Government in the prohibited area of Jagannath Temple premises was illegal. The Advocate General of Odisha argued that works like construction of toilets, drainages etc., are exempted from the definition of "construction" under Section 2(dc) of the Act. The bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and Hima Kohli noted that the definition of "construction" specifically excludes the following: (i) Re­construction, repair and renovation of an existing structure or building; (ii) Construction, maintenance and cleansing of drains and drainage works and of public latrines, urinals and similar conveniences; (iii) Construction and maintenance of works meant for providing supply of water for public; and (iv) Construction or maintenance, extension, management for supply and distribution of electricity to the public or provision for similar facilities for public. The bench also noted that Sections 20C and 20D of the Act permits construction, repair, renovation etc in the prohibited area with the permission of the authority. In the instant case, the National Monument Authority has given permission for the construction activities. The Court said that though the argument of the petitioner by relying on Section 20A(4) is attractive in first blush, the provision has to be read harmoniously with other provisions. "At first blush, the arguments of the appellants on the basis of sub­section (4) of Section 20A of the said Act may appear to be attractive. But when sub­section (4) of Section 20A of the said Act is read in harmony with clause (dc) of Section 2 and the provisions of Sections 20C and 20D of the said Act, we find that the submission that no construction at all can be made in the prohibited area or the regulated area, would be unsustainable". "Firstly, it is to be noted that clause (dc) of Section 2 of the said Act itself excludes four categories as mentioned hereinabove from the definition of "construction". The legislative intent is thus clear that the four categories which are excluded from the definition of "construction" as defined in clause (dc) of Section 2 of the said Act would not be treated as a "construction", wherever the said term is referred to in the statute. The legislative intent is clear that the re­construction,repair, renovation of the existing buildings has been excluded from the definition. Similarly, the construction, maintenance etc. of drains, drainage works, public latrines and urinals; the construction and maintenance of works meant for providing supply of water to public; and construction etc. for distribution of electricity, which could be construed to be essential services for catering to the needs of the public at large, have consciously been kept out of the definition of "construction". It could be presumed that the legislature was aware that repairs and reconstruction of existing structures or buildings or construction of essential facilities like public latrines, urinals, water supply and electricity distribution for the pilgrims/residents are basic necessities and as such, should be permitted even in the prohibited area. If it is not so interpreted, then Section 20C of the said Act would be rendered otiose and redundant. It need not be emphasized that an interpretation which leads a particular provision to be otiose or redundant or meaningless, has to be avoided".  Also, the need for toilets in the area was taken note of by the Supreme Court in the case Mrinalini Padhi vs. Union of India and others in which detailed directions were issued for the administration of the Jahgannath Temple. In that case, the Court had emphasized on the necessity to have separate toilets for male and female. The Court further directed that the toilets be provided with modern amenities and should be kept absolutely clean. The Court also directed that the number of toilets shall be adequate having regard to the average footfall in the Temple. In this backdrop, the bench observed : "The construction is being carried out for the purpose of providing basic and essential amenities like toilets for men and women, cloak rooms, electricity rooms etc. These are the basic facilities which are necessary for the convenience of the devotees at large. As already discussed hereinabove, the legislative intent appears to be clear. The legislature has deliberately excluded four categories from the definition of "construction". The purpose behind it appears to be that the repairs and renovation of the buildings, which are existing and the constructions which are necessary for providing basic facilities like drainage, toilets, water supply and distribution of electricity should be kept out of the rigour of requirement of statutory permissions:" The petitioner raised an argument that such permission can be given only to an individual residing in the area for construction or renovation of an existing structure and not for the State to provide facilities for the public. The bench rejected this argument as : "If an individual person can construct a toilet in a prohibited area; can the State be denied to do so, when the State finds it necessary to do it in the larger public interest for providing basic facilities to the lakhs of devotees visiting the shrine? The answer is an emphatic 'no'". Case Title : Ardhendu Kumar Das vs State of Odisha Head notes Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 - Sections 20A, 20C, 20D -The repairs and renovation of the buildings, which are existing and the constructions which are necessary for providing basic facilities like drainage, toilets, water supply and distribution of electricity are kept out of the rigour of requirement of statutory permissions - Para 51 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 - Sections 20A, 20C, 20D -When sub­section (4) of Section 20A of the said Act is read in harmony with clause (dc) of Section 2 and the provisions of Sections 20C and 20D of the said Act, we find that the submission that no construction at all can be made in the prohibited area or the regulated area, would be unsustainable.(Para 41) Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 - Section 2(dc)- Definition of "Construction" - The legislative intent is clear that the re­construction,repair, renovation of the existing buildings has been excluded from the definition. Similarly, the construction, maintenance etc. of drains, drainage works, public latrines and urinals; the construction and maintenance of works meant for providing supply of water to public; and construction etc. for distribution of electricity, which could be construed to be essential services for catering to the needs of the public at large, have consciously been kept out of the definition of "construction" (Para 41, 42) Interpretation of Statutes - It is a settled principle of law that all the provisions in the statute have to be read harmoniously. It is presumed that each and every provision has been brought by the legislature into the statute book with some purpose. A particular provision cannot be read in isolation and has to be read in context to each other. An attempt has to be made to reconcile all the provisions of the statute together, unless it is impossible (Para 40) Public Interest Litigation - Frivolous PILs should be nipped in the bud - In the recent past, it is noticed that there is mushroom growth of public interest litigations. However, in many of such petitions, there is no public interest involved at all. The petitions are either publicity interest litigations or personal interest litigation. We highly deprecate practice of filing such frivolous petitions. They are nothing but abuse of process of law. They encroach upon a valuable judicial time which could be otherwise utilized for considering genuine issues. It is high time that such so­called public interest litigations are nipped in the bud so that the developmental activities in the larger public interest are not stalled (Para 59)      
The Delhi High Court has discussed in detail the guidelines that must be borne in mind by the courts while adjudicating the question as to whether an authority can be termed as a "State" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the control exercised by the State over an authority should be pervasive in nature to the extent that the authority should have limited autonomy.  "It must not be lost sight of that in the modern concept of Welfare State, independent institution, corporation and agency are generally subject to State control. The State control does not render such bodies as 'State' under Article 12. The State control, however vast and pervasive, is not determinative. The financial contribution by the State is also not conclusive," the court held.  It also observed the combination of State aid along with an "unusual degree of control" over an authority's management and policies thereby rendering of an important public service, may also reflect that the said body is a State.  "If the government operates behind a corporate veil, carrying out governmental activity and governmental functions of vital public importance, there may be little difficulty in identifying the body as "State" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution," the court said. Emphasising that there is no clear-cut formula for deciding if an authority is a State or not, the court said that the powers, functions, finances and control of the government are some of the indicating factors to answer the question. "With regard to this, each case must be handled with care and caution. Where the financial assistance from the State is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the institution, or the share capital of the corporation is completely held by the government, then one could agree with an entity being bestowed with government character. It may be a relevant factor if the institution or the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State conferred or State protected," the court said.  The bench also said that other factors to adjudicate if an authority is a State may include the existence of a deep and pervasive State control and if the functions of the institution are of public importance, relating to governmental functions.  These are merely indicative indicia and are by no means conclusive or clinching in any case, the bench added while relying on various Supreme Court rulings. The bench made the observations while dismissing an appeal challenging the order of the single judge which had ruled thar Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) does not fall within the ambit of State under Article 12 of the Constitution of India.  Upholding the impugned order, the division bench said that the function performed by the GJEPC cannot be termed as a public duty.  Taking note of the Articles of Association and Memorandum of Association of GJEPC, the court observed that the council's primary function is to support, protect, maintain and promote the export of gems and jewellery and to act as a Nodal Agency between the exporters and the Government.  "The Council being a collective body of the exporters places the interests/problems faced by the exporters before the Government so that the Government can take such decisions which would promote the export of gems and jewellery. The Council, therefore, does not carry out the policy decisions of the Government or is in any way relevant to the decision-making process of the Government regarding exports of these articles," the court said.  The court also observed that the funds provided by the Centre to GJEPC are solely for execution of specific schemes and projects, adding that it is the Central Government's prerogative to ensure that the said funds are not misused. It added that merely because the Central Government may also inspect the books and accounts of GJPEC does not establish that it controls the council's financial aspects.  "In view of the above observations, this Court is of the opinion that the learned Single Judge vide the impugned Judgement dated 09.07.2021 in W.P.(C) No. 4733/2021, wherein it held that the writ petition would not be maintainable as the GJEPC, i.e. Respondent No.2 does not fall within the ambit of "State" and "other authorities" under Article 12 of the Constitution of India, is legally firm and does not require any interference on the part of this Court," the court said.  Title: DR JITARANI UDGATA v. UNION OF INDIA & ANR.    
The Karnataka High Court recently upheld a family court order which directed the mother of a seven years old girl child to hand over the custody to child's father, after observing that she herself was more attentive towards her illicit relationship at work rather than welfare of her child. A division bench of Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice S Vishwajith Shetty dismissed the appeal filed by the woman and observed, "If the issue regarding the relationship of the appellant with the said S (name redacted) juxtaposition the welfare of the child is considered, it appears that the appellant has given more importance to the illicit relationship of hers with the said S (name redacted) and has neglected the child...she had handed over custody of the child to her parents who were residing at Panchakul in Chandigarh while she continued to stay at Bengaluru with S (name redacted)." It added, "the Courts are not only required to consider the comforts and attachments of the child but should also take into consideration the surroundings in which the child is growing, the moral and ethical values which the child learns by observation, availability of care and affection when the child needs it most and thereafter strike a balance which would be more beneficial for the child's welfare and interest." The family court had allowed a petition filed by the child's father under Section 25 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 Act.  In appeal, the mother argued that she and the child were "thrown out" of the matrimonial home but the child is now growing in a good atmosphere and pursuing her studies. Moreover, she argued that there is nobody to take care of the girl child in the house of the respondent whereas she herself is a doctor having good income and she is capable of taking care of the child. The respondent-father on the other hand contended that the appellant developed an illicit relationship at work in 2016, a year after the child's birth. She used to be away with her parmour during weekends while he and his parents with the help of a housemaid took care of the child. Thereafter, she left the matrimonial house along with the child in 2018. He claimed that the child was growing in a "unholy atmosphere" in the midst of an illicit relationship between the appellant and her paramour, apprehending that the welfare of the child and its future was not safe. At the outset, the High Court observed that the respondent-father successfully proved that the relationship of the appellant with S (name redacted) was beyond business meetings. “If the meetings were in relation to any business transaction, they were required to be held in the coffee shop or in the lobby of the hotel or in a meeting room. However, Ex.P-15 document clearly shows that the appellant and the said S (name redacted) had checked into the hotel room and they had stayed in the room on certain occasions even overnight.”  It expressed that though in normal circumstances, the wish/desire of the child would also play a prominent role while deciding the custody of the said child. However, having regard to the material on record and the fact that the child was throughout kept away from the father and was being tutored by the appellant mother, Court said no purpose would be served by ascertaining from the child its desire or wish.  “Desire and wish of a child can be ascertained only if the child is mature enough to form an intelligent preference and judgment, otherwise, it is for the court to analyse the material and make a decision taking into consideration the paramount interest of the child,” it added.  The Court continued, “When the child is deprived of a proper parenthood, its overall growth and happiness gets effected and in such situation, the Courts are not only required to consider the comforts and attachments of the child but should also take into consideration the surroundings in which the child is growing, the moral and ethical values which the child learns by observation, availability of care and affection when the child needs it most and thereafter strike a balance which would be more beneficial for the child's welfare and interest.”  Further noting that the appellant had filed cases against the husband after leaving his house, the bench said, “All these aspects would clearly go to show the attitude and hostility of the appellant towards the respondent, in spite of she continuing her illicit relationship with the aforesaid S (name redacted) after leaving the matrimonial house.”  Further the bench said the woman had not honoured several orders of the court providing visitation rights to the respondent and she had successfully kept the child away from the respondent.  The court also junked the contention of the woman that since respondent has not produced the necessary certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the photographs of the appellant in the company of her paramour relied on by him cannot be accepted as evidence.  It said “In view of Section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, the Family Court is authorised or empowered to receive as evidence any report, statement, documents, information if any, in its opinion, the same would assist it to deal effectually with a dispute, irrespective of whether it is relevant or admissible under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.”  Further noting that the woman had after leaving the matrimonial house handed over the custody of the child to her parents in Chandigarh the bench said “Therefore, it is very clear that prior to the appellant leaving her matrimonial house as well as after she left the matrimonial house, she had not taken care of the child and it was the respondent and his parents who were taking care of the child while she was staying from the matrimonial home.”  Accordingly, the Court upheld the family court order. It also granted visitation rights to the mother and said, “We feel that the interest of the minor child will be best served if the custody of the child is handed over to the respondent, but with sufficient access to the appellant to visit the minor at frequent intervals.” Thus it laid down certain situational criteria for the couple to follow.

The Kerala High Court recently reiterated that the Kerala State Human Rights Commission has no jurisdiction to entertain service matters.  The Division Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Murali Purushothaman relied upon the decisions in Malabar Cements Ltd. (M/s.) v. K. Baburajan & Ors. (2019), and District Tourism Promotion Council, represented by its Secretary v. State of Kerala represented by the Secretary & Ors. (2021), both of which had held that, in terms of Regulation 17(f) of the Kerala State Human Rights Commission (Procedure) Regulations, 2001, the Commission may dismiss in limine a complaint, if the issue pertains to service matters.  As per the factual matrix, the 2nd respondent had filed a petition before the SHRC seeking revision of pay of guest lecturers of IHRD College. Subsequently, the Commission passed an interim order dated November 30, 2018, directing the Director, IHRD (petitioner herein), to take steps to grant the revised salary notified by the Government as per the recommendation of the 10th Pay Commission to the IHRD workers and guest lecturers.  It is challenging the said interim order that the present writ petition had been filed by the petitioner.  The petitioner, represented by Advocate Deepu Thankan, submitted that as per Regulation 17(f), it has been clearly stipulated that issues pertaining to civil dispute, service matter, labour or industrial disputes are not maintainable before the Kerala State Human Rights Commission, and the Commission ought not to have considered the complaint at the very first instance. It was pointed out that Regulation 38 vests the Commission with the power of summons, however, in the instant case, the Commission had passed the impugned order without hearing the petitioner or any other concerned authority. Additionally, it was argued that the Commission, while passing the impugned order, also failed to understand the fact that the benefits under the 10th Pay Commission could not be granted to the employees and guest lectures of the petitioner's institutions with immediate effect, since the State Government had not even taken a decision for implementation of the benefits under the 10th Pay Commission in the petitioner's institutions. "Moreover, the benefits under the 9th Pay Revision has also not yet completely implemented in the petitioner’s institution due to lack of funds. These aspects were not considered by the Human Rights Commission," the counsel argued.  It is in this context that the Court referred to the aforementioned decisions in Malabar Cements Ltd. (2019), and District Tourism Promotion Council (2021), to ascertain that the Commission may dismiss complaints pertaining to service matters in limine.  "That apart, reading of the order dated 30.11.2018 indicates that by way of the interim order, the main relief sought for in the complaint has been issued. Notwithstanding the jurisdiction of Kerala State Human Rights Commission in entertaining a complaint, it is well settled that interim order should not be issued in the guise of the main relief itself," the Court added.  It thus set aside the impugned order of the SHRC on these grounds.  Case Title: The Institute of Human Resources Development (IHRD) v. Kerala State Human Rights Commission & Anr.   
Reversing the judgment of the Calcutta High Court, the Supreme Court on Friday upheld the constitutional validity of clause (f) of Section 43B of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Calcutta High Court vide order dated 27.06.2007 in APO No. 301 of 2005, had held that the said clause is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Clause (f)... Reversing the judgment of the Calcutta High Court, the Supreme Court on Friday upheld the constitutional validity of clause (f) of Section 43B of the Income Tax Act, 1961.        The Calcutta High Court vide order dated 27.06.2007 in APO No. 301 of 2005, had held that the said clause is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.        Clause (f) was inserted in the already existing Section 43B vide Finance Act, 2001 with effect from 1.4.2002. The purpose of introducing this clause was to provide for a tax disincentive in cases of deductions claimed by the assessee from income tax in lieu of liability accrued under the leave encashment scheme but not actually discharged by the employer.    Actual payment of liability to the employees was made a condition precedent, by this clause, for extending the benefit of deduction under the 1961 Act. This means that with the application of clause (f), the eligibility for deduction arises in the previous year in which the above said payment is actually made and not in which provision was made in that regard.        The respondents, aggrieved by the inclusion of the clause (f) contended that :    Section 145 of the 1961 Act offers them the choice of method of accounting and accordingly, they computed their profits and gains of business in accordance with the mercantile system;  Section 43B has been carved out as an exception to the afore stated general rule of accrual for determination of liability, as it subjects deductions in lieu of certain kinds of liabilities to actual payment; Exception under Section 43B comes into operation only in a limited set of cases covering statutory liabilities like tax, duty, cess etc. and other liabilities created for the welfare of employees; andTherefore, the liability under the leave encashment scheme being a trading liability cannot be subjected to the exception under Section 43B of the 1961 Act.       The approach adopted by the Apex Court in testing the constitutional validity of a provision was well settled and the fundamental concern of the Court was to inspect the existence of enacting power and once such power was found to be present, the next examination was to ascertain whether the enacted provision impinges upon any right enshrined in Part III of the Constitution or not.        The Bench noted that the legislative power of the Parliament to enact clause (f) in the light of Article 245 is not doubted at all.        "That brings us to the next step of examination i.e. whether the said clause contravenes any right enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, either in its form, substance or effect. It is no more res integra that the examination of the Court begins with a presumption in favour of constitutionality. This presumption is not just borne out of judicial discipline and prudence, but also out of the basic scheme of the Constitution wherein the power to legislate is the exclusive domain of the Legislature/Parliament." observed the Bench. The Justices explained that this power to legislate is clothed with power to decide 'when to legislate, what to legislate and how much to legislate.'       The Bench further explained that the function of deciding the timing, content and extent of legislation has been primarily entrusted to the Legislature, and the Court, while exercising judicial review, starts with a basic presumption in favour of the proper exercise of such power.        "Sub section (1) of Section 145 explicitly provides that the method of accounting is a prerogative falling in the domain of the assessee and an assessee is well within its rights to follow the mercantile system of accounting. Be that as it may, it is noteworthy that the right flowing from sub section (1) is "subject to the provisions of sub section (2)", which unambiguously empowers the Central Government to prescribe income computation and disclosure standards for accounting. Concededly, sub section (2) is an enabling provision. It signifies that the general principle of autonomy of the assessee in adopting a system of accounting, is controlled by the regulation notified by the Central Government and must be adhered to by the class of assessee governed thereunder." noted the Bench.            The Justices stated that Section 43B is enacted to provide for deductions to be availed by the assessee in lieu of liabilities accruing in previous year without making actual payment to discharge the same and it is not a provision to place any embargo upon the autonomy of the assessee in adopting a particular method of accounting, nor does it deprive the assessee of any lawful deduction.        Elaborating, the Bench said that the clause merely operates as an additional condition for the availment of deduction qua the speicfied head. Section 43B opens with a non obstante clause, and thus, assumes an overriding character against any other provision of general application.        "Out of the allowable deductions, the legislature consciously earmarked certain deductions from time to time and included them in the ambit of Section 43B so as to subject such deductions to conditionality of actual payment. Such conditionality may have the inevitable effect of being different from the theme of mercantile system of accounting on accrual of liability basis qua the specific head of deduction covered therein and not to other heads. But that is a matter for the legislature and its wisdom in doing so." observed the Bench.        The Court while tracing the developments in Section 43B stated that Section 43B is a mixed bag, there is no oneness or uniformity in 18 the nature of deductions included in it and it holds no merit to urge that this section only provides for deduction concerning statutory liabilities.    'New and dissimilar entries have been inserted therein from time to time to cater to different fiscal scenarios, which are best determined by the government of the day.' added the Bench.        The Justices explained that clause (f) seeks to mitigate a mischief i.e. the absence of this clause would entail in a double benefit to the employer- advance deduction from tax liability without any burden of actual payment and refusal to pay as and when occasion arises.       The Court then noted that the respondents' challenge to the constitutional validity of the said clause has primarily been accepted on three grounds:    (i) Non disclosure of objects and reasons behind its enactment and insertion into section 43B; (ii) Inconsistency of clause (f) with other clauses of Section 43B and absence of nexus of the clause with the original enactment;     (iii) Enactment has been triggered solely to nullify the dicta of this Court in Bharat Earth Movers        Non disclosure of objects and reasons The Justices declared that to hold a provision as violative of the Constitution on account of failure of the legislature to state the objects and reasons would amount to an indirect scrutiny of the motives of the legislature behind the enactment. "Such a course of action, in our view, is unwarranted. The raison d'etre behind this self imposed restriction is because of the fundamental reason that different organs of the State do not scrutinise each other's wisdom in the exercise of their duties. In other words, the timetested principle of checks and balances does not empower the Court to question the motives or wisdom of the legislature, except in circumstances when the same is demonstrated from the enacted law." declared the Court.   The Bench also noted that that the High Court reaches this conclusion without undertaking an actual examination of clause (f). Instead, the declaration was preceded by an enquiry into the circumstances leading upto the enactment.    The Bench iterrated that the constitutional power of judicial review contemplates a review of the provision, as it stands, and not a review of the circumstances in which the enactment was made.        Inconsistency of clause (f) and absence of nexus with Section 43B Declaring that both the grounds are illfounded, the Court observed that in the basic scheme of Section 43B, there is no direct or indirect limitation upon the power of legislature to include only particular type of deductions in the ambit of Section 43B.       "To say that Section 43B is restricted to deductions of a statutory nature 30 would be nothing short of reading the provision in a purely imaginative manner....... that the legislature never restricted it to a particular category of deduction and that intent cannot be read into the main Section by the Court, while sitting in judicial review." remarked the Bench.        The Justices further noted that the broad objective of enacting Section 43B concerning specified deductions referred to therein was to protect larger public interest primarily of revenue including welfare of the employees and Clause (f) fits into that scheme and shares sufficient nexus with the broad objective.       The Bench also noted that the approach of constitutional courts ought to be different while dealing with fiscal statute, it is trite that the legislature is the best forum to weigh different problems in the fiscal domain and form policies to address the same including to create a new liability, exempt an existing liability, create a deduction or subject an existing deduction to new regulatory measures and that in the very nature of taxing statutes, legislature holds the power to frame laws to plug in specific leakages.        "No doubt, fiscal statutes must comply with the tenets of Article 14. However, a larger discretion is given to the legislature in taxing statutes than in other spheres. " observed the Court.         Defeating the dictum in Bharat Earth Movers case    The Bench explained that before the judgment in Bharat Earth Movers (supra), various tribunals and High Courts across the country were treating the liability in lieu of leave encashment as a contingent liability and this did not go down well with the assessees following the mercantile accounting system, as they were not able to avail deductions upon mere creation of a provision against such liability without making the actual payment. Thus,a challenge to this legal position reached before the Apex Court in Bharat Earth Movers case , wherein the Court reversed the position.    The Court opined that it is no doubt true that the legislature cannot sit over a judgment of this Court or so to speak overrule it and that there cannot be any declaration of invalidating a judgment of the Court without altering the legal basis of the judgment as a judgment is delivered with strict regard to the enactment as applicable at the relevant time.    The Justices added that once the enactment itself stands corrected, the basic cause of adjudication stands altered and necessary effect follows the same.         "A legislative body is not supposed to be in possession of a heavenly wisdom so as to contemplate all possible exigencies of their enactment.............the Parliament exercises its legislative wisdom to shortlist the most desirable solution and enacts a law to that effect. It is in the nature of a 'trial and error' exercise and we must note that a law making body, particularly in statutes of fiscal nature, is duly empowered to undertake such an exercise as long as the concern of legislative competence does not come into doubt." writes Justice Khanwilkar.       The Justices elucidated that upon the law coming into force, it becomes operative in the public domain and thus, opens itself to any review under Part III as and when it is found to be plagued with infirmities.    The Bench then explicated on the same and stated that on being invalidated by the Court, the legislature is free to diagnose such law and alter the invalid elements thereof and in doing so, the legislature is not declaring the opinion of the Court to be invalid.        The Bench noted that the judgment(Bharat Earth Movers case is an authority on the nature of the liability of leave encashment in terms of the earlier dispensation and in absence of any such provision, the sole operative provision was Section 145(1) of the 1961 Act that allowed complete autonomy to the assessee to follow the mercantile system.    The Justices iterated that a limited change has been brought about by the insertion of clause (f) in Section 43B and nothing more, it applies prospectivel and merely because a liability has been held to be a present liability qualifying for instant deduction in terms of the applicable provisions at the relevant time does not ipso facto signify that deduction against such liability cannot be regulated by a law made by Parliament prospectively; also, in matter of statutory deductions, it is open to the legislature to withdraw the same prospectively.        The Bench explicates that insertion of clause (f) has not extinguished the autonomy of the assessee to follow the mercantile system,it merely defers the benefit of deduction to be availed by the assessee for the purpose of computing his taxable income and links it to the date of actual payment thereof to the employee concerned. Thus, the only effect of the insertion of clause (f) is to regulate the stated deduction by putting it in a special provision.       "This regulatory measure is in sync with other deductions specified in Section 43B, which are also present and accrued liabilities.........irrespective of the category of liability, such deductions were regulated by law under the aegis of Section 43B, keeping in mind the peculiar exigencies of fiscal affairs and underlying concerns of public revenue." writes Justice Khanwilkar.       The Bench clarified that, a priori, merely because a certain liability has been declared to be a present liability by the Court as per the prevailing enactment, it does not follow that legislature is denuded of its power to correct the mischief with prospective effect, including to create a new liability, exempt an existing liability, create a deduction or subject an existing deduction to new regulatory measures.       The Bench stated that the Court cannot venture into hypothetical spheres while adjudging constitutionality of a duly enacted provision and unfounded limitations cannot be read into the process of judicial review.        The Bench declared that, a priori, the plea that clause (f) has been enacted with the sole purpose to defeat the judgment of this Court is misconceived.        "The position of law discussed above leaves no manner of doubt as regards the legitimacy of enacting clause (f). The respondents have neither made a case of non existence of competence nor demonstrated any constitutional infirmity in clause (f)." concluded the Bench.  [Read Judgment]    
The Calcutta High Court has recently commuted the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to a man convicted of raping a 7 year old girl after taking into account that the convict had no criminal antecedents and that he had already suffered incarceration for about 18 years.

The Calcutta High Court has recently commuted the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to a man convicted of raping a 7 year old girl after taking into account that the convict had no criminal antecedents and that he had already suffered incarceration for about 18 years.  A Bench comprising Justice Bivas Pattanayak and Justice Joymalya Bagchi opined that although in the instant case a minor victim had been raped, the accused was also a young person who was barely above 18 years of age at the time of the incident.  Commuting the life sentence imposed, the Bench observed,  "Although, the victim was a minor and was forcibly raped, appellant was also a young person who was barely above 18 years at the time of occurrence. He does not have criminal antecedents. Keeping in mind the aforesaid facts and as he has already suffered incarceration for about 18 years, I modify the sentence imposed upon the appellant and direct that he shall suffer imprisonment for the period already undergone in place of the maximum sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon him and pay the fine imposed upon him by the trial Court, in default, shall suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year." The Court further directed that the period of detention suffered by the appellant during investigation, enquiry and trial shall be set off from the substantive sentence imposed upon the appellant in terms of Section 428 of the CrPC.  The instant appeal had been preferred against a judgement dated January 19, 2005 passed by the concerned trial Court convicting the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section 376(2)(f) (rape on a woman when she is under twelve years of age) of the IPC.  In the instant case, a police complaint had bee lodged by the father of the victim after the appellant had taken his minor daughter inside a tea garden and raped her. The complainant along with his wife and minor children had gone to his in-laws' house at Beech Tea Garden when this incident took place. The mother of the victim had rushed to the post after hearing the victim's cries and had found the victim in her under garments with bleeding injuries.  Upon perusal of the record, the Court observed that the version of forcible rape as stated by the minor victim had been corroborated by her parents as well as local people. Furthermore, upholding the conviction, the Court opined,  "Her evidence also receives corroboration from the medical evidence on record. Hence, conviction of the appellant has been proved beyond doubt." Case Title: Rajinder Lohar v. The State of West Bengal    
The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently clarified that a government Hospital can't deny treatment to someone on the ground that he/she is not a resident of the area where the hospital is located.The Bench of Justice Rajbir Sehrawat observed this in a matter wherein a pregnant woman was denied medical treatment by a Government Hospital in Chandigarh on the ground that she is a resident... The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently clarified that a government Hospital can't deny treatment to someone on the ground that he/she is not a resident of the area where the hospital is located. The Bench of Justice Rajbir Sehrawat observed this in a matter wherein a pregnant woman was denied medical treatment by a Government Hospital in Chandigarh on the ground that she is a resident of Punjab and not a resident of the UT Chandigarh. Essentially, the petitioner (who is 5 months pregnant) had approached a Government Hospital in Chandigarh. and she was registered as a patient at the hospital for treatment as well. However, subsequently, she was turned out from the hospital refusing her treatment on the ground that she was not a resident of UT Chandigarh. Therefore, she moved the High Court with the instant writ petition seeking issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus, directing the respondents to provide medical treatment. During the course of the hearing, even the counsel for the respondents-UT Chandigarh could not point out any law, which entitles a Government hospital to drive out the patients by denying them medical treatment only because of the fact that they do not reside within the area where the hospital is situated.  In view of this, the Court observed thus: "Otherwise, also, the petitioner cannot be subjected to discrimination only on the ground of her place of residence. That, in fact, is a direct violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner. Denying her treatment on the above-said ground also violates her right to life and liberty without there being any justifiable reason. This decision or even tendency of Government medical facility cannot be countenanced; by any means." Agaisnt this backdrop, the Court the petition was disposed of with a direction to respondents to provide necessary medical treatment/advice to the petitioner, in normal course, as and when she approaches the respondent-hospital.  The counsel for the UT Chandigarh was further requested to take the petitioner to the hospital and to ensure that the necessary treatment of the petitioner is started with immediate effect.   
The Supreme Court directed to disburse pension to a deceased employee's widow who has been litigating for over a decade."Pension as is well known, is the deferred portion of the compensation for rendering long years of service.

The Supreme Court directed to disburse pension to a deceased employee's widow who has been litigating for over a decade. "Pension as is well known, is the deferred portion of the compensation for rendering long years of service. It is a hard-earned benefit accruing to an employee, in the nature of property,", the bench comprising Justices R. Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy observed. Following the employee's death on 12.01.2011, as per the Pension Scheme, 1998 the widow of the pensioner made claim for a sum equivalent to 100 times the full monthly pension of her husband. Vide letter dated 30.09.2012, she applied for payment of the lump sum amount in pursuance of para 15(1)(b) read with para 15(2) of the Coal Mines Pension Scheme, 1998.  As her representation was rejected, she approached the High Court by filing a writ petition. This petition was dismissed by the High court on the ground that no cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court of Patna. It was observed that the services rendered by the pensioner were outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Patna High Court and hence the writ petition filed by the widow of the pensioner was not maintainable. In appeal, the bench noted that that the Coal Mines Pension Scheme, 1998 was framed as a measure of social security for ensuring socio-economic justice for the employees in the coal sector under the powers conferred by Section 3-E of the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1948. Nevertheless, for over a decade, the widow of the employee is forced to litigate to secure the pension benefits, the court said. "While considering the appellant's case, the High Court did not however consider her entitlement on merit, but had dismissed both the Writ Petition and the LPA, citing want of territorial jurisdiction. The employment of the appellant's husband with the respondent employer is however not in dispute. Nevertheless, for over a decade, the widow of the employee is forced to litigate to secure the pension benefits".  The court disposed the appeal by observing thus: "In the above peculiar circumstances of this case, without commenting on the legality of the decision to discontinue the said provision in the pension scheme by the employer, as the pensioner was not alive on the date of discontinuance, we consider it appropriate to pass necessary orders in her favor in this proceeding itself. Resultantly, the sum due and payable under the Pension scheme be computed and the same is ordered to be disbursed to the appellant. The amount earlier refunded to the appellant be adjusted suitably during the remittance process. The respondent/ employer should do the needful in terms of this order, within 8 weeks from today."

On Friday, in an intra-court appeal whereas a Single Judge refused to interfere with the order of transfer issued against the appellant by the Chairman, North 24 Parganas District Primary School Council, the Calcutta High Court noted that the Chairman did not have the authority or jurisdiction to issue the impugned transfer order to the appellant Assistant Teacher of a Primary School.  On 7th October, 2021 the appellant was transferred being aggrieved to which the appellant had preferred a Writ Application before a Single Judge of Calcutta High Court. The single judge, while staying the transfer asked the DPSC North 24 Parganas to file report specifying the reasons of such transfer. After considering the said report the single judge set aside the order of transfer while relying on the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.    The petitioner is the head teacher of a primary school consisting of 488 students. The school to where the petitioner has been transferred consists of 125 students. The schedule in the 2009 Act mentions that the number of teachers to be maintained for a school having above 150 students only is five plus one head teacher. There is no requirement of any head teacher in respect of a school which consists of less than 150 students.   Admittedly in the instant case, the petitioner has been transferred as head teacher of a school with less than 150 students. The same could not have been done in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2009.   After this order passed by the Ld. Single Judge, the Chairman, North 24 Parganas District Primary School Council had issued an order of transfer of the appellant against which the appellant again filed a writ application which was dismissed by the Single Judge.  The Counsel for the appellant relied upon Rules 4 and 5 of the West Bengal Primary Education (Transfer of Teacher including Head Teacher) Rule, 2002 which confers the power of transfer to the District Primary School Council and not to any other authority including the Chairman.   The Counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, put reliance upon section 53(3) of The West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973 whereas the Chairman's duty included exercising general supervision and control over the Secretary, the Finance Officer and the staff appointed by the Primary School Council and post and transfer the members of the staff. The word "stuff" is defined under Section 2(xxiia) of the said act wherein it was stated that stuff means, in relation to the West Bengal Board of Primary Education, the employees appointed by the Board against posts sanctioned by the State Government and under Section 2(xxia), "teachers" means a person who holds a teaching post in a Primary teacher's Training on a regular and whole time basis and is paid wholly from the funds under the control of the State Government in the Education Department.  While concluding, that Section 53(3) of the The West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973 will not be application here, the court held:   the Chairman has invoked the authority of the Council by transferring the appellant from one school to another School, which is not permissible under law. Rule 4 specifically authorized the council to transfer an approved teacher and in the instant case admittedly the Chairman had issued the order of transfer and North 24 Parganas District Primary School Council never took any decision for transfer of the appellant.     In these circumstances, the impugned transfer order cannot be sustained in the eyes of law.   Case Title : Dipika Bala Biswas Versus State of West Bengal & Ors.     
The Himachal Pradesh High Court has recently observed that it is a misconception that water belongs to the villagers who use the same. Water is the property of the State and no individual has any right to claim this as his property, even though the same might be situated within his personal property, it clarified. The bench comprising Justices Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Virender Singh made these observations in a plea through the medium of which the petitioners had challenged the construction of proposed dam (bandh) on Bagna nalla somewhere in between villages of Balaog and Bawana near Shimla.   In their plea the petitioners submitted that by the said act of the respondents 90 to 95% inhabitants of Gram Panchayat Dhamoon, will be affected as their very source of livelihood would be snatched. Majority of the inhabitants of these panchayats are unemployed and are, thus, dependent on agriculture, they averred in their petition.  After hearing the contentions raised the bench observed that there cannot be any two opinions that natural resources are the assets of the nation and It is the obligation of all concerned, including the Central and the State Governments, to conserve and not waste such valuable resources.   Highlighting the Constitutional provisions under Article 48A and 51A prescribing the duties of the Sate in matters of environment, the bench siad that the said constitutional provisions, clearly propounded the doctrine of public trust and the said doctrine rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, water and forests are of such great importance to the people as a whole that it would be highly unjustifiable to make them a subject of private ownership.   Elaborating further on the matter the bench underscored that the State holds all the water bodies in public trust for the welfare of this generation and all the succeeding generations and, therefore, protecting water bodies must be given as much weightage as haz been given to allowing house-sites or other buildings to come up on such tanks poramboke lands, and water charged lands. Pointing towards the adequate steps already taken by the respondents to safeguard the interests of the petitioners, the court said that the project in question is being undertaken for the benefit of public at large by maintaining the necessary flow of water in the khud down stream for running of gharat and irrigation channels.  Taking note of the fact that the Gram Panchayat had already passed a resolution im favour of the project and issued no objection certificate in consequences for its construction the bench observed,  "Only four people, that two residents from village Bawana, one each from village Shilru and Panti have filed the instant petition, therefore, the same cannot be termed to be the voice of the people,as the voice of the people would be best reflected if the local rural elected bodies like gram panchayat or gram sabha would come up before the court". Terming the petition as more of a speculation as the interests of the petitioners have been adequately safeguarded and protected while formulating and implementing the scheme for raising construction of bandh, the bench dismissed the same finding it devoid of any merit.

The Supreme Court observed that equivalence of prescribed qualifications with any other given qualification cannot be decided by the courts invoking its power of judicial review. Equivalence of qualification is a matter for the State, as recruiting authority, to determine, the court said. The bench comprising Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari set aside a High Court judgment which held that the diploma/degree in Art and Craft given by the Kurukshetra University is equivalent to two-year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or diploma in Art and Craft conducted by Director, Industrial Training and Vocational Education, Haryana. In this case, one of the criteria of eligibility read thus: (ii) Two year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or an equivalent qualification recognized by the Haryana Education Department. The case of the writ petitioners is that they passed their matriculation with the subject of Arts and Crafts/Drawing or they have passed the subject of Arts and Crafts/Drawing in their matriculation as additional subject. The High Court allowed the writ petitions. In appeal, the court noticed that the experts in the Education Department have held the diploma in Art and Craft by the Kurukshetra University is not equivalent to the two-year diploma in Art and Craft awarded by the Haryana Industrial Training Department. The court noticed the following principles in this regard: The question regarding equivalence of educational qualifications is a technical question based on proper assessment and evaluation of the relevant academic standards and practical attainments of such qualifications. Where the decision of the Government is based on the recommendation of an expert body, then the Court, uninformed of relevant data and unaided by technical insights necessary for the purpose of determining equivalence, would not lightly disturb the decision of the Government unless it is based on extraneous or irrelevant considerations or actuated mala fides or is irrational and perverse or manifestly wrong. ( Mohammad Shujat Ali v. Union of India )It is not for the court to consider the relevance of qualification prescribed for various posts. (J. Ranga Swamy v. Government of Andhra Pradesh)The prescribed eligibility qualification for admission to a course or for recruitment to or promotion in service are matters to be considered by the appropriate authority. (State of Rajasthan v. Lata Arun)The equivalence is a technical academic matter. It cannot be implied or assumed. Any decision of the academic body of the university relating to equivalence should be by a specific order or resolution, duly published (Guru Nanak Dev University v. Sanjay Kumar Katwal)The State, as an employer, is entitled to prescribe qualifications as a condition of eligibility, after taking into consideration the nature of the job, the aptitude required for efficient discharge of duties, functionality of various qualifications, course content leading up to the acquisition of various qualifications, etc. (Zahoor Ahmad Rather & Ors. v. Sheikh Imtiyaz Ahmad) Allowing the appeal, the court observed thus: Judicial review can neither expand the ambit of the prescribed qualifications nor decide the equivalence of the prescribed qualifications with any other given qualification. Equivalence of qualification is a matter for the State, as recruiting authority, to determine. .. Having regard to the above, in our view, the High Court has erred in holding that the diploma/degree in Art and Craft given by the Kurukshetra University is equivalent to two-year Diploma in Art and Craft examination conducted by the Haryana Industrial Training Department or diploma in Art and Craft conducted by Director, Industrial Training and Vocational Education, Haryana.

In a significant judgment relating to prisoners' right, the Uttarakhand High Court has held that Police personnel cannot be appointed as Jail Superintendents.  A Division Bench comprising of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma observed that we have come to the age of "Reformation and Rehabilitation of Prisoners".  It held that the purpose of Police is very different from that of Jail Superintendents and as a natural corollary, their trainings and psyche are poles apart. Hence, the former cannot possess the position of the latter.  "The purpose of the Police is not to reform, or to rehabilitate, but to prevent the occurrence of crime, and to punish the criminals. Therefore, the very training of a police personnel is carried out with a different purpose in mind, and with different goals prescribed by law. Thus, there is a vast difference in the philosophy that permeates the police administration, and the jail administration. Hence, even their training and the psychology of the police personnel and prison personnel are poles apart," the order stated.  The observations come in a PIL challenging a State Government's order whereby the Officers of the Police Department were given the additional charge of the office of the Senior Superintendent/Superintendent of Jail at Sitarganj, Haldwani, Haridwar, Dehradun and Roorkee.  In its judgment declaring the impugned order as illegal, the Division Bench stressed on the need for carefully selecting the prison personnel, for providing rigorous training, both prior to their joining the service, and subsequent thereto, of the appointment being a full-time, regular appointment.   "It is only when these factors are inculcated in the prison administration that the prison system succeeds in protecting, reforming and rehabilitating the prisoners. Otherwise, it is a self-defeating proposition," it observed.  Prison History  In its order, the Bench ventured into various recommendations made by several committees over a period time, for efficient prison system, well-trained full time prison staff and proper development of the prison population.  In 1920, the Bench noted, the "All India Jail Committee" for the first time recommended the reformation and rehabilitation of offenders as one of the objectives of the prison administration. The Committee spoke about adequate training of the prison staff, and about the separation of executive/custodial, ministerial and technical staff in prison service. The Committee believed that a different sort of training needs to be provided to the prison staff, than the training being provided to the police staff  The Jail recommendations made by Dr. WC Reckless, a UN Expert on Correctional Work, proposed the reformative theory of punishment; specialized training of correctional personnel; and the need for a cadre of properly trained personnel staff.  In 1972, a Working Group on Prisons emphasised the need for proper training of prison personnel. It also stressed that "prison administration should be treated as an integral part of the social defence components of national planning process".  In 1980, the All India Committee on Jail Reforms recommended that State should endeavour to develop a well-organized prison cadre based on appropriate job requirements, sound training and proper promotional avenues.  Finally, in 2009, the Ministry of Home Affairs had written to the Principal Secretary (Prison)/Secretary (Home) (In-charge of Prisons) - All State Governments / UTs DGs/ IGs incharge of prisons- All State Governments / UTs, wherein it made certain recommendations as under:  Establishing well equipped training infrastructure in the State, with adequate skilled and well qualified instructional staff, to cater to the normal needs of basic and in-service training for the prison staff in different discipline.Creating adequate posts for prison staff as per norms in different categories, commensurate with operational needs of safe custody, reformation, rehabilitation, health care, legal assistance etc.Filling up all the vacancies, presently running up to 17.58% (in 2006) within time bound frame and ensure proper cadre management through timely trainings, promotions, recruitments etc.  Nelson Mandela Rules  The Bench has also taken note of the United Nations has issued "Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners", better known as "the Nelson Mandela Rules".  These Rules, inter alia, provide for "careful selection of every grade of the personnel"; "integrity, humanity, professional capacity, and personal suitability for the work that the proper administration of prisons depends"; appointment of prison personnel "on a full-time basis";   It specifically referred to Rule 75(2) which states that "before entering on duty, all prison staff shall be provided with training tailored to their general and specific duties, which shall be reflective of contemporary evidence-based best practice in penal sciences".  Since India is a member of the United Nations, these Rules are equally binding on the country and they cannot be ignored, observed the Court.  Uttar Pradesh Jail (Group A and B) Service Rules, 1982  Lastly, the Bench referred to the abovesaid Rules, which clearly provide a procedure for determination of vacancy, and selection and promotion for filling up the post in prisons.  "A bare perusal of these Rules of 1982 clearly reveals that the post of Superintendent of Jail necessarily has to be filled up either by direct recruitment (fifty percent), or by promotion (fifty percent). The Rules do not permit an ad-hoc appointment from any other service, much less the police service. Therefore, the post can be filled up either directly from candidates from the open market, or from the post of Deputy Superintendents/Jailors having a work experience of minimum of five years. Hence, the appointment of the police personnel, by the impugned orders, is clearly illegal," it held.  The Bench proceeded to reject the argument made by the State Government that the Inspector General of Prisons and the Additional Inspector General of Prisons can be appointed from the IPS cadre.  It held,  "It is a settled position of law that once a procedure has been established by law, it cannot be circumvented from. Therefore, merely because the post of Inspector General of Prisons, and Additional Inspector General of Prisons can be filled up from persons belonging to the IPS cadre, it does not empower the State to fill up the post of the lower echelons by posting police personnel on the post of Senior Superintendent/Superintendent of Jail."

The Uttarakhand High Court on Wednesday observed that forcing the family of a prisoner to travel through the mountainous terrain and to come down to the plains to meet and interact with a relative-prisoner, prima facie, violates fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India of prisoners and their family members. This assertion came from the Bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma while noting that the Uttarakhand government, on account of overcrowding of jails, has been transferring many inmates from jails situated in mountainous districts to the plain districts Stressing that it is imperative that a prisoner should be kept as close to his family location as possible, the Court called it 'surprising' that prisoners from Tehri, Chamoli, and Pauri, the mountainous districts of this State, were being transferred to Haridwar and Dehradun by the State Government. "Generally the prisoners should not be transferred far away from their family. For, it is imperative that the familial relationship should continue between the prisoner and his family despite the fact that the prisoner is incarcerated. The family relationship is essential not only for the emotional support of the prisoner, but also as a means to reform the prisoner, and to motivate him or her to reform him or herself to the extent that he or she can be brought back into the society as a law abiding citizen," the Court remarked. Essentially, the Court was perusing the affidavits filed by Secretary (Home), and the Inspector General of Prisons, Uttarakhand pursuant to the order of Court, the Court noted that in the entire State of Uttarakhand, there is only one Central Jail and all the other jails are either District Jails or Sub-Jails. Further, the Court noted that the total capacity in all the jails for keeping inmates is 3540, however, as of April 7, 2021, there are 6499 inmates, including 192 female inmates in the jails. It is against this backdrop, that the State submitted that due to overcrowding of the jails, it periodically transfers prisoners from one jail to another. Court's observations  Having persued the affidavit, the Court observed that despite admitting the fact that jails are overcrowded in Uttarakhand, there is not a single suggestion in the affidavit with regard to the creation of new sets of jails. The Court also noted that there is no suggestion or recommendation for the construction of a larger jail at Haldwani and even in Pithoragarh, seven crores of rupees were invested for the construction of the jail wall, but even today,  the court noted, Pithoragarh does not have a fully functional and furnished jail. Significantly, the Court called it 'surprising' that the prisoners in Uttarakhand continue to 5 languish in jail without proper facilities, and without any endeavor to upgrade their skills. Further, noting that although the State does claim that it has a shortening of sentence policy, which was promulgated on February 09, 2021, the said policy is full of lacunae.  Therefore, the Court opined that even the said policy would need to be re-considered and re-examined by the State. The Court even called the sentence suspension policy of the State as a flawed one. Therefore, the Court directed the learned Inspector General of Prisons to first visit each of the jails functioning in the State, and to submit a detailed report about the conditions of the jail along with photographs of the jail.  He has also been directed to put forth the vision for improving and reforming the conditions of the jail and to give his opinion on the issue whether, more open air jails should be created within the State, or not. Lastly, he was directed to convey his vision for improving the entire jail administration, including the jails which may be required for the future needs of the State. The Case has now been listed for December 8, 2021, for further hearing.  Read order  
The Allahabad High Court recently upheld the order of a Session Court awarding life imprisonment to 2 persons after finding them guilty of committing gang rape against a 7-year-old girl in the year 2010.  Refusing to reduce the sentence awarded to the convicts, the bench of Justice Suneet Kumar and Justice Umesh Chandra Sharma observed thus:  “It is not a case of rape by juvenile, a single accused with a mature lady or with a girl who is on the verge of attaining the age of puberty or majority. The victim was not knowing even the nature of the offence. Therefore, considering the nature of injuries, age of the victim, age of the accused persons and that it is a case of gang rape with a little girl, this Court is of the view that the trial court has rightly imposed the sentence of life imprisonment and fine of Rs.10,000/- each.”  The case in brief  As per the prosecution’s case, the convicts, on the pretext of bringing gutkha, carried the victim, a 7-year-old girl to a drain situated in the east of the village and forcibly raped her.  When the victim did not return for a long time, her parents started searching for her and that is when they heard the victim's scream coming from the side of the drain.   The informant (father of the victim), his wife and other villagers reached there and saw that two of the convicts were holding his daughter’s hands and the third accused was doing bad things with her. Seeing them all the three accused persons ran away leaving the victim covered in blood.   The ASJ, Pilibhit on August 25, 2011, convicted the accused-appellants under Section 376(2)(g) IPC and they were awarded life imprisonment and Rs.10,000/- fine each.  Challenging their conviction, they moved to the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal, one convict named Lal Jeet died and thus, the appeal so far as he was concerned, stood abated.  High Court’s observations  The court noted that the case was based on direct evidence and on the evidence of the victim and from the evidence, the mens rea to commit the alleged offence had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.   The Court noted that it was also proved from the evidence of the prosecution witness that there was no enmity or false implication of the accused persons.   Taking into account various rulings of the Apex Court, the Court observed that where a girl child is the victim of offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC, she has to be given some weight as is given to an injured witness and her evidence needs no corroboration.  In the instant case, the Court said the victim had deposed that all three accused persons did bad things to her and that all three accused persons had taken her outside the village and pushed her on the ground, thereafter, they raped her.   Regarding the medical evidence, the Court noted that the victim was medically examined by PW-7, Dr. Vijay Laxmi, wherein she had admitted and deposed that the victim was raped. In view of this, the court found her testimony not to be contrary to the prosecution evidence.  Against this backdrop, finding justification in the order and judgement of the trial Court in determining the guilt of the convicts, the High Court observed thus:  “…this Court is of the considered view that the accused appellants committed gang rape with the victim, a girl of a tender age, not understanding any one characteristics of sex and pleasure related to it. Even her sexual organs were not developed properly. The victim was of the age of a girl child of the accused persons, even then they committed such cruel, merciless, illegal and uncivilized act with her. 47. In view of the above discussion, it is concluded that the learned trial court committed no illegality in holding the accused persons guilty of committing gang rape.”  Further, when the counsels for the accused-appellants argued that considering the age and future life of the accused, a lenient view may be adopted so far as sentencing is concerned, the Court observed that it was a case of rape of a tender-aged girl, who was not knowing even the nature of the offence.  In this regard, the Court referred to several rulings of the Apex Court in such rape cases (committed against minor girls) wherein it was observed that the punishment ought to be commensurate to the gravity of the crime.  Against this backdrop, finding no mitigating circumstances present to reduce the sentence already imposed by the trial court, the Court upheld the order of punishment and sentence by the trial court.  Appearances  Counsel for Appellants: Suresh Singh Yadav, Kuldeep Johri Counsel, Ajay Kumar Srivastava, Ajay Kumar Kashyap and Subhash Chandra Yadav   For Respondent: Govt. Advocate   Case title - Lal Jeet and Tej Bahadur vs. State of U.P. along with a connected appeal     
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently ruled that an employee cannot be denied medical reimbursement solely on the ground that he had undergone treatment in a speciality hospital by himself, which was not at all recognized or approved by the State or not included in the Government order. "The amount of medical reimbursement is constitutional obligation towards sufferer which is a beneficial legislation in a welfare State for its employees, therefore, the rules and instructions formulated should be construed liberally in favour of the employees for granting them the relief rather than to adopt the wooden attitude to deprive the person of his/her dues." The observations were made by Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal in a plea wherein the petitioner had sought a writ of mandamus commanding upon the respondents to settle down their medical claims in respect of the treatment provided to the deceased-husband of the lead Petitioner.  The facts of the instant case were that the deceased, while performing his duties, got seriously ill and was shifted to Government Medical College Hospital, Jammu in the year 2009. Since his health condition continued to deteriorate, he was shifted to Apollo Hospital, New Delhi in the Emergency Wing where doctors attended him and he was advised certain tests to be carried out. On the basis of tests conducted on him, the deceased was diagnosed as suffering from blood cancer.  Since the family of the deceased did not have enough resources to get him treated in the Apollo Hospital at New Delhi, he came to be shifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (AIIMS) in a serious condition where he came to be admitted in the Emergency Wing, where the petitioners felt that the response of the doctors towards the deceased was not good, as such, finding no alternative the deceased was shifted back to Apollo Hospital, New Delhi for chemotherapy.  Adjudicating upon the matter, Justice Nargal observed that it is an admitted position that the husband of petitioner No. 1 has undergone the treatment for blood cancer from Apollo Hospital as is evident from the medical bills.  Explaining the "BSNL Employees Medical Reimbursement Policy" which squarely covered the instant case, Justice Nargal observed that it is emphatically clear that by virtue of clause 2.2.0, an employee (including retired employee) and his/her dependants shall be entitled to reimbursement of expenses at the approved rates at all hospitals recognized from time to time by the management.  "The aforesaid Scheme also provides for recognized hospitals/nursing homes and clause 2.2.2 provides that in emergency cases, the reimbursement would be allowed for treatment in non-recognized hospital with the approval of CGM for field office employees and concerned Director of BSNL Board for C.O. employees", the bench underscored.  Vouching for a liberal application of the scheme the bench maintained that the respondents have to keep in mind that the technicality of the rules and regulations are not required to be followed just in a mechanical manner so as to frustrate the very purpose of the Scheme. Each case has to be examined on its own facts before taking any final decision and it goes without saying that to preserve health and medical aid in furtherance of the self preservation is a part of right of life as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and in the present case, the petitioners are held entitled for medical reimbursement of their expenses, said the court.  Fortifying the adopted position the bench found it worthwhile to record the observations of Supreme Court in Shiv Kant Jha Vs. Union of India reported as 2018,  "The right to medical claim cannot be denied merely because the name of the hospital is not included in the Government Order. The real test must be the factum of treatment. Before any medical claim is honoured, the authorities are bound to ensure as to whether the claimant had actually taken treatment and the factum of treatment is supported by records duly certified by Doctors/Hospitals concerned. Once, it is established, the claim cannot be denied on technical grounds".  Allowing the petition the court directed the respondents to process the medical bills of the deceased and release the same in favour of the petitioners within a period of two months from the date the copy of this order is served upon respondents in respect of which all the bills required have already been submitted by the petitioners besides completing all the medical formalities.

The Supreme Court has held that the embargo for grant of bail under Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act will not be attracted if the chargesheet does not reveal a prima facie case.'"The stringent conditions for grant of bail in sub-section (5) of Section 43D will apply only to the offences punishable only under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act...The embargo... The Supreme Court has held that the embargo for grant of bail under Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act will not be attracted if the chargesheet does not reveal a prima facie case.' "The stringent conditions for grant of bail in sub-section (5) of Section 43D will apply only to the offences punishable only under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act...The embargo will apply when after perusing charge sheet, the Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true. Thus, if after perusing the charge sheet, if the Court is unable to draw such a prima facie conclusion, the embargo created by the proviso will not apply",  a bench comprising Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay Sreeniwas Oka  stated. The bench was deciding the case of bail related to Kerala students Thwaha Fasal and Allan Shuhabi, who were charged under the UAPA over alleged links to banned Maoist group. While the Special NIA Court allowed them bail after noting that the chargesheet did not reveal a prima facie case against them, the High Court on appeal reversed those findings. The High Court set aside the bail granted to Thwaha but sustained Allan's bail on consideration of his medical condition of depression and younger age. The Supreme Court allowed Thwaha's appeal against the High Court judgment and dismissed NIA's appeal against the bail granted to Allan. The judgment authored by Justice Oka referred to the SC precedent in National Investigation Agency v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali and observed : "Therefore, while deciding a bail petition filed by an accused against whom offences under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act have been alleged, the Court has to consider whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the accused is prima facie true. If the Court is satisfied after examining the material on record that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the accused is prima facie true, then the accused is entitled to bail. Thus, the scope of inquiry is to decide whether prima facie material is available against the accused of commission of the offences alleged under Chapters IV and VI. The grounds for believing that the  accusation against the accused is prima facie true must be reasonable grounds. Court not expected to conduct a mini trial to ascertain prima facie case The judgment further noted that the Court is not expected to do a "mini trial" to ascertain prima facie case. At this stage, the Court has to take the material in the chargesheet "as it is". "However, the Court while examining the issue of prima facie case as required by sub-section (5) of Section 43D is not expected to hold a mini trial. The Court is not supposed to examine the merits and demerits of the evidence. If a charge sheet is already filed, the Court has to examine the material forming a part of charge sheet for deciding the issue whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such a person is prima facie true. While doing so, the Court has to take the material in the charge sheet as it is". In the instant case, the Court noted that taking the charge sheet as correct, at the highest, it can be said that the material prima facie establishes association of the accused with a terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist) and their support to the organisation. However, there is no material to show that they had "intention to further the activities" of the terror group, so as  to attract the grave offences under Sections 38 and 39 of the UAPA. The Supreme Court observed that the findings of the Special Court was based on the materials of the chargesheet. The High Court has not recorded any prima facie case regarding the intention to further the activities of terror group. "The High Court observed that the learned Special Judge has oversimplified the matter. However, the High Court did not notice that by taking the material collected during the investigation which forms a part of the charge sheet as it is, the Special Court had recorded a prima facie finding regarding the absence of any material to show intention on the part of the accused to further the activities of CPI (Maoist). The High Court has not recorded prima facie finding on this aspect. By applying the law laid down in the case of Watali (supra), there were no reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against the accused nos.1 and 2 of commission of offences under Sections 38 and 39 were prima facie true", the Court noted. The Court also noted that stringent conditions have been imposed by the Special Court for bail. Accordingly, the Special Court's order was restored and the High Court's judgment was set aside.

The Bombay High Court pulled up the complainant teacher for putting up banners seeking the principal's arrest, while granting anticipatory bail to the principal accused of hurling casteist remarks, a punishable offence under the SC/ST Act, at an "under-performing" teacher.  Dr Lekha Visaria, the appellant had approached the High Court after an FIR under section 3(1)(r) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was registered against her on February 9, 2022, on a teacher's complaint regarding an incident from October 2021.   Justice Madhav Jamdar held that the teacher's act of publishing a banner and then putting it up, emanated from the thought of seeking vengeance and was "uncalled for."  "Once the complaint is lodged, FIR registered, the publication of the banner is uncalled for. Complainant cannot seek extra judicial remedies to pressurize the prosecution. Prosecution will carry out the investigation on the basis of cogent material on record and its investigation process. Parties should desist from such acts and allow the prosecution to do its duty in accordance with law."  Other reasons that weighed in on the judge were the delay in filing the FIR, the absence of a caste-reference in the alleged incriminating conversation between the teacher and principal and allegations regarding the teacher's poor performance.   Facts of the Case   The complainant a teacher of Swami Vivekanand School was allegedly pulled up and asked to apologise after several mistakes were found in the marksheet and evaluation of class 10 students during the 2021 examination, last monsoon. Other teachers were also asked to do the same.   However, it was alleged that on August 15, after the flag hoisting ceremony the principal insulted the complainant regarding her teaching skills. She complained to the trustee about this. However, she was served a notice for dereliction the next day. On the date of the incident, October 5, 2021, the teacher was allegedly summoned to the principal's cabin, stating that the apology letter was still not given. That's when the casteist slurs were allegedly made.   She alleged that thereafter two other teachers entered the cabin on the 5th, and even in front of them the tirade continued. Subsequently on December 1, 2021 the teacher was asked to teach class 5 & 6 standard students instead of her std 10 batch and Twenty-three days later she approached the police and an FIR was registered months later, in February.   Arguments   The advocate appearing for the principal submitted that only after the teacher's evaluation and her down-gradation to class 5 and 6, the complaint was filed. He emphasized the acrimony and animosity between the complainant and teacher.   Moreover, he argued that there is no reference whatsoever to the caste of the complainant in the alleged utterance narrated in the FIR.   The advocate for the teacher claimed that she may have approached the police a couple of months later, but the she had already complained to the trustee, the board etc. Therefore, the delay in lodging the FIR was explained.   The court however observed, "Prima facie it is seen that there is no reference to the caste of the informant by the Appellant in the statement which has been alleged to be insulting according to the complainant."  Regarding the eye witnesses the court said, "What is pertinent to note is the fact that though it is claimed that there were two eye witnesses to the incident, what was stated in front of the eye witnesses is not stated / narrated or complained of in the FIR.   Save and except the incident on 05.10.2021, there is no other specific incident about which the informant has made a grievance and which could remotely attract the provisions of the Atrocities Act."

"It is deplorable that the representative of the public compel the public servant to pass illegal orders and the public servant comply their illegal dictates without any demur," observed the Allahabad High Court recently in one of its orders. The Bench of Justice Siddharth made this stern remark while allowing a plea filed by one Basrat Ullah challenging an order passed by Special Secretary, UP Govt removing him as the Principal of Madarsa Darul Uloom Ahle Sunnat Badrool Uloom at District Basti. It was his case that in the year 2019, he was appointed to the post of Principal in the said madrasa and prior to his appointment, he had worked as an assistant teacher at the Darul Uloom Ahle Sunnat Madrasa in Gonda for five years. Based on his experience, he was appointed to the post of Principal. He joined his duties in October 2019, however, a complaint was made against his appointment and the State Government directed inquiry into the allegations which led to passing of an order dated 23.07.2020.  Now, a local Member of Legislative Assembly sent a letter to the Chief Minister of the State alleging that the conditional order of approval of appointment of the petitioner dated 23.07.2020 was against the Rules and should be cancelled.  Pursuant to this, the Special Secretary, UP Govt cancelled the approved appointment of the petitioner. It was his contention before the Court that his appointment was cancelled without holding inquiry and proving the allegations against the petitioner before the inquiry officer by leading reliable evidence. It was submitted that the impugned orders are absolutely arbitrarily and have been passed on the dictate of Member of Legislative Assembly. Against this backdrop, after hearing the rival contentions, the Court noted that only the complaint made by Sanjay Pratap Jaiswal, local MLA and Swami Prasad Maurya, Minister of Labour and employment U.P. was considered by the special secretary and thereafter a decision was taken to cancel the approval of appointment of the petitioner. "It is deplorable that the representative of the public compel the public servant to pass illegal orders and the public servant comply their illegal dictates without any demur. The illegality in the conduct of the respondents is apparent from the material on record. The impugned orders have been passed in gross violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and are hereby quashed," the Court remarked as it directed that the petitioner be reinstated in service forthwith and his arrears of salary be paid to him within six weeks.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday observed that no Class-IV employee should normally be transferred out of the district. The Bench of Justice Vivek Chaudhary made this observation while setting aside a transfer order passed against a Class IV Employee as it noted that the same was punitive in nature.Essentially, the petitioner Smt. Maya (a Class IV Employee) was transferred by State... The Allahabad High Court on Monday observed that no Class-IV employee should normally be transferred out of the district. The Bench of Justice Vivek Chaudhary made this observation while setting aside a transfer order passed against a Class IV Employee as it noted that the same was punitive in nature. Essentially, the petitioner Smt. Maya (a Class IV Employee) was transferred by State Medical Health Department from Lucknow to Kanpur by transfer order dated July 12, 2021, on administrative grounds, however, the officer responsible for her transfer did not give any reason whatsoever for transferring her. Therefore, she approached the Allahabad High Court on the ground that Class-IV employee cannot be transferred so far away. Hearing her plea, the Court earlier directed that her representation against the said transfer order be considered and decided on merits. However, while deciding the representation, a large number of allegations were leveled against her including that she remains on leave, she acts in a whimsical manner which causes disturbances in the work, etc. Her counsel submitted before the Court that even presuming Class-IV employee is to be transferred on punishment, the same cannot be to a faraway place and has to be within the same district. It was further submitted is that the impugned order was also passed without providing any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. Agaisnt this backdrop, the Court noted that allegations had been leveled against her in rejecting her representation against the impugned transfer order, and therefore, the transfer order was punitive in nature. Therefore, stressing that no punishment can be awarded to the petitioner without giving any opportunity of hearing, the Court concluded that the impugned order can't stand. "It is further to be noted that no Class-IV employee should normally be transferred out of the district. The department itself follows the said policy as is reflected in the transfer order dated 12.07.2021 itself, by which five Class-IV employees are transferred, three of them on personal request out of district, the fourth in public interest within the district and fifth, petitioner, is transferred out of district on administrative grounds. When the department is making out of district transfer only on request and otherwise accommodating persons within the district, there was no reason to transfer the petitioner out of district," the Court further added as it set aside the impugned transfer order. 
The Supreme Court has observed that mere exhibition brandishing or holding a weapon openly by offender to threaten and create fear or apprehension in the mind of the victim is sufficient to constitute an offence u/s 397 IPC.The bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli was considering an appeal assailing Madhya Pradesh High Court's order of upholding the conviction by trial... The Supreme Court has observed that mere exhibition brandishing or holding a weapon openly by offender to threaten and create fear or apprehension in the mind of the victim is sufficient to constitute an offence u/s 397 IPC. The bench of CJI NV Ramana, Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli was considering an appeal assailing Madhya Pradesh High Court's order of upholding the conviction by trial court u/s 392/397 of IPC and Sections 11/13 of Madhya Pradesh Dakaiti Aur Vyapharan Pravbhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam 1981 Act ("Act"). The issue before the Top Court was:  Whether charge u/s 397 IPC was sustainable since the appellant had contended that the firearm had not been put up to useWould charge u/s 397 IPC be sustainable if there was no material or evidence to indicate that accused appellant had used the firearm irrespective of occurring of the alleged incident  The bench in Ram Ratan v State of Madhya Pradesh partly allowed the appeal while upholding the conviction of the appellant u/s 392 IPC and setting aside the conviction u/s 397 of IPC and Sections 11/13 of Madhya Pradesh Dakaiti Aur Vyapharan Pravbhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam 1981 Act. It thus observed, "From the position of law as enunciated by this Court and noted above, firstly, it is clear that the use of the weapon to constitute the offence under Section 397 IPC does not require that the 'offender' should actually fire from the firearm or actually stab if it is a knife or a dagger but the mere exhibition of the same, brandishing or holding it openly to threaten and create fear or apprehension in the mind of the victim is sufficient. The other aspect is that if the charge of committing the offence is alleged against all the accused and only one among the 'offenders' had used the firearm or deadly weapon, only such of the 'offender' who has used the firearm or deadly weapon alone would be liable to be charged under Section 397 IPC." Factual Background A complaint was lodged by Rajesh Meena on June 27, 2012 alleging that on the intervening night of June 26/27 June 2012 while he was sleeping in the hut constructed in the field to guard the crops at 2:30 AM, the appellant ("Ram Ratan") along with Raju and Chotu came to him and woke him up. Raju was having a gun with him and he pointed the same towards the complainant's chest and demanded to part with the money. Since the complainant did not have any money, the accused(s) took the key of his motorcycle and forced him to sit on the motorcycle along with them. Since the motorcycle got punctured, the accused(s) compelled the complainant to get down and took away the same. The complainant lodged the complaint and on completion of investigation, the police filed the charge sheet u/s Sections 392/397 of IPC and u/s 11/13 of Madhya Pradesh Dakaiti Aur Vyapharan Pravbhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam 1981 Act ("Act"). On February 26, 2013 the trial court framed charges under Sections 392/397 of IPC and Sections 11/13 of MPDVPK Act, 1981 against the appellant and Chotu, while an additional charge under Section 25 (1­B) (a)/27 of the Arms Act was framed against the other co ­accused namely, Raju.  On analysing the evidence, the Trial Court opined that the appellant and his co­ accused had indulged in the incident and therefore held the charge to be proved and accordingly handed down the sentence and conviction. Assailing the Trial Court's judgement, the appellant and the co accused approached the High Court wherein they contended that the case had been falsely alleged against them and that the charge u/s 397 of IPC could not be sustained. They further contended that the firearm even if it was proved to be carried, had not been used and as such the charge under Section 397 IPC would not lie.  After re appreciating the evidence in detail, the High Court upheld the judgment passed by the trial court convicting the appellant and sentencing him in the manner as has been done.  Aggrieved, the appellant approached the Top Court.  Submission Of Counsels Advocate Shishir Kumar appearing for the appellant while referring to the Top Court's judgement in Ganesan vs. State Rep. by Station House Officer Crl. Appeal No.904 of 2021 submitted that charge u/s 397 of the IPC would not be sustainable since the gun had not been used and the conviction could be sustained only if the 'offender' used any deadly weapon while committing robbery. It was his further contention that charge under Section 397 IPC would not be sustainable against the appellant herein since there was no serious allegation or proof of the appellant having used any weapon much less deadly weapon even if the incident of robbery which occurred was held to be proved against the appellant. Advocate Sunny Choudhary appearing for the State submitted that when the expert had opined that the gun was in working condition, the actual use of the firearm by firing from it was not required but the exposure of the weapon so as to create fear in the mind of the victim was sufficient to prove the charge under Section 397 IPC. Supreme Court's Analysis The bench in the judgement authored by Justice AS Bopanna referred to the Top Court's judgements in Shri Phool Kumar vs. Delhi Administration (1975) 1 SCC 797, Dilawar Singh vs. State of Delhi (2007) 12 SCC 641 and Ganesan vs. State Rep. by Station House Officer Crl. Appeal No.904 of 2021. With regards to the contention of petitioner's counsel that charge u/s 397 IPC would not be sustainable as there was no material or evidence to indicate that accused appellant had used the firearm irrespective of occurring of the alleged incident, the bench said that benefit of the interpretation raised on the scope of Section 397 IPC to hold the aggressor alone as being guilty, would be available to the appellant if there is no specific allegation against him. "Though the above would be the effect and scope of Section 397 IPC as a standalone provision, the application of the same will arise in the totality of the allegation and the consequent charge that will be framed and the accused would be tried for such charge. In such circumstance, in the teeth of the offence under Section 397 IPC being applicable to the offender alone, the vicariability of the same will also have to be noted if the charge against the accused under Sections 34, 149 IPC and such other provisions of law, which may become relevant, is also invoked along with Section 397 IPC. In such an event, it will have to be looked at differently in the totality of the facts, evidence and circumstances involved in that case and the provisions invoked in that particular case to frame a charge against the accused. In the instant case, the charge under Section 34 IPC was not framed against the appellant nor was such an allegation raised and proved against the appellant. Hence, benefit of the interpretation raised on the scope of Section 397 IPC to hold the aggressor alone as being guilty, will be available to the appellant if there is no specific allegation against him," the bench said in this regard. On the aspect of conviction u/s 392 IPC, the bench opined that,  "It is no doubt true, that the appellant had participated in the offence of committing robbery since ultimately the motorcycle was hidden at a place which was known to the appellant and the property seizure memo indicates that the motorcycle was recovered at the instance of the appellant that certainly constitutes an offender under Section 392 IPC." Accordingly the bench while partly allowing the appeal, set aside the judgement to the extent it convicted the appellant u/sSection 397 IPC read with Sections 11/13 of MPDVPK Act, 1981 and sustained the appellant's conviction u/s 392 IPC. Case Title: Ram Ratan v State of Madhya Pradesh| Criminal Appeal No.1333 Of 2018 Coram: CJI NV Ramana, Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli    
Observing that electricity is an essential service, the Delhi High Court has said that a person cannot be deprived of it without a cogent and lawful reason.  Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri in a judgment passed on Monday said that it is well-settled that even if disputes exist regarding the ownership of a property at which an electricity connection is sought, the concerned authorities cannot deprive the legal occupant of the same by insisting that a no objection certificate (NOC) be furnished from others, who also claim to be owners.  Reliance was placed on a recent Supreme Court ruling in Dilip (Dead) through Lrs. v. Satish & Others wherein it was held that electricity cannot be declined to a tenant on the ground of failure or refusal of the landlord to issue NOC. It was also said by the Supreme Court that all that the electricity supply authority is required to examine is whether the applicant for electricity connection is in occupation of the premises in question. The court was dealing with a plea filed by a couple, who are senior citizens, seeking installation of a fresh electricity meter at their premises without insisting for NOC from the husband's three brothers. The parties are engaged in a partition suit with respect to the subject property. It was submitted on behalf of the petitioners that while electricity was granted to two of the respondents without insisting on NOC from the petitioners, the latter have been denied the same for want of NOC from the former. "Presently, the electricity supply to the portion occupied by petitioners in the subject premises is received as per inter se arrangement, however the same has led to multiple disputes between the parties," the court was told. The petitioners undertook to comply with all the codal and commercial formalities of BSES and submitted that there are no outstanding dues with respect to electricity connection installed at the subject premises. On the other hand, the counsel appearing for BSES submitted that the petitioners' request for a new electricity connection was not acceded to in view of the objections raised by the brothers. The court was apprised, on instructions, that there are no pending dues with respect to electricity connection installed at the subject premises. Following court's observation that supply of electricity cannot be denied to the petitioners, the BSES counsel said that their application for fresh electricity connection would be considered in accordance with law without insisting on NOC from the brothers. "Respondent No.2 shall process the petitioners' application for providing fresh electricity connection forthwith without insisting on NOC from respondent Nos.3 to 5 within two weeks from the date of filing of the application," said the court. The court also directed the petitioners to pay the consumption charges in accordance with the bills raised by BSES from time to time or till the time they occupy the subject premises. "Respondent No.2 shall be entitled to disconnect the electricity supply at the subject premises in case petitioners fail to pay the electricity charges. Application of the petitioners shall be processed and electricity connection shall be installed within two working days of the petitioners completing all the formalities," the court added.

The Supreme Court reiterated that the Section 202(2) CrPC is inapplicable to complaints under Section 138 in respect of the examination of witnesses on oath. The Court observed that the evidence of witnesses on behalf of the complainant shall be permitted on affidavit."If the Magistrate holds an inquiry himself, it is not compulsory that he should examine witnesses and in suitable cases... The Supreme Court reiterated that the Section 202(2) CrPC is inapplicable to complaints under Section 138 in respect of the examination of witnesses on oath.  The Court observed that the evidence of witnesses on behalf of the complainant shall be permitted on affidavit. "If the Magistrate holds an inquiry himself, it is not compulsory that he should examine witnesses and in suitable cases the Magistrate can examine documents to be satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding under Section 202", the bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna observed while dismissing an appeal filed against a Gujarat High Court judgment refusing to quash a complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. One of the issues raised by the accused was whether the Magistrate, in view of Section 202 CrPC, ought to have postponed the issuance of process? The accused had contended that Section 202 CrPC envisages the postponement of the issuance of process where the accused resides beyond the jurisdiction of the territory of the court. In this case, no inquiry was carried out by the Magistrate. The court noted as follows: Under Sub-Section (1) of Section 202, a Magistrate upon the receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he/she is authorized to take cognizance is empowered to postpone the issuance of process against the accused and either (i) enquire into the case; or (ii) direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit. The purpose of postponing the issuance of process for the purposes of an enquiry or an investigation is to determine whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding. However, it is mandatory for the Magistrate to do so in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which the Magistrate exercises jurisdiction. TSection 203 stipulates that if the Magistrate is of the opinion on considering the statement on oath, if any, of the complainant and of the witnesses, and the result of the enquiry or investigation if any under Section 202 that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding, he shall dismiss the complaint recording briefly his reasons for doing so.The requirement of recording reasons which is specifically incorporated in Section 203 does not find place in Section 202. Section 204 which deals with 25 the issuance of process stipulates that if in the opinion of the Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence, there is sufficient ground for proceeding, he may issue (a) in a summons case, a summons for attendance of the accused; (b) in a warrant case, a warrant or if he thinks fit a summons for the appearance of the accused Referring to Re: Expeditious Trial of Cases under Section 138 of N.I. Act 1881 LL 2021 SC 217, the court observed: Section 145 of the NI Act provides that evidence of the complainant may be given by him on affidavit, which shall be read in evidence in an inquiry, trial or other proceeding notwithstanding anything contained in the CrPC. The Constitution Bench held that Section 145 has been inserted in the Act, with effect from 2003 with the laudable object of speeding up trials in complaints filed under Section 138. Hence, the Court noted that if the evidence of the complainant may be given by him on affidavit, there is no reason for insisting on the evidence of the witnesses to be taken on oath. Consequently, it was held that Section 202(2) CrPC is inapplicable to complaints under Section 138 in respect of the examination of witnesses on oath. The Court held that the evidence of witnesses 32 on behalf of the complainant shall be permitted on affidavit. If the Magistrate holds an inquiry himself, it is not compulsory that he should examine witnesses and in suitable cases the Magistrate can examine documents to be satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding under Section 202. The court noted that, in this case, the Magistrate has adverted to: (i) The complaint; (ii) The affidavit filed by the complainant; (iii) The evidence as per evidence list and; and (iv) The submissions of the complainant. The order passed by the Magistrate cannot be held to be invalid as betraying a non-application of mind, the court held.  Also from the judgment: Section 138 NI Act Attracted Even In Cases Where Debt Is Incurred After Cheque Is Drawn But Before Presentation: Supreme Court   Case name: Sunil Todi vs State of Gujarat Case no. and Date: CrA .446 of 2021 | 3 December 2021 Coram: Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna Counsel: Sr.Adv Sidharth Luthra, Sr. Adv Meenakshi Arora for appellants, Sr.Adv Mohit Mathur, Sr. Adv Rebecca John for respondents, Adv Aastha Mehta for state          
The Delhi High Court has issued guidelines to the Investigating Officers to be followed in rape and sexual assault cases where victim's pregnancy exceeds 24 weeks. Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma directed that at the time of medical examination of a victim of sexual assault, it will be mandatory to conduct a “Urine Pregnancy Test”. The court further said that when the victim, who is major and is found pregnant due to sexual assault, expresses her desire for medical termination of pregnancy, the investigating officer will ensure that she is produced before a medical board on the same day. Where a minor victim is carrying pregnancy due to sexual assault, the court directed that she will be produced before the medical board “upon the consent of her legal guardian and desire of such legal guardian for termination of pregnancy.” The court was informed that the medical board stands constituted in four hospitals in Delhi – All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. “In case a minor victim is examined by such Board, appropriate report will be placed before concerned authorities, so that if an order is being sought regarding termination of pregnancy from the Courts, the Court concerned does not lose any more time and is in a position to pass an order on the same expeditiously,” the court added.  The court was also apprised that the medical boards are not available in hospitals in each district which is causing inconvenience to IOs as well as victim. Justice Sharma said that the State Government or Union Territory should ensure that mandate under the MTP Act is complied with and such Boards are constituted in all Government Hospitals having proper MTP centres. The bench also said that it should be mandatory to have such boards constituted beforehand. The court directed Delhi Government’s Health department and Union Ministry for Health Affairs to share the compliance of the directions within two months. The court passed the directions while permitting a 14-year-old minor rape victim to undergo medical termination of pregnancy. She was 25 weeks pregnant when produced before court. Her family members are working as construction workers. After the mother noticed physical changes in her, the minor victim disclosed to her about the sexual assault. Later an FIR was registered under sections 376 and 328 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The medical test of the victim conducted on January 19 showed that she was 24 weeks and 5 days pregnant. After the minor approached court seeking medical termination of pregnancy, a 6-member Medical Board was constituted which opined that the victim was physically and mentally fit to undergo MTP. Permitting the minor victim to undergo termination of pregnancy, the court appreciated the assistance rendered by the Medical Board for conducting the examination and providing its report “within very short period of time of one day.” “This Court further appreciates the efforts of learned counsels for the petitioner as well as State for assisting the Court. The efforts of the Investigating Officer and promptness with which she got the medical examination of the petitioner conducted after registration of FIR is also appreciated,” the court added.  Title: MINOR R THR MOTHER H v. STATE NCT OF DELHI & ANR.    
The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently denied permanent alimony to a wife living in adultery, after a divorce decree was passed on the very ground of such adultery.  The appellant-wife in the case filed an appeal challenging the judgment of the Family Court, Ambala, by which judgment, the Family Court had allowed the divorce petition filed by the respondent-husband under Sections 13(1)(i) and 13(1)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.   The facts leading to the petition were that the appellant and the respondent were legally wedded wife and husband, respectively, since 1989 under the Hindu Marriage Act. The respondent-husband moved a petition for divorce before the Family Court, Ambala, on grounds that the behaviour of his wife was extremely rude and aggressive right from the beginning of their marriage and that his wife used to abuse, insult and humiliate him and his family members, making continuous taunts relating to the respondent's financial condition, also calling him 'Namard' – all of which events made him mentally sick.   Further, the respondent submitted before the Trial Court that his wife had developed intimate relationship with another man (the second respondent), which circumstances led him to leave his house in 2006. It was also on record that his wife and the second respondent used to talk to each other on their mobile phones and that the second respondent used to visit his wife, when the husband used to be away, which was proved by the husband through various witnesses. Accordingly, the respondent husband filed for divorce on grounds of 'cruelty' and 'adultery.'   The Trial Court, based on the averments made by the respondent-husband, granted a decree of divorce under Sections 13(1)(i) and 13(1)(i-b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, affirming both cruelty and adultery as alleged by the husband. In the backdrop of that decree, the appellant-wife raised a permanent alimony claim before the High Court.   The division bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Nidhi Gupta held that the appellant-wife is not entitled to claim permanent alimony from the respondent-husband.   The Court distinguished the facts of the present case from the facts of its decisions in Anil Kumar Sharma v. Asha Sharma, 2014 (36) R.C.R. (Civil) 812 and Delhi High Court's decision in Pradeep Kumar Sharma v. Deepika Sharma, Crl. Rev. P. No. 417 of 2021, noting that in those cases, permanent alimony claim was made after divorce was granted on account of cruelty and not adultery, and therefore there, the wife was entitled to alimony.  Further, the Court also distinguished the facts in Valsarajan v. Saraswathy, 2003(3) R.C.R. (Criminal) 665, a decision of the Kerala High Court relied on by the appellant-wife, from the present facts, by observing that in Valsarajan, the wife was living with another man after divorce, as opposed to the present matter, where the wife was living in adultery before the Trial Court passed a decree for divorce.  Highlighting that since the wife was liable not just for 'cruelty,' but also 'adultery,' the Court dismissed the petition holding that petitioner was not entitled to permanent alimony.

The Karnataka High Court has said that a wife can claim maintenance under two different enactments, particularly after having been granted maintenance under a particular statute.  A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna rejected a petition filed by the husband challenging an order passed by the Family Court granting interim maintenance of Rs.30,000 to his wife under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. He argued that the wife was already in receipt of Rs. 20,000 maintenance in proceedings instituted under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Rejecting this contention, the High Court said,  "The Apex Court in the case of Rajnesh (supra) has clearly observed that in the light of overlapping of jurisdictions, the grant of maintenance under Section 20(1)(d) of the DV Act would be in addition to the maintenance granted under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. and also further holds that there is no bar to seek maintenance both under the DV Act and under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. or under the Hindu Marriage Act or even under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956." The Court clarified that the only rider would be that the amount would not overlap and it would be inclusive of maintenance under each jurisdiction and not exclusive. Coming to the next contention of the petitioner that he has lost his job and is not in a position to maintain his wife, the bench said "A perusal at the order impugned in the petition would clearly indicate that liability statements were placed before the concerned Court and the income of the husband is noticed and the fact that the wife has resigned her job and is residing in Mangalore is also noticed in addition to noticing that the petitioner continues to work in a particular Company at Bangalore. On noticing all these facts maintenance is awarded."  It also refused to hear the contention that the wife has deliberately resigned from her job after initiation of divorce proceedings only to harass the petitioner. It said that this would be a matter of evidence in trial.  Then referring to the apex court judgment in the case of Anju Garg and another v. Deepak Kumar Garg, the High Court reiterated that if the husband is an able bodied man, it is his duty to maintain his wife. It said, "The petitioner continues to work is what is not in dispute as is observed in the impugned order. Therefore, it becomes necessary for the petitioner to maintain his wife, by paying interim maintenance."  Case Title: Uday Nayak v.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has recently observed that a promise to marry, whereby two adults engaged in a physical sexual relationship is a case of courtship and love affair, and by no stretch of the imagination would it come within the definition of Section 375 of IPC [Rape].The Bench of Justice Mohan Lal further ruled that only when there is a case of a false... The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has recently observed that a promise to marry, whereby two adults engaged in a physical sexual relationship is a case of courtship and love affair, and by no stretch of the imagination would it come within the definition of Section 375 of IPC [Rape]. The Bench of Justice Mohan Lal further ruled that only when there is a case of a false promise made with the purpose of obtaining the consent of a woman for sexual favor, the same amounts to misrepresentation and consent so obtained, cannot exonerate a person from criminal liability for the commission of rape. The case in brief Essentially, one Ashok Kumar had moved the Court last year seeking anticipatory bail in a case registered against him for rape as it was alleged that he made sexual relations with the victim many times after obtaining her consentt under the misconception of fact that he would marry her and therefater, he started ignoring her and also threatened her that she would face dire consequences if she ever tried to call him. Earlier, in July 2021, he was granted interim bail by the High Corut with the directions that he would appear before the Investigating Officer and shall not contact with any prosecution witness.  However, in September 2021, the counsel for complainant/prosecutrix filed an application for cancellation/revocation of interim bail granted to him on the ground that he was continuously harassing and threatening the prosecutrix after the grant of bail. It was also alleged that the applicant/accused came at the residence of the prosecutrix and threatened her of dire consequences and pressurized her and other family members to withdraw the FIR. Court's observations  The Court persued the contents of the FIR lodged against the bail applicant and noted that there was not an iota of whisper that applicant/accused had made false promise or the applicant/accused had engaged in sexual relations with the victim on the basis of the false promise.  "There is also no allegation in FIR that when applicant/accused promised to marry the complainant/victim, it was done in bad faith or with intention to deceive her. From the contents of FIR, it appears that there is a failure on the part of applicant/accused to fulfill his promise of marriage made in the year 2017 which he could not fulfill in 2021," the Court further noted. Further, the Court observed that when there was no allegation in the FIR that the promise made by the accused was false, the physical relationship of the accused with the victim does not amount to offence of rape within the meaning of Section 375 of IPC. The Court also took into account significant rulings of the Supreme Court on when 'False promise of marriage amounts to rape' including J&K High Court's ruling in the case of Tanveer Iqbal vs State and others 2018 (2) Crimes (HC) 264, wherein it was observed thus: "...when there is a long duration of consensual physical relation between the two under the pretext or promise that the accused will marry her but now backed out and it has not been alleged even by the prosecutrix that false promise of marriage was made for establishing physical relation, it is thus simply a case of courtship and consensual physical relation between the two grownup which even did not end up tying nuptial knot is not a case of commission of rape." Against this backdrop, having regard to the facts of the case, the Court held that there was no false promise to marriage made by the Applicant-accsued to complainant/prosecutrix in the instant case.  "Contents of FIR demonstrates that applicant/accused though has agreed to marry the prosecutrix and both of them were involved in physical sexual relations and it is thus simply a case of courtship and consensual physical relation which in my considered view does not amount to commission of rape," the Court further remarked. Consequently, the anticipatory bail granted to applicant/accused in July 2021 was made absolute subject to the conditions that applicant/accused, if required by the investigating agency, shall appear before the Investigating Officer during the course of investigation and shall not threaten or intimidate any prosecution witnesses.

"Not pressing the criminal appeal after the conviction of the accused by the court below is like the confession of the offence by the accused," the Allahabad High Court observed recently as it upheld the conviction of a man under Section 354 IPC [Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty]. The Bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Gupta however reduced the sentence of the convict to the period of imprisonment already undergone by him (about 8 months).  It may be noted that the incident dates back to the year 2007 when an offence under Section 354 IPC entailed 2 years of imprisonment or a fine or both, however, subsequent to an amendment made in the IPC in the year 2013, now, this offence carries 5 years of imprisonment along with a fine. Convict-Ramsagar moved to the High Court challenging the impugned judgment and order passed by Additional District & Sessions Judge/FTC Lakhimpur Kheri. Initially, the Convict argued that the trial court, without appreciating the evidence available on record, wrongly convicted him. He also contended that both the witnesses examined by the prosecution is the interested witnesses and no independent witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution.  However, his counsel later on submitted that the appellant does not want to argue the appeal on merits and he only wants to advance submission on the quantum of sentence imposed upon him. In view of this submission, the Bench stressed that not pressing the criminal appeal after the conviction of the accused by the court below is like the confession of the offence by the accused. The Court further observed thus: "Generally, the Courts take lenient view in the matter of awarding sentence to an accused in criminal trial, where he voluntarily confesses his guilt, unless the facts of the case warrants severe sentence" The Court further underscored that appropriate sentence is the cry of the society and therefore, the Court added, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the 6 nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed. Against this backdrop, considering the entire possible conspectus of circumstances, the Court opined that sending the convict back to penitentiary, to serve out remaining part of his sentence wouldn't be in the interest of justice.  "Fear of being sending back to jail looming large for such long period must have tormented him enough for which he must have been penancing," the Court said as it upheld conviction under Section 354 IPC, but his sentence was reduced to the period of imprisonment already undergone by him. In view of the above, the appeal on the point of conviction was dismissed and on the point of sentence, was partly allowed.  Case title - Ramsagar v. State of U.P.

The Kerala High Court on Friday allowed advocates and their clerks to travel to Courts during the lockdown, if physical sittings are notified, provided they carry an undertaking in the prescribed format with identity cards. "The State Police Chief is directed to instruct all police officers that lawyers are to be given essential access to the courts because otherwise it will be the common man who will be the sufferer, particularly in criminal matters", the Court ordered. Additionally, the Bench allowed for access to advocate offices in emergencies upon verification of credentials by the police officer concerned. "Of course, in exceptional circumstances if the lawyer requires access to office also, it will be up to the police officer to verify credentials and take a decision if such an access be allowed A Division Bench of Justices Devan Ramachandran and Dr Kauser Edappagath heard public interest litigation petitions initiated by a lawyer named Melwin Byju, through Advocate G Sreekumar (Chelur) and the All India Jurists Association. Advocate Byju prayed for allowances on movement amid the restrictions imposed in Kerala to curtail the spread of Covid-19 while the Association sought  declaration that advocates and advocate clerks provide 'essential services' . Kerala is going into lockdown from May 8 to May 16. When Advocate Byju's petition was last taken up, the State Police Chief had assured the Kerala High Court that advocates and their clerks will be allowed to move to and from their offices, courts, another other legal fora amid restrictions imposed on movement in the wake of the spike in COVID-19 cases in the State of Kerala. Advocates would not be exempt from checking, but would be allowed movement upon production of identity documents and on disclosing where they were headed, the State had submitted on that occasion. In its Order today, the Court directed that the undertaking would continue if there was no complete lockdown. In the event there was a complete lockdown on movement or similar measures, the Court ruled that Advocates and their clerks will be permitted to travel to courts if physical sittings are notified, provided they carry an undertaking in a prescribed format as also their identity cards. "The State Police Chief is directed to instruct all police officers that lawyers are to be given essential access to the courts because otherwise it will be the common man who will be the sufferer, particularly in criminal matters."  During the hearing today, Advocate John Mani V, appearing for the All India Jurists' Association, sought for a declaration that advocate services be deemed as essential services and that their movement to and from offices be allowed in this light. Advocate G Sreekumar for Advocate Melwin Byju, Advocate Thomas Abraham for the Bar Association, and Advocate Rajit for the Kerala Bar Council sought exceptions to the restrictions imposed, insofar as movement to courts and offices were concerned. Senior Government Pleader Suman Chakravarthy stated that allowing movement during a complete lockdown would be difficult, but indicated his assent to the Court's suggestions.  The Court declined to grant the prayer seeking a declaration of lawyers as essential services, noting that it was a policy decision by the government, accepting the Senior Government Pleader Suman Chakravarthy's stance in this respect. The Jurists Association was allowed liberty to approach the government with their representations in this respect.    
The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) recently ruled that a party seeking a scientific expert's attendance under Section 311 of CrPC needs to plead with accuracy and precision as to why the expert witness must be summoned before the court.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) recently ruled that a party seeking a scientific expert's attendance under Section 311 of CrPC needs to plead with accuracy and precision as to why the expert witness must be summoned before the court.  This assertion came from the Bench of Justice Sujoy Paul and Justice Pranay Verma as it stressed that for invoking power under Section 311 of CrPC, it has to be determined by the Presiding Judge (in the facts of each case) whether new evidence is essential to the just decision of a case or not.  Essentially, Section 311 of the Cr.P.C deals with the Power of Court to summon material witness or examine person present.   It states the following:  "Any Court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceedings under this Code, summon any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall and reexamine any person already examined; and the Court shall summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of the case."  Referring to Section 311 of CrPC, the Court noted that this Section is in two parts. In the first part, the word "may" is employed, and in the second part uses "shall", meaning thereby, the first part gives pure discretion to the criminal court whereas the second part makes it mandatory to summon the witness.   "The litmus test to exercise power under the second part aforesaid is whether it is essential to the just decision of a case to summon the witnesses. Whether new evidence is essential or not depends on the facts and circumstances of each case which needs to be determined by the presiding Judge," the court further held, referring to Apex court's ruling in the case of Zahira Habibullah Sheikh and Anr Vs. State of Gujarat and Ors reported in (2006) 3 SCC 374.  The facts in brief  The Petitioner, one Arun Kumar Dey, is facing prosecution under Section 7, 13(1) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act as allegedly, while working as Manager of District Industries Centre at Ujjain, he had received illegal gratification for executing lease deed in favor of the complainant.   It was alleged that the petitioner demanded an illegal gratification which resulted in a trap in which the petitioner's hands, pocket, and pants were washed in Sodium Carbonate solution which turned pink.   Bottles in which washings were kept, were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Rau, District – Indore for analysis. In turn, Scientific Officer submitted the report which was filed before the Court below.   On the basis of deposition of prosecution witnesses, the petitioner noticed certain discrepancies and thought it proper to file an application under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. for calling the scientific expert for cross-examination.   However, the Court below dismissed the said application, and challenging the same, he moved the High Court while filing a 482 CrPC plea.  It was argued before the High Court by the petitioner that unless expert/scientific expert is put to cross-examination by summoning him in the exercise of power under section 311 of the Cr. P.C, the applicant will not be able to demolish the case of the prosecution and put forth his defense in an effective manner.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the power flowing from the second part of section 311 of the Cr. P.C cannot be exercised on mere asking.   "Merely because it is pleaded that 'in the interest of justice' and 'for lawful adjudication of matter,' scientific expert should be summoned, it was not obligatory on the part of Special Judge to summon the said witness unless it is established with accuracy and precision that the new evidence is essential in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case," the Court held.  Considering the facts of the case, the Court observed that the application of the petitioner did not contain sufficient pleadings and reasons on the strength of which the power under section 311 of the Cr. P.C could have been exercised by the Court below.  "In the instant case, since the petitioner has miserably failed to establish necessary ingredients for invoking power under section 311 of the Cr.P.C, we are unable to hold that the Court below has passed the order either with material irregularity or illegality. Hence, no case is made out for interference," the Court held as it dismissed the 482 plea filed by the petitioner.  Case title - Arun Kumar Dey v.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered a CBI investigation into the Hanshkhali gangrape and murder case.According to reports, a 14-year-old girl belonging to the scheduled caste community died on April 5 after she was allegedly gangraped by the son of a panchayat member owing allegiance to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and others in West Bengal's Nadia district. She was bleeding profusely... The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered a CBI investigation into the Hanshkhali gangrape and murder case. According to reports, a 14-year-old girl belonging to the scheduled caste community died on April 5 after she was allegedly gangraped by the son of a panchayat member owing allegiance to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and others in West Bengal's Nadia district. She was bleeding profusely when she returned home and died later that night, according to her parents who lodged a police complaint on April 10. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) had been filed before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj wherein it had been alleged that on April 4, the deceased minor girl had been invited in the birthday party by one Brijgopal Goalain, Shyamnagar area in Hanshkhali in Nadia district of West Bengal, who is stated to be the son of an influential political leader of the ruling Trinamool Congress Party (TMC) and a member of Gazna Gram Panchayat. It was further alleged that the deceased was gang raped by Brijgopal Goalain with 4-5 other friends.  Perusing the records, the Court noted that the deceased girl had been sent back to her house around 8pm in a sick condition and that she was bleeding from her private parts and was smelling of alcohol. It was also alleged that the family members were prevented from taking her to any private or government hospital and that the victim minor girl had died on account of excessive bleeding from the private parts. Opining that a fair investigation is required to instil confidence in the family members of the victim and also the residents of the locality and the State, the Court underscored,  "..we are of the opinion that in order to have fair investigation in the matter and to instill confidence in the family members of the victim and also the residents of the locality and the State, the investigation should be carried out by the CBI instead of the local police. Hence, we direct the State Investigating Agency to hand over the investigation to the CBI with immediate effect. The State Investigating Agency will hand over all the papers relating to the investigation along with the custody of the accused persons to the CBI forthwith." The concerned authorities were also ordered to extend full protection to the family members of the victim and witnesses of the case. The CBI was ordered to furnish a report about the progress of investigation on the next date of hearing which is slated to take place on May 2.  Pursuant to the perusal of the case diary, the Court further observed that the investigation suffers from serious lapses on several important aspects. The Bench further opined that they cannot lose sight of the fact that the accused is the son of a powerful leader of the ruling party and that there is material available in the case diary indicating that the family members of the victim have been threatened. "The fact that there is no MLC, no post-mortem report and no death certificate also creates a suspicion about an attempt to suppress the entire incident and to wipe out the evidence", the Court observed further.  The Court also dismissed the contention of the State that there is no death certificate because there is no crematorium in the village by opining that such a contention is incorrect as the case diary shows that the victim was cremated in Shyamnagar Atirpur Burning Ghat (Shamsan). The case diary further reflects that the rape may have been committed upon the victim not only by the person named in the FIR but by other persons also, it was noted further.  It may be noted that the Court has recently handed over to the CBI the investigation into the violence in Birbhum district of West Bengal in which 8 persons were killed in retaliation to the murder of local TMC leader Bhadu Sheikh. The investigation into the murder of Sheikh was also transferred to the CBI.  According to reports, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday had cast doubts about the details of the gangrape-murder asking whether the teenager was raped or was she already pregnant. Speaking in the presence of West Bengal police chief Manoj Malaviya at an event in Kolkata, the Chief Minister reportedly claimed that the girl was having an affair with the accused, and alleged that the Opposition parties and media were giving a "political twist" to the incident. Her remarks attracted sharp criticism from the Opposition parties.  Case Title: Shaista Afreen and Others v. The State of West Bengal and Others    
The Delhi High Court has refused to grant any interim relief to a third year law student, who was debarred from appearing in V-semester examinations by Campus Law Centre, Delhi University. "The father of the Petitioner, who is present during the hearing, has expressed his dismay and urges the Court to take a lenient view considering the fact that the decision of the University would prolong Petitioner’s course and result in wastage of six precious months. The Court, however, remains unconvinced as the Petitioner has attended classes sporadically throughout the semester, and the minimum attendance criteria is a requirement which cannot be glossed over," said the court. A vacation bench of Justice Sanjeev Narula issued notice on the law student’s plea seeking deletion of his name from the detention lists dated December 30 and 31, 2022 and permission to appear in the V semester examination commencing from January 3 to 14, 2023. It was the petitioner’s case that he had fractured his hand on November 4, 2022 while playing football and was advised complete bed rest from November 16 to December 16, 2022 due to which he could not meet the minimum attendance criteria for appearing in the V semester examination. However, his explanation was not considered by the University and he was debarred from attending the exams. The counsel appearing for the varsity, on instructions, apprised the court that the petitioner’s attendance was only 46.94% as against minimum requirement of 70%. He added that even if the student is given benefit of one month period for which he was purportedly recommended to take bed rest, he would get benefit of 40 lectures which would still be falling short of the minimum requirement. The court in the order noted that the medical document produced by the student was issued on December 30, 2022. "However, whether there was indeed such medical advice given is not discernible from the medical prescriptions of the same doctor (Dr. Dhir) dated 15th November, 2022 and 07th December, 2022. Mr. Gahlaut [petitioner's counsel] is also unable to point out any document advising “bed rest” except for the above ex-post facto certificate," said the court. Noting that the petitioner had attended only 123 out of 262 lectures, Justice Narula observed that the medical ground also is of no avail to him. The court also observed that as per a decision of a coordinate bench in Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University v. Naincy Sagar and Anr, the attendance of a minimum percentage of classes prescribed in professional courses such as LL.B. is non-negotiable. “Importance of attending lectures for imbibing the syllabus/curriculum in a given semester, the most efficient way of learning, must be underscored. Further, Mr. Gaulaut has submitted that minimum number of classes, as required by Bar Council of India, have not been held by the University. This remains a lone submission sans any reference in the plaint and unsubstantiated by any document shown to the Court. University shall deal with the same in the counter affidavit,” the court said while denying interim relief.  The matter will now be heard on February 17.  Title: ARJUN ANAND v. UNIVERSITY OF DELHI & ORS.    
The Gujarat High Court while allowing the petition against the order of detention of the Petitioner has held that offences under Section 27 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Sections 30 and 35 of the Gujarat Medical Practitioner Act by itself cannot bring the detenu within the fold of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, 1985.  The detenu had contested that illegal activity likely to be carried out or alleged to have been carried out could not have any nexus or bearing with the maintenance of public order and at the most, it could be said to be a breach of law and order. It could not be said that the activities of the detenu had 'affected the tempo of the society' or caused threat to the very existence of the normal and routine life of the people at large. The activities did not disrupt the rule of law by disturbing public order.  Per contra, the AGP supported the detention by submitting that the detenu was in the habit of indulging in such activities and thus his activities could be brought under Section 2(c) of the Anti-Social Activities Act.   Justice S Vora and Justice Sandeep Bhatt opined that the detention cannot be legal, valid and in accordance with law since the offences registered against the detenu could be dealt with under the provisions of the relevant penal laws and the relevant legislation. The Bench remarked:  "Unless and until, the material is there to make out a case that the person has become a threat and menace to the Society so as to disturb the whole tempo of the society and that all social apparatus is in peril disturbing public order at the instance of such person, it cannot be said that the detenue is a person within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Act."  There was no evidence on record to show that the acts of the detune had disturbed the whole tempo of the society or disrupted public order as within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the Act, per the Bench. Reference was made to Pushker Mukherjee v/s. State of West Bengal [AIR 1970 SC 852] to provide the distinction between 'law and order' and 'public order':  "In this connection we must draw a line of demarcation between serious and aggravated forms of disorder which directly affect the community or injure the public interest and the relatively minor breaches of peace of a purely local significance which primarily injure specific individuals and only in a secondary sense public interest. A mere disturbance of law and order leading to disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for action under the Preventive Detention Act but a disturbance which will affect public order comes within the scope of the Act."  Accordingly, the petition was allowed and the order of detention was quashed.   Case Title: SUBHASHCHANDRA SANATAN MALLIK THROUGH BABITA SUBHASHCHANDRA MALLIK v/s STATE OF GUJARAT     
The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently ruled that the Executing Court cannot appoint Advocate Commissioner in execution proceedings after the trial court has already decided the question of possession of property.Justice R. Raghunandan Rao observed,"In the present case, the trial Court of competent jurisdiction has already decided the question of possession of the property in favour of... The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently ruled that the Executing Court cannot appoint Advocate Commissioner in execution proceedings after the trial court has already decided the question of possession of property. Justice R. Raghunandan Rao observed, "In the present case, the trial Court of competent jurisdiction has already decided the question of possession of the property in favour of the petitioner herein. This finding cannot be over turned by the Executing Court while passing orders in an Execution Petition. The Executing Court ought not to have directed the appointment of an advocate commissioner in such a circumstance."  Brief Facts of the case  The petitioner had filed a suit against respondent for grant of permanent injunction restraining them from interfering with the possession of petitioner over the suit schedule property.  The case of the petitioner was accepted by the trial court as the petitioner proved is title and possession. After disposal of suit, the petitioner filed Execution Petition on the ground that the respondent was seeking to violate the orders of the Trial Court. The respondent moved Execution Appeal for appointment of advocate commissioner to note down the physical features of the property.  It was the contention of the respondent that as the petitioner was never in possession of the schedule property and as the judgment and decree was obtained by petitioner by suppressing true facts, the appointment of an advocate commissioner to inspect the schedule property by noting down the physical features and taking photographs of the same would be important for the Court of Justice.  The petitioner contended that the respondent had already filed photographs of the schedule property to prove his case and appointment of advocate commissioner is not necessary as it will protract the litigation.  The Executing Court allowed the application to appoint an advocate commissioner for a just determination of the case. Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has filed the civil revision petition.  Contentions of both sides  Advocate Nuthalapati Krishna Murthy, counsel for the petitioner contended that appointment of advocate commissioner at the stage of execution is effectively an application for adducing fresh evidence to overturn the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court. He contended that Executing Court cannot go behind the decree or arrive at findings which are at odds with the decree.   Advocate C. Subodh counsel for the respondent contended that there will be no harm caused to the petitioner if the advocate commissioner is appointed to note down the physical features of the property.   Court's observations  The court observed that the trial court has already decided the question of possession of the property in favour of petitioner. The finding cannot be over turned by Executing Court while passing orders in Execution Petition. Furthermore, the Executing Court has not pointed out the ambiguity which needs to be clarified before the trial court through appointment of advocate commissioner.   On the basis of the aforementioned observation, it was held that the Executing Court could not have directed the appointment of an advocate commissioner. The Civil Revision Petition was thus allowed.   Case Title: M Rama Chandraiah Versus Valleupu China Ankaiah    
Observing that the legislative intent behind Section 540 of J&K CrPC (pari materia with Section 311 of CrPC) is to ensure there is no failure of justice due to the mistake of either party in bringing the valuable evidence on record, the J&K&L High court recently set aside an order of the trial court in terms of which it had disallowed the petitioner to examine certain witnesses. A bench comprising Justice Sanjay Dhar observed,  "A Court may, in its discretion, summon and examine any person as a witness who has not been summoned as a witness or recall/re-examine any person already examined and in case evidence of such person appears to the Court essential to the just decision of the case, it is the bounden duty of the Court to exercise its power under this provision". The petitioner, also the complainant, had impugned the trial court order to the extent it only partly allowed his prayer and permitted examination of only one out of five prosecution witness. According to the petitioner, all these witnesses were acquainted with the facts of the case and were present on spot when the occurrence took place. Justice Dhar observed that a bare perusal of Section 540 clearly suggests that there exists no limitation on the power of the Court, at any stage to which the trial may have reached, for summoning and examining any witness. "The expressions used in the provision are “any person" and at "any stage" of any enquiry, trial or other proceedings” which means that the court has unfettered powers to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 540 of J&K Cr. P. C at any stage of the proceedings, even after the conclusion of the trial before passing of the final judgment", the bench underscored. Explaining the finer details of the provision and its essence to the criminal procedure the court observed that Section 540 CrPC comprise of two parts, while the first part is discretionary in nature the second part is mandatory and thus a Court may, in its discretion, summon and examine any person as a witness who has not been summoned as a witness or recall/re-examine any person already examined. Doing so ensures that the court does not miss an important witness because of any laxity from the parties, the bench maintained. In the case at hand, the Court noted that trial court had not assigned any reason for declining the application and evidently, examination of two of the four remaining witnesses was essential to the just decision of the case. Accordingly the bench partly set aside the order of the trial court and directed it to to summon and examine the two witnesses and conclude the trial of the case expeditiously, preferably within two months. The Court also disagreed with the contention of respondent's counsel Adv Azim Pandith that the petitioner had no right to file an application or to intermeddle on behalf of the prosecution as it is only the Public Prosecutor who is vested with power to conduct the prosecution. It observed that since the application filed by the complainant was adopted by the prosecution, it implies that the application has been virtually filed on behalf of the prosecution.

In a significant judgment, the Jharkhand High Court has held that Family Courts cannot turn away parties seeking divorce under their customary laws.A Division Bench comprising of Justices Aparesh Kumar Singh and Anubha Rawat Choudhary has held, "The Family Court fell in error in holding that the suit is not maintainable in absence of codified substantive law as are applicable... In a significant judgment, the Jharkhand High Court has held that Family Courts cannot turn away parties seeking divorce under their customary laws. A Division Bench comprising of Justices Aparesh Kumar Singh and Anubha Rawat Choudhary has held,  "The Family Court fell in error in holding that the suit is not maintainable in absence of codified substantive law as are applicable to the parties…whether the parties are able to plead and prove the custom governing the matters of divorce between them for seeking relief was an issue to be decided on merits after considering the pleadings and evidence on record."  The Court emphasized that the Family Courts Act, 1984 is a secular law applying to all religions. Section 7 thereof relates to Jurisdiction of Family Courts and sub-section (1)(A) of the provision confers on them "all the jurisdiction" hitherto exercised by any District Court in suits or proceedings relating marriage, divorce, etc.  Thus, it is held that there is no precedent which bars members of the Scheduled Tribe to approach the Family Court by filing any suit or proceedings relating to matters mentioned in Section 7 of the Family Courts Act.  The order further states,  "If at all, such matter is filed, seeking adjudication under the law, applicable to them, i.e. Customary Laws, they cannot resort to the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, if the parties are not governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955."  Background  The Court was hearing an appeal against an order of the Family Court, Ranchi dismissing a suit for Divorce filed by the Appellant-husband, a member of the Oraon community, on the ground of adultery, as non-maintainable.  The Family Court referred to the book "The Customary Laws of the Munda and the Oraon" and held that there is no substantive codified law, applicable to the parties.  It further took note of Section 2(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 which makes the Act inapplicable to the members of any Schedule Tribe within the meaning of Article 366 of the Constitution of India, unless notified by the Central Government.  Thus, it was held that since the Appellant is seeking divorce on the basis of the customs and usage applicable to the parties, the petition is not maintainable and the same may be adjudicated only by the Community Panchayat, and not by a Court of Law.  Submissions  Amicus Curiae Kumar Vaibhav and Shubhashis Rasik Soren submitted that even customs and usage cannot impede rights of a citizen to approach the Court of Law, i.e. a family court seeking divorce.  It was contended that if at all a custom forbids access to Family Court and relegates a person seeking divorce to Panchayat/Community court, the same will be violative of right to access to justice and any sanctification of customs, resulting in violation of fundamental rights ought not be resorted to.  Findings  At the outset, the Division Bench observed that ouster of jurisdiction should not be readily inferred [Bhanwar Lal & Anr. v. Rajasthan Board of Muslim Wakf & Ors., (2014) 16 SCC 51].  It observed that the use of the words 'all the jurisdiction' in Section 7 of the Family Courts Act makes the legislative intent clear that all the enumerate matters in the provision would be the exclusive domain of the Family Courts.  Reliance was placed on the Supreme Court's observations in KA Abdul Jaleel v. TA Shahida, (2003) 4 SCC 166, that jurisdiction of a court created especially for resolution of disputes of certain kinds should be construed liberally.  "FCA created a forum for adjudication of matrimonial matters of the nature enumerated in the explanation to Section 7 of the FCA, which forum can be resorted to by one and all, be it a member of scheduled tribe or a person of any religion," the Division Bench ruled.  Jurisdictional Facts & Adjudicatory Facts  The Division Bench went ahead to discuss the concept of 'Jurisdictional Facts' and 'Adjudicatory Facts'.   The facts or facts upon which the jurisdiction of a Court, a Tribunal or an Authority depends can be said to be 'Jurisdictional Fact'. If the 'Jurisdictional Fact' exists, a Court, Tribunal or Authority has jurisdiction to decide other issues.  An 'Adjudicatory Fact' is a 'fact in issue' and can be determined by a Court, Tribunal or Authority on merits, on the basis of the evidence, adduced by the parties. Such facts may be decided based upon the pleadings of the parties.  In the present case, the Bench explained, the underlying jurisdictional fact as pleaded before the Family Court, is that both the parties belonged to Oraon Community and their marriage was solemnized as per the Customary Law of Oraon.   "The Family Court Act, being a secular law, applying to all religions and communities and conferred with the power to adjudicate on matters mentioned in Clauses (a) to (g) of the Explanation to Section 7 of the FCA, could not have held that the suit is not maintainable in the absence of a codified Customary Law of the parties," the Bench observed.  It added,  "Family Court would not have straightaway dismissed the suit as not maintainable holding that there is no codified substantive law, governing the parties. In such a case, where parties claimed to be governed by Customary Law, the learned Family Court ought to have framed an issue to that effect. Once it is found that the parties are governed by the Customary Law, the parties are required to plead and prove the customs, by which, they are governed in matters concerning, marriage and divorce."

Underscoring that the Right To Property is a Constitutional Right that has been acknowledged to be akin to a fundamental right and a basic human right, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently directed the J&K Government to pay 10 Lakh as compensation to the petitioners in a case of illegal deprivation of land.Ordering thus, the Bench of Chief Justice Pankaj Mithal... Underscoring that the Right To Property is a Constitutional Right that has been acknowledged to be akin to a fundamental right and a basic human right, the Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently directed the J&K Government to pay 10 Lakh as compensation to the petitioners in a case of illegal deprivation of land. Ordering thus, the Bench of Chief Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Javed Iqbal Wani further stressed that no one can be deprived of his property without following the procedure prescribed in law and payment of adequate compensation. The case in brief Essentially, the bench was dealing with the plea of one Krishan Singh and another who were the owners of a piece of land with nine walnut trees in Village Batroo, Tehsil Pogal Paristan (Ukhral) in District Ramban, and the same was utilized by the Government in the year 2012-13 for the construction of a multi-purpose community hall. It was their plea that the acquisition of the aforesaid land was without any lawful authority and no consent of the petitioners was taken to use it and that the petitioners were not even paid any compensation. It was their further plea that to date no declaration under Section 6 of the State Land Acquisition Act, 1990 had been issued and published with regard to the acquisition of the property. On the other hand, the respondents contended that the matter regarding completion of acquisition proceedings stands submitted to the Government and they would be paying the compensation once the proceedings are complete and the final award is pronounced.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the Right to Property/Land used to be a fundamental right but now it has been recognized as a constitutional right vide Article 300A of the Constitution of India. The Court further observed that the proceedings for acquisition of any land commence with the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act proposing to acquire the land for a public purpose and once the Government is satisfied on consideration of the report of the Collector that the land is needed for a public purpose, it directs for issuance of a declaration under Section 6 of the Act.  Further, noting that in the instant case, to date no declaration under Section 6 of the Act has been issued and published, meaning thereby that the land has not been finally acquired and there is simply a proposal to acquire the said land, the Court concluded thus: "In such circumstances, when the land has not been finally acquired, the respondents could not have taken possession of the said land and utilized it for construction purposes. The action of the respondents in constructing a community hall on the land in question without waiting for the final acquisition of land and in the absence of the invocation of the urgency clause, is nothing but an abuse of the process of law depriving the petitioners from their valuable right to possess property." Agaisnt this backdrop, the Court directed the respondents to forthwith distribute the estimated cost of acquisition of the aforesaid land which has been worked out to be ₹15,00,000/- within a period of one month. Lastly, the Court ordered a compensation of 10 lakh and directed the respondents to conclude the acquisition proceedings by issuing a declaration under Section 6 of the Act and pronouncing the final award within a period of three months. Case title - Krishan Singh and another v. State and others   
The Punjab and Haryana High Court has rejected a husband's petition seeking appointment of a Local Commissioner in divorce proceedings for getting expert opinion with regard to an illness of his wife. Justice Manjari Nehru Kaul said it is trite law that a party cannot be allowed to collect evidence through the court. "Each party has to lead evidence in support of its case and it cannot be allowed to lean on the Courts for the same. Furthermore, the Local Commissioner cannot be permitted to perform medical test upon the respondent without her consent as it would without a doubt amount to violation of her right to privacy."  The court made the observations while dismissing the revision petition filed by the petitioner-husband. The Family Court in Jalandhar had dismissed his application in July 2022. The petitioner then filed the revision under Article 227 of the Constitution against the order passed by the Additional Principal Judge. In relation to the case filed under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the petitioner had argued that his wife was suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis even prior to their marriage and concealment of the health condition amounted to cruelty.  His argument was that to prove the fact she had the illness even prior to the marriage, the appointment of the Local Commissioner was essential for an expert opinion regarding the origin or history of the disease. The same would be necessary for the just and effective adjudication of the application under HMA, his counsel argued. Regarding the maintainability of the petition, the counsel contended that the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India was wider than the revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code, and therefore, the writ was maintainable. Reliance was placed on the Supreme Court decisions in K.P. Natarajan and Others v. Muthalammal and Others, SLP (C) 2492 of 2021 and Radhey Shyam and Others v. Chhabi Nath and Others, Civil Appeal No. 2548 of 2009. It was argued that the petitioner has a right to prove his case by leading cogent evidence and hence, the appointment of the Local Commissioner would be necessary, "which fact has been erroneously ignored by the learned Family Court while passing the impugned order." Justice Kaul placed reliance on the decision in Pritam Singh v. Sunder Lal, 1990 (2) PLR 191, where it was held that a revision against an order refusing to appoint a Local Commissioner did not lie as it was the discretion of the Court to appoint a commissioner and and in case the Court refuses to appoint a commission, then, no right of any party can be said to have been prejudiced. "The case laws relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner would not come to his rescue as in the present case, the impugned order refusing the appointment of the Local Commissioner, neither any issue has been decided, nor the rights of the parties adjudicated. Hence, the impugned order is not revisable."  Dismissing the plea, the court said the petition is without merits and that it is not inclined to invoke its revisional jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Case Title: Vishal Vashisht v. Nitasha Sharma Coram: Justice Manjari Nehru Kaul   
The Petitioner was a minor when the FIR was registered. The court said he cannot claim protection under JJ Act as on the second occasion he "had admittedly attained majority and was gainfully under the services of BSF. "The Delhi High Court has upheld a dismissal order passed against a man, who was appointed as a constable in the Border Security Force (BSF), over "non-disclosure and wrong disclosure" of an FIR registered against him when he was a minor.  A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Saurabh Banerjee said the petitioner had been giving false information since the very beginning — when he filled the form at the time of applying for the post in BSF, when he was yet to commence his training and thereafter once again when he gave a reply to the show cause notice after joining. The court said it finds it extremely hard to believe that he was unaware of the FIR or the proceedings emanating therefrom as he certainly would have been a party to those at every stage.  "This does not behove good of any prudent civilian like, the petitioner, while filling up the Form while applying for a job in a coveted Force-BSF. This also does not behove good of any prudent Armed Forces personnel like the petitioner while replying to the Show Cause Notice when he was already a part of the coveted Force-BSF. Nobody, especially the petitioner, at any stage i.e., at the time of joining or after joining the Armed Forces can be allowed to make such mistake(s). The same are not only detrimental but also contrary to the expected norms," the bench said.  The court said the petitioner is guilty of committing a blunder, not once, but twice and such acts are not pardonable in the armed forces. It further said that the phraseology used by petitioner in his reply to the show cause notice was "scathing and loaded with falsities." The Case According to the petitioner, he was falsely implicated in the FIR when he was a minor.  When he applied for the post of Constable in the BSF, he did not disclose about FIR. He was appointed and complete the training. During the course of verification, the BSF came to know about it and issued him a showcause notice on February 4, 2012. His reply was not found satisfactory and he was dismissed form service without any pensionary benefits on February 18 in 2012. His appeal was dismissed by the appellate authority on March 7, 2016. It was the case of the petitioner that there was no need for him to disclose information regarding the FIR as there is a specific bar under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000. On the other hand, it was submitted on behalf of the respondent authorities that at the time of filing the Attestation & Enrolment Form, the petitioner had given false information as he did not disclose about the FIR and thereafter gave an unsatisfactory response to the Show Cause Notice.  JJ Act Protection The court said the position of law qua a juvenile is well laid out in the Act, which is a benevolent piece of legislation primarily enacted to do away with the stigma attached to a juvenile in conflict with law.  "A reading of Section 19(1) of the Act bears out that the same is a safe-guarding provision which specifically enumerates that even if a juvenile, after committing any offence, has been held guilty and punished/arrested/convicted under any other law(s) by any Court of law, the same will be nugatory and have no-effect. So much so, Section 19(2) of the Act mandates the Board to remove the relevant records of such conviction at the relevant stage as stated as per the prescribed rules. Similarly, Section 21 of the Act casts a prohibition of publication of details of a juvenile as no report of any kind of any inquiry regarding such juvenile, in conflict with law or one who is in need of care and protection under the Act is to be disclosed."  The court said the position of law only solves the issue qua non-disclosure of pendency of FIR by the petitioner while applying for the post. "However, the Order dated 18.02.2012 was passed by the respondents after "Considering the matter in its entirety… …", which included the petitioner supplying information false to his own knowledge on two occasions," it added. The court noted that the case of respondents is qua non-disclosure and also qua supplying false information of the FIR by the petitioner. Though the petitioner has protection by virtue of the Act for non-disclosure but "but, in our view, he cannot claim any protection for supplying false information twice". Continuing, the court said, "...as the petitioner on the second occasion had admittedly attained majority and was gainfully under the services of BSF". "Without going into the merit or the status of the FIR, the petitioner was duty-bound to truthfully apprise the respondents about the actual true status thereof. Having not done so, the petitioner is grossly guilty of both withholding and for divulging wrong fact about the FIR on more than one occasion. Such a statement and the act(s) twice do not behove of a soldier, especially the one who is on the verge of joining BSF," the bench said. The court said the acts of the petitioners will make it difficult for the authorities to exude confidence upon him "as he is guilty of acting detrimental to the interest of respondents on the very threshold". Ruling that the authorities rightly proceeded against the petitioner, the court said though the petitioner was a minor at the time of committing the act but he had attained the age of majority when he made the false statements and "that too when he was in the services of BSF, twice over again". "The petitioner was, thus, rightly held guilty of non-disclosure and wrong disclosure," said the court.  Advocates Jitendra Kumar Singh and Anjali Kumari appeared for the petitioner. Advocates Vikrant N. Goyal, Ajay Singh, Shikhar Sardana, Ankita Sarangi appeared for respondents.  Title: ANIL KUMAR v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS.    
The Supreme Court observed that any fault or shortcoming on the part of the staff of the Subordinate Court or any delay in compliance by the Court are not by itself a reason to transfer a case. In this case, the Allahabad High Court transferred a criminal case from the Court of Additional Sessions Judge First, Aligarh to the corresponding Court at Mathura. This was because the High Court felt dissatisfied with the conduct of the staff of the Subordinate Court in not taking on record an order passed by it. Transfer petitions were filed by some accused persons who contended that the discharge application moved by some of the accused persons was not being decided and they were asked to appear before the Court at Aligarh on every date. The High Court even asked the Trial Judge to appear in-person and submit apology. While considering the appeal filed against this order, the bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose observed:  "In the totality of circumstances of the case, we do not wish to make any comments on the nature of proceedings this matter has undergone but, we are clearly of the view that because of any fault or shortcoming on the part of the staff of the Subordinate Court and for that matter, any delay in compliance by the Court were hardly the reasons for the High Court to immediately adopt the course of transferring the matter and that too, to a different station." The court therefore set aside the High Court order and restored the case on the file of Aligarh court.

Coming down heavily on an educational institution for denying admission to a child with special needs, the Madras High Court observed that the institution had not only failed in performing its duty but had also brought bad repute to the Christian Missionary in whose name the institution was running.  The sixth respondent is quite pathetically and ironically named after a third-generation American Medical Missionary in India. It makes me wonder whether those in administration today are riding on that name without following her principles or the core conduct which the noble lady adhered to.  The court was hearing a plea by a child calling upon the State and the Education Department to ensure her admission in respondent school in line with the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and the National Trust For Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999. The petitioner's mother had contended that the child was denied admission merely by stating that she did poorly in her examination and interview when the child was only mildly autistic and was normal in all other aspects.  Justice CV Karthikeyan noted that even though towards the end of the proceedings, the respondent school had remonstrated that it would appoint special educators and would also admit the child into their school, the same appeared to be a hollow submission.  Such an offer should have given voluntarily. It should be from the heart. It should be in spirit and not in mere expression of words alone. I hold that the statement about willingness to appoint teachers trained to teach children with special needs had been stated only to brush under the carpet the earlier stand of refusal to look after those children. It is just white washing. There was no real intent.  Referring to precedents from Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and the Madras High Court, the single judge noted that courts have always been sensitive to children with special needs and that educational institutions should rise to the occasion and motivate children to achieve their dreams.  It is thus seen that the Courts have always been sensitive to children with special needs. They have expressed hope that educational institutions would not betray children with special needs. They have called upon educational institutions to rise to the occasion and extend their arms to those children. Education signifies pulling up from the depth a child and motivate him or her to achieve his or her dream. The sixth respondent has failed not only in this duty but also betrayed the name of the noble Missionary and extremely, extremely distressingly their Christian faith.  The petitioners submitted that the school had taken an aggressive stand and refused admission to the child even though they belonged to the same community as that of the administrator of the respondent school. Even though the school’s website indicated that they offer education to children with special needs, they were now trying to evade responsibility.  During the course of the hearing, the court also directed the State to schools in the district which offer education for special children. Additional Government Pleader U Baranitharan informed the court that there were three such schools and that state would take every step to ensure that the child is given good education in any of the three schools. He further submitted that the intention of the State was to provide education to special children in an inclusive environment and not to exclude them from main stream education.  The court noted that it cannot thrust any child on any school and that it was for the child’s mother to decide assessing the best educational environment for the child.   The Court can only express it views. The Court cannot thrust any child on any school but can only open the hearts of those, who project to impart education, an education which is inclusive in nature. I would leave the options open.  Case Title: The Child rep. by her mother v. State of Tamil Nadu and others   
The Allahabad High Court recently held that the Defence of public good as an exception to the offence of Defamation as defined under Section 499 of Indian Penal Code being a question of fact can't be looked into during the stage of issuance of summons.

The Allahabad High Court recently held that the Defence of public good as an exception to the offence of Defamation as defined under Section 499 of Indian Penal Code being a question of fact can't be looked into during the stage of issuance of summons.  The Bench of Justice Dr Yogendra Kumar Srivastava observed thus:  "The benefit of the first exception (to section 499 IPC) cannot be claimed at the stage of issuance of summons"  The First exception to Section 499 IPC states thus:  "It is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it be for the public good that the imputation should be made or published. Whether or not it is for the public good is a question of fact"  Significantly, this exception recognizes the publication of truth as a sufficient justification, if it is made for the public good.   The matter before the Court  An application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. had been filed seeking to quash the proceedings of Complaint Case under Section 500 I.P.C., pending before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Varanasi.  The Counsel for the applicant also sought to assail the order dated January 18, 2020 in terms of which the applicant had been summoned.  It was contended that the offence under Section 499 I.P.C. was not made out inasmuch as the case was covered under the first exception to the section which provides that if the imputation is made for public good, the same would not amount to defamation.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court referred to the apex Court's ruling in the case of Chaman Lal Vs. State of Punjab (1970) 1 SCC 590 to observe that public good is a question of fact and the onus of proving the two ingredients under the first exception i.e. the imputation is true and the publication is for public good, is on the accused.  Further, regarding the stage of issuance of summons, the Court noted that at the stage of issuing process the Magistrate is mainly concerned with the allegations made in the complaint or the evidence led in support of the same and he is only to be prima facie satisfied whether there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused.   "At this stage, there is no requirement to enter into the detailed factual aspects or on the merits or demerits of the case," noted the Court.  In this backdrop, the Court ruled thus:  "The question whether or not the imputation was made for public good would therefore be a question of fact which would be required to be proved by the accused to seek the benefit of the first exception to Section 499. The defence in this regard being a question of fact, can be decided during trial only and the benefit of the first exception cannot be claimed at the stage of issuance of summons."

'Reservation is not at odds with merit but furthers the distributive impact of social justice', the Court said.The Supreme Court on Thursday pronounced the detailed order giving reasons for its January 7 direction to allow the commencement of counselling process for NEET-PG and NEET-UG for 2021-22 admissions on the basis of the existing 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections(EWS) in the All India Quota.The Court has passed a detailed judgment... The Supreme Court on Thursday pronounced the detailed order giving reasons for its January 7 direction to allow the commencement of counselling process for NEET-PG and NEET-UG for 2021-22 admissions on the basis of the existing 27% quota for Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections(EWS) in the All India Quota. The Court has passed a detailed judgment to uphold the constitutionality of 27% OBC quota and has passed another order giving reasons for not staying the existing EWS crtiria for the ongoing admissions. To approve 27% OBC reservation in All India Quota, a bench comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice AS Bopanna provided the following reasons :  (i) Articles 15(4) and 15 (5) are not an exception to Article 15 (1), which itself sets out the principle of substantive equality (including the recognition of existing inequalities). Thus, Articles 15 (4) and 15 (5) become a restatement of a particular facet of the rule of substantive equality that has been set out in Article 15 (1);    (ii) Merit cannot be reduced to narrow definitions of performance in an open competitive examination which only provides formal equality of opportunity. Competitive examinations assess basic current competency to allocate educational resources but are not reflective of excellence, capabilities and potential of an individual which are also shaped by lived experiences, subsequent training and individual character. Crucially, open competitive examinations do not reflect the social, economic and cultural advantage that accrues to certain classes and contributes to their success in such examinations;  (iii) High scores in an examination are not a proxy for merit. Merit should be socially contextualized and reconceptualized as an instrument that advances social goods like equality that we as a society value. In such a context, reservation is not at odds with merit but furthers its distributive consequences;  (iv) Articles 15 (4) and 15 (5) employ group identification as a method through which substantive equality can be achieved. This may lead to an incongruity where certain individual members of an identified group that is being given reservation may not be backward or individuals belonging to the non-identified group may share certain characteristics of backwardness with members of an identified group. The individual difference may be a result of privilege, fortune, or circumstances but it cannot be used to negate the role of reservation in remedying the structural disadvantage that certain groups suffer;   (v) The scheme of AIQ was devised to allot seats in State-run medical and dental institutions in which students from across the country could compete. The observations in Pradeep Jain(judgment) that the AIQ seats must be filled by merit, must be read limited to merit vis-à-vis residence eservation. This Court in Pradeep Jain (supra) did not hold that reservation in AIQ seats is impermissible;   (vi) The Union of India filed an application before this Court in Abhay Nath (judgment) placing the policy decision of the Government to provide reservation for the SC and ST categories in the AIQ seats since until then in view of the confusion on demarcation of seat matrix, there was no clarity on whether reservations could be provided in the AIQ seats. The Union Government was not required to seek the permission of this Court before providing reservation in AIQ seats. Therefore, providing reservation in the AIQ seats is a policy decision of the Government, which will be subject to the contours of judicial review similar to every reservation policy;  (vii) It was clarified in Dinesh Kumar (II) (judgment) that the total seats demarcated for AIQ shall be determined without excluding reservation as was earlier directed by Pradeep Jain (supra) and clarified in Dinesh Kumar (I). However, this Court in Buddhi Prakash Sharma (judgment) had erroneously construed the clarification in Dinesh Kumar (II) to mean that there should be no reservation in AIQ seats. Therefore, the order in Abhay Nath (supra) was only clarificatory in view of the observations in Buddhi Prakash Sharma (supra); and  (viii) Clause 11 of the information bulletin specifies that the reservation applicable to NEET-PG would be notified by the counselling authority before the beginning of the counselling process. Therefore, the candidates while applying for NEET-PG are not provided any information on the distribution of seat matrix. Such information is provided by the counselling authority only before the counselling session is to begin. It thus cannot be argued that the rules of the game were set when the registration for the examination closed. After the judgment was pronounced today morning, Senior Advocate P Wilson, who represented Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party which had opposed the petitions, told Justice Chandrachud "it is a landmark verdict for social justice". Relevant observations from the judgment on merit are given below "The crux of the above discussion is that the binary of merit and reservation has now become superfluous once this Court has recognized the principle of substantive equality as the mandate of Article 14 and as a facet of Articles 15 (1) and 16(1). An open competitive exam may ensure formal equality where everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. However, widespread inequalities in the availability of and access to educational facilities will result in the deprivation of certain classes of people who would be unable to effectively compete in such a system. Special provisions (like reservation) enable such disadvantaged classes to overcome the barriers they face in effectively competing with forward classes and thus ensuring substantive equality. The privileges that accrue to forward classes are not limited to having access to quality schooling and access to tutorials and coaching centres to prepare for a competitive examination but also includes their social networks and cultural capital (communication skills, accent, books or academic accomplishments) that they inherit from their family. The cultural capital ensures that a child is trained unconsciously by the familial environment to take up higher education or high posts commensurate with their family's standing. This works to the disadvantage of individuals who are first-generation learners and come from communities whose traditional occupations do not result in the transmission of necessary skills required to perform well in open examination. They have to put in surplus effort to ompete with their peers from the forward communities.  On the other hand, social networks (based on community linkages) become useful when individuals seek guidance and advise on how to prepare for examination and advance in their career even if their immediate family does not have the necessary exposure. Thus, a combination of family habitus, community linkages and inherited skills work to the advantage of individuals belonging to certain classes, which is then classified as ―merit reproducing and reaffirming social hierarchies". Idea of merit based on exam scores requires deeper scrutiny "This is not to say that performance in competitive examination or admission in higher educational institutions does not require a great degree of hard work and dedication but it is necessary to understand that ―merit‖ is not solely of one's own making. The rhetoric surrounding merit obscures the way in which family, schooling, fortune and a gift of talents that the society currently values aids in one's advancement. Thus, the exclusionary standard of merit serves to denigrate the dignity of those who face barriers in their advancement which are not of their own making. But the idea of merit based on ―scores in an exam requires a deeper scrutiny. While examinations are a necessary and convenient method of distributing educational opportunities, marks may not always be the best gauge of individual merit. Even then marks are often used as a proxy for merit. Individual calibre transcends performance in an examination. Standardized measures such as examination results are not the most accurate assessment of the qualitative difference between candidates".  Exams may reflect current competence of individual but not the gamut of their potential "At the best, an examination can only reflect the current competence of an individual but not the gamut of their potential, capabilities or excellence,which are also shaped by lived experiences, subsequent training and individual character. The meaning of ―merit itself cannot be reduced to marks even if it is a convenient way of distributing educational resources. When examinations claim to be more than systems of resource allocation, they produce a warped system of ascertaining the worth of individuals as students or professionals. Additionally, since success in examinations results in the ascription of high social status as a ―meritorious individual, they often perpetuate and reinforce the existing ascriptive identities of certain communities as ―intellectual and ―competent by rendering invisible the social, cultural and economic advantages that increase the probabilities of success. Thus, we need to reconceptualize the meaning of ―merit. For instance, if a high-scoring candidate does not use their talents to perform good actions, it would be difficult to call them ―meritorious merely because they scored high marks. The propriety of actions and dedication to public service should also be seen as markers of merit, which cannot be assessed in a competitive examination. Equally, fortitude and resilience required to uplift oneself from conditions of deprivation is reflective of individual calibre" The content of merit cannot be devoid of what we value in society.  "If merit is a social good that must be protected, we must first critically examine the content of merit. As noted above, scores in an exam are not the sole determinant of excellence or capability. Even if for the sake of argument, it is assumed that scores do reflect excellence, it is not the only value that is considered as a social good. We must look at the distributive consequences of merit.  An oppositional paradigm of merit and reservation serves to entrench inequalities by relegating reserved candidates to the sphere of incompetence, and diminishing their capabilities. We have already stated that while examinations are a necessary and convenient method to allocate educational resources, they are not effective markers of merit. The way we understand merit should not be limited to individual agency or ability (which in any event is not solely of our own doing) but it should be envisioned as a social good that advances equality because that is the value that our Constitution espouses. It is important to note that equality here does not merely have a redistributive dimension but also includes recognizing the worth and dignity of every individual. The content of merit cannot be devoid of what we value in society. Based on the above discussion, we find it difficult to accept the narrow definition of merit (that is, decontextualised individual achievement). We believe such a definition hinders the realisation of substantive equality" EWS criteria As regards criteria to determine EWS(Rupees 8 lakhs gross annual income cut-off), the Court allowed the existing criteria to operate for the current admission year so as to not delay the admission process further. However, future application of EWS criteria, which has been stipulated in the Office Memorandum of July 2019, will be subject to final outcome of the petitions.  Also Read :  OBC Quota In PG Courses Not Prohibited; Can't Say Backwardness Will Disappear With Graduation: Supreme Court In NEET-AIQ Case  Case Title : Neil Aurelio Nunes and others versus Union of India and others Citaiton :  (SC) 73      
The Delhi High Court has appointed retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri, as Administrator to oversee utilization of funds in the upcoming ISSF Shooting World Cup, 2023. ISSF World Cup (Rifle/Pistol) is scheduled to be held in Bhopal in March.  A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad observed that the country’s prestige will be affected if there is any impediment in organizing the World Cup event which would require funding from the Central Government.  The court said that the Administrator can also take assistance of any sportsperson of his choice, who has been a national or an international shooter, to assist him in the matter.  “The Administrator shall be free to fix his remuneration commensurate to the work and the same will be paid by the Union of India. The funds released must get the concurrence of the Administrator,” the court said.  The bench sought a report to be furnished in a sealed cover after conclusion of the event. The court was hearing an application moved by National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) seeking vacation or modification of the orders passed last year in a plea moved by Senior Advocate Rahul Mehra, against decisions taken by the Centre giving recognition to various National Sports Federations.  The plea sought direction on the Central Government to grant recognition to National Sports Federations only after they comply with National Sports Code, 2011.  On June 3 last year, a coordinate bench directed the Centre to ensure that monies, patronage and other facilities to National Sports Federations be resumed only when they comply with National Sports Code and various judicial orders. NRAI in its application sought vacation or modification of the order stating that it has affected the smooth functioning of the National Sports Federations as the entire working capital has come to a standstill. It was submitted that stoppage of funds would affect hosting of the World Cup and that the Association is dependent on the government for conduct of international events in the country, including training of the shooters and their participation in international events. However, Mehra objected to the application stating that the Association ought not to have come to the court at the last minute and that granting any latitude would result in further applications being filed by other Sport Federations which are in violation of the Sports Code.  However, he suggested an ad hoc solution that a committee comprising of a retired Judge and Abhinav Bindra, the first Olympic Gold Medal winner in Shooting, may be constituted to oversee the World Cup event. He also stated that the funds proposed to be released must be passed through the said Committee, which would then furnish its report in a sealed cover on conclusion of the event. Calling the suggestion “a fair solution”, the bench noted that Mehra’s proposal was not opposed by the ASG and NRAI. “In view of the above, Hon’ble Mr. Justice (Retd.) Arjan Kumar Sikri, Former Judge Supreme Court of India, is appointed as an Administrator to oversee the utilization of funds in the World Cup event that is being held in India in March, 2023,” the court said while disposing of the application.

"The specific purpose may be infertility treatment or some similar reason, but it should not be construed to be a fundamental right for having conjugal relationship as a course", the larger bench clarified in the reference made by the Division benchIn a pertinent judgment, Madras High Court has answered i) whether the denial of conjugal rights to a convicted prisoner would be violative of Article 21 and, ii) whether the state can be directed to consider the request made by convict for emergency leave or ordinary leave for the said purpose. Since the right of their spouses to have conjugal rights are also indirectly curtailed... In a pertinent judgment, Madras High Court has answered i) whether the denial of conjugal rights to a convicted prisoner would be violative of Article 21 and, ii) whether the state can be directed to consider the request made by convict for emergency leave or ordinary leave for the said purpose.  Since the right of their spouses to have conjugal rights are also indirectly curtailed by such denial, Madras High Court has examined the scope of treating conjugal rights of a convict/ prisoner as a fundamental right, and in case there is such a right, whether it would be unconditional or subject to other restrictions. The court answered the above questions while deciding upon the propriety of directing the state to grant emergency leave or ordinary leave to a convict for the purpose of having a conjugal relationship with the spouse. In a reference made by the Division Bench of High Court over the dilemma that there is no specific provision in Tamil Nadu Suspension of Sentence Rules, 1982, for availing leave to have conjugal relationship with the spouse, a three-judge bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, Justice PD Audikesavalu and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana answered in the affirmative that prisoners/ convicts can claim such a right if there is a ground of  'extraordinary reason' and infertility treatment falls within the definition of 'extraordinary reasons' as envisaged in the Act. The bench opined that the prayer of the petitioner to undergo infertility treatment when the convict and the spouse do not have a child in the wedlock forms 'extraordinary reason' under Rule  20 (vii) of 1982 Rules. However, the court made a clarification that if the couple had a child in the wedlock, then seeking leave for infertility treatment would not have been considered as an 'extraordinary reason'. The convict/ prisoner cannot seek leave over and over for the same ground in the category of 'extraordinary reason', the court added. "It is true that the 1982 Rules do not provide leave for having conjugal relationship with spouse. It is for the reason that if a provision for leave to have conjugal relationship is provided, the prisoner may ask for the leave invariably on that ground and, that too, time and again. It cannot, however, mean that under all circumstances except those specified in Rule 20(i) to (vi) and Rule 20(viii) of the 1982 Rules leave can be denied, rather Rule 20(vii) of the 1982 Rules provides for grant of leave for any other extraordinary reasons, which can be of the nature referred in this case, i.e., for undergoing infertility treatment..." About whether it can be held that the denial of conjugal rights offends Article 21 and whether the convict/ prisoner can seek to avail such a right continuously and without no restraint, the larger bench noted as below: "The denial of conjugal relationship of the convict for specific purpose may amount to denial of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The specific purpose may be infertility treatment or some similar reason, but it should not be construed to be a fundamental right for having conjugal relationship as a course. This would make a difference between the law abider and violator in regard to rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India." The three-judge bench was of the firm opinion that a leave for a 'specific purpose' like infertility treatment is different from the use of the term 'conjugal relationship' in common parlance and falls well within the realm of 'extraordinary reason'' provided for in the Rules. Therefore, the court concluded that the 1982 Rules itself protect the rights of the prisoner guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India to the extent it is required, without any specific provision for grant of leave to convicts for maintaining their conjugal relationship. On the basis of the above finding on the first question, the court went on to answer the second question. The court observed that the state can be directed to grant ordinary/ emergency leave for 'extraordinary reasons' like infertility treatment. Leave cannot be claimed as a right by the prisoner/ convict for having a conjugal relationship with his/ her/ their spouse without an 'exceptional reason'. The husband detenue who is a life convict and the petitioner wife did not have a child out of wedlock. Though the former was granted ordinary leave of two weeks by the Division Bench for availing infertility treatment, another writ petition was filed by the wife for a grant of six weeks leave for having a conjugal relationship through infertility treatment. Analysing the judgments of Punjab & Haryana High Court in Jasvir Singh v.  State of Punjab (2015), apex court in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, (1978) 4 SCC 494 & Bihar High Courtin Rajeeta Patel v. State of Bihar and others (2020), the court formed an opinion that Rule 20(vii) of the 1982 Rules can be invoked for the prisoner to avail ordinary/ emergency leave for having a conjugal relationship only if there are 'extraordinary reasons' for such request made. "If we hold that deprivation of conjugal right to a convict offends Article 21 of the Constitution of India, it would mean to give right to a convict for conjugal right, which in common parlance is for maintaining the marital relationship of husband and wife in continuity with companionship. The same cannot be permitted for a convict, as a difference has to be made between the law abider and violator. If the case in hand is also taken note of, the petitioner's first petition was allowed with grant of leave for two weeks for undergoing infertility treatment and immediately after availing it, the second petition was filed in continuity. The facts aforesaid cannot be ignored by the court because after the judgment by the court holding conjugal right to be a fundamental right, the convict would come out with an application to secure his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India without any restraint....", the court elaborated in the concluding part of the judgment about not holding the conjugal relationship of the convicts as a fundamental right they possess under Article 21 as a matter of course, though it can be availed as a fundamental right for 'specific purpose'. While answering the questions posed by the Division Bench, the three-judge bench also distinguished the judgment of the Madras High Court full bench in The State v. Yesu, (2011). In the said case, the question was pertaining to grant of parole via an administrative instruction under Article 162. The full bench held that neither the government nor any other stathority has power to grant parole in the absence of the rules or a statute. Analysing the Yesu judgment, the court opined that the findings in the said case does not apply squarely to the power of authorities to grant leave to the convict under the 1982 Rules by suspension of sentence for the leave period. After answering both the questions in the above manner, the registry was directed by the bench to place the matter before the roster bench for disposal. Case Title: Meharaj v.

The Bombay High Court has refused to allow a mentally challenged rape victim to terminate her 35-week (8.5 months) pregnancy after a board of medical experts opined it was a high risk to maternal health.

The Bombay High Court has refused to allow a mentally challenged rape victim to terminate her 35-week (8.5 months) pregnancy after a board of medical experts opined it was a high risk to maternal health.  A division bench of Justices Gangapurwala and AS Doctor said that the court would be guided by the report of the Expert Committee, but since the pregnancy was a result of rape, certain directions were necessary:  The investigator should remain present at the time of delivery so that DNA samples can be collected soon after the delivery and be used during the trial. If the child is born alive, the State should take care of the child in accordance with guideline under a 2019 landmark judgement on Medical Termination of Pregnancy.   The petitioner approached the court on July 26, 2022 under section 3(2)(b) of the MTP and the bench took up the matter for hearing the very next day.   Advocate Yogesh Birajdar, for the petitioner submitted that she was a rape victim and owing to her medical condition the family learned of the pregnancy at a much later stage. The offender is booked under section 376, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code at the Indapur Police Station, he said.   The court then directed the expert committee at Sasoon General Hospital, Pune to examine the victim and submit a report on August 29.   Once the victim was examined the committee submitted a report through AGP MP Thakur. After a psychiatric evaluation they opined that the woman has moderate intellectual disability.   According to her physical evaluation, termination of pregnancy at this advanced gestational age may be considered high risk to maternal health including need of operative interventions.   "The foetus is very much salvageable due to absence of gross foetal anomalies as per sonography…On clinical and sonographic examination of mother, due to advanced gestational age, medical termination of pregnancy is not recommended with kind permission of Hon'ble High Court," the committee opined.   "This Court would be guided by the report of the Expert Committee," Court said.   The court then added that the guardian of the petitioner shall intimate the Investigating Officer regarding the place of delivery and the officer shall remain present so that necessary steps can be undertaken for the purpose of DNA text, tissue culture and other tests required to facilitate the trial.  The bench said it would consider further aspects of the compensation after hearing the AGP on August 17, 2022.  The observations from the 2019 judgement that would apply to the present case are as follows-   (h) In an MTP case if the child is born alive, the registered medical practitioner and the hospital/clinic concerned will have to assume full responsibility to ensure that such child is offered best medical treatment available in the circumstances, in order that it develops into a healthy child;   (i) We further hold that where, this Court, in exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has permitted medical termination of pregnancy and the child is born alive, if the parents of such child are not willing to or are not in a position to assume the responsibility for such child, then, the State and its agencies will have to assume full responsibility for such child and offer such child medical support and facilities, as may be reasonably feasible, adhering always to the principle of best interests of such child as well as the Statutory provisions in the Juvenile Justice Act.

The Allahabad High Court recently denied bail to a Husband who has been accused of burning her 22-year-old wife and thereafter, burying her dead body was buried at a secret place in connection with the demand of dowry. The Bench of Justice Vikas Kunvar Srivastav denied bail to Bablu (husband of the deceased) as the court remarked that the alleged act of husband was evident of callous greed of a heartless husband and self-centered irresponsible father of the infant child. The case in brief  The deceased/victim was married to the accused applicant about three years ago from the date of the incident (December 2013) and just after the marriage was solemnized, the in-laws of the deceased, began to insist on additional dowry. Allegedly, they used to pressurise her to transfer a considerable amount of money from the deposits of her father and since the demand could not be fulfilled by reason of poverty and indigence of father, they severally used to beat the victim. Lastly, as per the FIR, when they were convinced about the poverty and incapacity of the father to give additional dowry, they all collusively killed her and secretly cremate her body. An FIR was lodged in the matter by the father of the deceased and the accused-applicant (Husband) was booked under Sections 498-A, 304-B, 201 I.P.C., and Section 3/4 D.P. Act. During the investigation, the dead body was exhumed from the place of burial and an inquest proceeding was done before the witnesses. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the accused-applicant had willingly caused the death of his wife after beating her brutally in connection with the demand of dowry soon before her death as prima facie it was established from the ante mortem injuries found on the dead body. The Court further noted that the dead body was burnt and buried at a secret place was also prima facie established, and, no information of death was given to the father and other family members of the deceased, which, the Court opined, reflected the criminal mens rea of the accused. Against these circumstances, the Court opined that these circumstances established that the death of the deceased was a result of planned and premeditated murder.  In the aforesaid circumstances, the Court, before denying bail to the husband, remarked thus: "...the brutality with wife a 22 years old lady and mother of an one year's infant child in causing her death, beating her cruelly by the present accused applicant 'her husband' is not only grave in nature but heinous also, and is evident of callous greed of a heartless husband and self centered irresponsible father of the infant child. All the witnesses have not been examined as offered by the prosecution in charge sheet and still a material number of witnesses remain to be examined. The cruel nature and instinct of the applicant in case of his release on bail certainly would adversely affect the witnesses." Lastly, opining that the prosecution had succeeded successfully in prima facie establishing its case against the accused-applicant, who is the main accused of the case, the Court denied him bail.

In a recent judgment, the Kerala High Court expressed concerns that the consumerist culture of 'use and throw' has affected matrimonial relationships. The Court lamented that the younger generation is seeing marraige as an "evil", which has to be avoided to "enjoy free life" and that live-in relationships are on the rise. Remarking upon the sanctity that the institution of marriage has been attributed with, the Division Bench composed of Justice A. Muhammed Mustaque and Justice Sophy Thomas, observed as follows "Kerala, known as God's own Country, was once famous for its well knit family bondage. But the present trend it seems to break the nuptial tie on flimsy or selfish reasons, or for extra-marital relationships, even unmindful of their children. The wails and screams coming out of disturbed and destroyed families are liable to shake the conscience of the society as a whole. When warring couples, deserted children and desperate divorcees occupy the majority of our population, no doubt it will adversely affect the tranquility of our social life, and our society will have a stunted growth". Particularly emphasizing upon the younger generations' views on marriage, the Court noted that,  "Now-a-days, the younger generation think that marriage is an evil that could be avoided to enjoy free life without any liabilities or obligations. They would expand the word 'WIFE' as 'Worry Invited For Ever' substituting the old concept of 'Wise Investment For Ever'. The consumer culture of 'use and throw' seems to have influenced our matrimonial relationships also. Live-in-relationships are on the rise, just to say good-bye when they fell apart". The judgment authored by Justice Sophy Thomas was delivered in a matrimonial appeal filed by a husband seeking divorce. According to the factual matrix of the case, the husband had filed an OP (Divorce) before the Family Court, at Alappuzha, on the ground of matrimonial cruelty. The couple who had married as per Christian rites, and had three daughters, were living in Saudi Arabia. It was submitted by the appellant/petitioner, represented by Advocates  Mathew Kuriakose, J. Krishnakumar, and Moni George, that his wife developed some behavioural abnormalities and picked up quarrels with him alleging that he had illicit relationship with other women. It was alleged by him that due to this abusive and violent behaviour of the respondent-wife, he became mentally stressed and physically ill, and hence, filed the petition for divorce.  The respondent however, represented by Advocates J. John Prakash, P. Pramel, Nimmi Shaji, and Balasubramaniam R., contended that the appellant was merely concocting reasons to keep himself away, and that she never displayed any cruelty, nor had she ever physically assaulted or threatened him, as per his allegations.  The Court at this juncture could not concede to the appellant's submissions that the behaviour of the wife amounted to matrimonial cruelty, and observed,  "When the wife had reasonable grounds to suspect the chastity or fidelity of her husband, and if she questions him, or expresses her deep pain and sorrow before him, it cannot be termed as a behavioural abnormality, as it is the natural human conduct of a normal wife. The normal human reactions or responses from a wife, on knowing that her husband was having illicit connection with another lady, cannot be termed as behavioural abnormality or cruelty from the part of the wife, so as to dissolve their marriage". It was relying upon the testimonies of the witnesses produced, including the mother of the appellant, that the court arrived at its observation.  It was added that the Courts of the land "could not come to the aid of an erring person to legalise his activities, which are per se illegal". Hence, it was observed that if the husband had indeed, developed an illicit relationship with another woman, he could not rely upon the Courts of the land to come to his aid by dissolving his legally solemnized marriage. Importantly, it was observed by the Court that in order to amount to 'cruelty' to amount to ground of divorce under Section 10 (1)(X) of the Divorce Act, the appellant would have to establish that since the solemnisation of the marriage, the respondent has treated him with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his mind that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with the respondent.  "Mere quarrels, ordinary wear and tear of matrimonial relationships or casual outburst of some emotional feelings cannot be treated as cruelties warranting a divorce", it was observed. It was in this light that the court observed that in the instant case, the factual situation clearly showed that the appellant had developed an 'unholy alliance' with another lady, which caused disturbances in their family life, and hence, no such matrimonial cruelty, as able to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the appellant that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with the respondent was proved by the appellant. In such circumstances, the Court did not find cause to interfere with the finding of the Family Court, Alappuzha that the appellant was not entitled to decree of divorce on the ground of matrimonial cruelty, and the appeal, was thus, dismissed.  Case Title: xxxx v. xxxx     
The Delhi High Court has upheld a circular stipulating that the city's district court employees can be allowed to visit a foreign country only during Summer Vacations, Winter Vacations, Public Holidays and in case of any exigency. A single judge bench comprising of Justice V Kameswar Rao dismissed a plea challenging the order dated January 31, 2022 passed by the respondent, Office of the Principal District and Sessions Judge, whereby it had rejected the application of the petitioner, who held the post of Senior Personal Assistant in the Court of an Additional Sessions Judge at Rohini Courts.  The said application sought grant of Earned Leave for a period of 30 days, by referring to the impugned circular dated August 4, 2018 which stipulated that a court staff can be allowed to visit a foreign country only during Summer Vacations, Winter Vacations, Public Holidays and in case of any exigency. The wife of the petitioner was in the employment of the Ministry of External Affairs, posted in the Embassy of India, at Harare, Zimbabwe where she was residing with their daughter, aged 17 years.  On September 13, 2021, the petitioner filed an application with the office of the respondent seeking grant of EL for a period of 30 days to visit his family in Zimbabwe, to provide assistance to his daughter for her admission to an educational institution. Vide order dated December 18, 2021, the application was rejected. The challenge in the petition was thus to the circular dated August 04, 2018 and the order dated January 31, 2022 issued by the office of the respondent on the ground that the same were unconstitutional and null and void. The Court noted that the request of the petitioner was rejected on three grounds; firstly, it did not show any satisfactory reason; secondly, there was a scarcity of staff and thirdly, he has already availed leaves of more than three years during the period 2017 to 2020 for travelling abroad. On the contention that the impugned circular discriminates between those District Court employees who wish to travel abroad and those who wish to travel within India, the Court said thus: "The plea is without merit, in view of the CCS (Leave) Rules on which reliance has been placed by the counsel for the petitioner himself, more specifically, Rule 7, which stipulates in no uncertain terms that leave cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The Rule, in fact contemplates when the exigencies of public service so require, leave of any kind may be refused or revoked by the authority competent to grant it. In other words, even a leave sought to travel within India can be denied/ revoked in the event of an exigency. Hence, there is no violation of Article 14 of Constitution of India, as alleged by the counsel." On another argument that there was no intelligible differentia and reasonable nexus between the impugned circular and the object sought to be achieved, the Court said that the same was also without merit.  "It is a conceded case that the petitioner is an employee of a District Court. The Courts, supported by the staff appointed, discharge an important public function of rendering justice to the people. It is to ensure that this important public function of rendering justice to litigants is unhindered, that the impugned circular is issued which contemplates that an employee working in a District Court can apply for permission to travel abroad only during summer vacations, winter vacations, public holidays and in case of any exigency." "Further, objective behind the circular is, as travelling abroad, is always for a larger duration, (in this case the petitioner sought leave for thirty days) such visits must be undertaken during the summer, winter and public holidays. The exceptions to summer, winter and public holidays is, if there is an exigency (subject to the satisfaction of the competent authority), the employee can travel abroad," the Court observed. It added that in any case, the underlying rule was that an employee cannot seek permission to go abroad by availing leaves, as a matter of right.  "Clearly, there is an objective sought to be achieved by the impugned circular. Hence, this plea is rejected," it said.  The Court said that the impugned circular had applicability to all the employees of all District Courts in Delhi. It also rejected the argument of the petitioner that there was no foundation in any of the Rules of 2012 and CCS (Leave) Rules, which permitted the respondent to impose any restriction on its employees to travel abroad.  "I must state that the impugned circular does not restrict an employee having an exigency, seeking permission to travel abroad when it is not summer vacations, winter vacations or public holidays. The request of the petitioner for sanction of thirty days EL between March 21, 2022 to April 19, 2022 was denied vide the impugned order, as the request of the petitioner did not reflect satisfactory reasons inasmuch as he has sought the leave on the ground of helping his wife in admitting their daughter to a new school and meeting his family members. Furthermore, the establishment/court was undergoing a scarcity of staff and the petitioner had already availed leaves for more than three years during the period 2017-2020 for travelling abroad," the Court said.  Finding no merits in the plea, the Court dismissed the same.  Case Title: RAJESH KAPOOR v. OFFICE OF THE LD. PRINCIPAL DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE    
Dismissing an application for pre arrest bail in an FIR for offences under the NDPS Act the Himachal Pradesh High High Court on Friday observed that the drug menace is a serious invasion in the social structure that needs to be curbed with heavy hands and for such purpose, police must have the proper access to the accused which may be by way of custodial interrogation in appropriate cases.  The observations to this effect were made by a bench comprising Justice Satyen Vaidya while adjudicating upon the matter in which the police party apprehended a car near place Barmana in District Bilaspur, H.P., which was being plied without any registration number and 15.13 grams of chitta/heroin was recovered from the vehicle.    During investigation, it was found by the Investigating Agency that the occupants of the car had procured the recovered contraband from the petitioner after paying him Rs. 40,000/-. Accordingly, petitioner was also named as a co-accused.  In his pre arrest bail the petitioner submitted that he was innocent and was not connected with the crime in question. He further submitted that he is a law abiding person and has roots in society and his implication in the present case was totally false.   After perusing the available record Justice Vaidya noted that the investigating agency has been able to lay hands on some material, which primafacie establishes a link between the occupants of the car apprehended with chita/ heroin and the petitioner. The CDRs and other data, indicate exchange of calls and location of petitioner and other co-accused at or around the same place, at the time when alleged offence was committed, the court pointed.   Observing that since the investigation is still going on, Justice Vaidya highlighted that the drug menace has attained serious proportion and all the accused persons apprehended in the car are in the age group of 23 to 27 years. Besides being a law and order problem, it has become a serious social issue and such a serious invasion in the social structure needs to be curbed with heavy hands and for such purpose, police needs to have the proper access to the accused, may be by way of custodial interrogation in appropriate cases, Justice Vaidya emphasized.   Pointing out to the fact that the material on record to suggest some link between the petitioner and other co-accused, the court observed that the Petitioner is aged about 44 years and there is age gap between him and other co-accused and the link needs to be probed. The recoveries are yet to be effected from petitioner and in such view of the matter, it cannot be said that the custodial interrogation of petitioner would be unjustified in this case, the bench underscored.  In light of above discussion, there is no merit in the petition and the same is rejected, the bench concluded.      Case Title: Anil Kumar Vs State of HP  Coram: Justice Satyen Vaidya   
The Calcutta High Court has recently held that the testimony of a sole eyewitness with respect to an accused cannot be ignored solely because her evidence with respect to the other co-accused persons has been found to be unreliable.

The Calcutta High Court has recently held that the testimony of a sole eyewitness with respect to an accused cannot be ignored solely because her evidence with respect to the other co-accused persons has been found to be unreliable.  A Bench comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Bibhas Ranjan De observed that the principal of 'falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus' (false in one thing, false in everything) is not applicable in India with respect to appreciation of evidence. Accordingly, the Bench upheld the sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon the appellant for the offence of murder under Section 302 IPC on the basis of the testimony of the sole eye witness (PW 5).  "In India, the principal 'falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus' does not apply in the matter of appreciation of evidence. When the Court is called upon to assess the evidence of a witness, it becomes its bounden duty to assess the evidence of the witness on the anvil of probability and separate the kernel of truth from the chaff of embellishment. The trial court has rightly assessed the evidence of PW 5 and upon ignoring her embellished effort to implicate other associates of the appellant in the crime, correctly relied on the role of the appellant as the sole assailant of the deceased." It was further held that although the sole eye witness (PW 5) may have been 'over enthusiastic' in implicating the other co-accused persons, however, her testimony with regards to the role of the appellant in the murder of the deceased has been corroborated by other sources.  "Effort of PW 5 to implicate other accused persons appears to be over enthusiastic and was rightly mixed by the trial Judge due to lack of corroboration. However, her version vis-à-vis role of the appellant in the murder resonates with truth and finds corroboration from other sources. It would be wrong to ignore her evidence qua the appellant while discarding her embellished version with regard to other accused persons. Hence, the acquittal of the other accused persons does not affect the truthfulness of the prosecution case, vis-à-vis the appellant", the Court underscored.  Background  In the instant case, the appellant had been convicted under Section 341 (wrongful restraint) and Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. He had been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life along with a fine of Rs.5,000 and in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 30 days more for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. Whereas, a sentence of simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable under Section 341 IPC had been further imposed.  On January 19, 2021, an altercation broke out between the appellant and one Manik Hembram over drawing water for irrigation through a pump. Subsequently, on January 21, 2021 the appellant had again threatened Hembram. Thereafter, in the evening around 5:45 pm while the deceased, Gangaram Hembram, father of Hembram was going on a bicycle the appellant had dragged him down from his bicycle and then proceeded to bear him mercilessly with a hassle along with others. The deceased had expired on the spot.  Subsequently, an FIR was lodged by the son of the deceased and thereafter the appellant had been arrested and the weapon of assault had also been recovered.  Observations  The Court noted that the prosecution case principally rests on the evidence of the sole eye witness, PW 5. It was further noted that the appellant had challenged the testimony of PW 5 by contending that her testimony in Court is at variance with her earlier statement before the Magistrate.  Pursuant to the perusal of the record, the Court observed that PW 5 in her deposition has explained the circumstances in which she witnessed the incident. Accordingly, the Court recorded in its order,  "She stated she had seen the deceased passing Kasundipara club in a bicycle. At that time the appellant and others accosted the deceased and appellant had assaulted the deceased with the help of hasuli. She also claimed other persons had also assaulted. In her statement before Magistrate, the witness stated that the appellant had dragged the deceased down and thereafter he and others had assaulted him to death." However, the Court ruled that her evidence with regards to the role of the other accused persons has not been corroborated by the son of the deceased in his FIR. In this regard, the Court underscored further, "I find sufficient corroboration with regard to the role played by the appellant in assaulting the deceased with a hasuli but not with regard to the role of other accused persons in the assault." The Court further stated that the Trial Court has correctly relied upon the testimony of PW 5 in convicting the appellant as the role of the appellant in the assault of the deceased not only transpires at the earliest opportunity in the FIR  but is also supported by the medical evidence on record.  Accordingly, the Court dismissed the appeal by observing,  "In the light of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the opinion that it was the appellant who dealt the fatal blow on the deceased with a hasuli resulting in his death. The manner in which he had attacked the victim and the injury caused on the vital organ of the body, leaves no doubt in my mind that he intended to murder him. Thus, I am inclined to confirm the conviction and sentence of the appellant." Case Title: Lakshi Ram Hembram @ Laxmiram Hembram v. State of West Bengal

The Kerala High Court recently ruled that no permission was required to advertise ayurvedic treatment and facilities of an institution, as long as they were not advertising any drug. However, the Bench clarified that this order should not be treated as a blanket order to publish advertisements about treatment. Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan also directed the State to issue a circular to certain authorised officers to monitor such advertisements and to take appropriate steps for any violation of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules or  Act. "If any complaint from any part arises, I make it clear that this court will take it very seriously."  The Court also made a significant observation in the matter whereby it was suggested that a legislation be drafted for advertising treatment of certain diseases to prevent unqualified persons from offering any treatment. If the State did not possess the legislative competency for the same, it was directed to address this issue with the Centre. Factual Background: A recent amendment to the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules, 1945 imposed certain restrictions for advertising drugs. Pursuant to this amendment, the petitioner, a registered medical practitioner, applied for the issuance of a unique ID number so he can publish an advertisement.  However, he alleged that this application was not considered since the software for the same was not programmed. Aggrieved by the same, he approached the Deputy Drugs Controller to advertise his hospital and the facilities therein.  Nevertheless, this was rejected on the ground that the Controller was not authorised to grant permission for the same. Challenging this, the petitioner approached the Court.  Contentions:  The petitioner's case was that Rule 170 only prohibits the advertisement of Ayurvedic drugs and that there was absolutely no bar on advertising treatment. Such a bar was not imposed even in the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act. The Government Pleader responded that the petition itself was not maintainable since it was instituted without approaching the authorities for advertisement by submitting a proper application. Findings of the Court: The Court agreed with the petitioner that Rule 170 did not prohibit advertising treatment given by an individual or other facilities of treatment in a hospital.  "The petitioner has no case that he wants to advertise any drugs manufactured by him or any drug used for his treatment. In such circumstances, according to me, Rules 170 of Rule 1945 is not at all applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case." Similarly, Section 3 of the Act also only prohibited the advertising of certain drugs for the treatment of certain diseases and disorders. Upon perusing the advertisement intended to be published by the petitioner, the Bench also noted that it was not related to any drug for the use of diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any diseases, disorder, syndrome or condition.  Therefore, the single Judge decided that there was no law prohibiting the petitioner from publishing his advertisement.  "If any casualty or after effect is caused because of such treatment, the petitioner alone is responsible and if any criminal/civil liability arose because of any treatment undertaken by the petitioner, he alone is responsible," it added. Regarding the State's argument attacking the maintainability of the plea, the Court held that when there is no provision in the Act and Rules to get permission from the authorities for such advertisement for treatment, the petitioner was entitled to publish his advertisement. Advocates B.S Swathi Kumar, Anitha Ravindran, Harisankar N. Unni and P.S Bhagya Surabhi appeared for the petitioner while the respondents were represented by Senior Government Pleader Deepa Narayanan. Case Title: Dr. Sidharadhan K v. State of Kerala & Anr.

The Supreme Court held that a person who is ineligible under Section 29A of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code to submit a resolution plan, cannot propose a scheme of compromise and arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013. The bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah also upheld the constitutional validity of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016, which stipulate that a person who is not eligible under the IBC to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor shall not be a party in any manner to such compromise or arrangement. The Court observed thus while dismissing the appeals against National Company Law Appellate Tribunal and also a writ petition challenging constitutional validity of Regulation 2B Of Liquidation Process Regulations. NCLT, in these cases, held that a person who is ineligible under Section 29A of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code to submit a resolution plan, is also barred from proposing a scheme of compromise and arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013. "It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation or participating in the sale of the corporate debtor as a 'going concern', are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013.", the Apex Court bench observed. Referring to various precedents and provisions of both IBC and Companies Act 2013, the court observed thus in para 68 of the judgment: The statutory scheme underlying the IBC and the legislative history of its linkage with Section 230 of the Act of 2013, in the context of a company which is in liquidation, has important consequences for the outcome of the controversy in the present case. The first point is that a liquidation under Chapter III of the IBC follows upon the entire gamut of proceedings contemplated under that statute. The second point to be noted is that one of the modes of revival in the course of the liquidation process is envisaged in the enabling provisions of Section 230 of the Act of 2013, to which recourse can be taken by the liquidator appointed under Section 34 of the IBC. The third point is that the statutorily contemplated activities of the liquidator do not cease while inviting a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230. The appointment of the liquidator in an IBC liquidation is provided in Section 34 and their duties are specified in Section 35. In taking recourse to the provisions of Section 230 of the Act of 2013, the liquidator appointed under the IBC is , above all, to attempt a revival of the corporate debtor so as to save it from the prospect of a corporate death. The consequence of the approval of the scheme of revival or compromise, and its sanction thereafter by the Tribunal under Sub-section (6), is that the scheme attains a binding character upon stakeholders including the liquidator who has been appointed under the IBC. In this backdrop, it is difficult to accept the submission of Mr Bajaj that Section 230 of the Act of 2013 is a standalone provision which has no connect with the provisions of the IBC. Undoubtedly, Section 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit in the sense that it is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC. Obviously, therefore, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings under Section 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC. But, when, as in the present case, the process of invoking the provisions of Section 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin or, as it may be described, the trigger to the liquidation proceedings which have been initiated under the IBC, it becomes necessary to read both sets of provisions in harmony. A harmonious construction between the two statutes would ensure that while on the one hand a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 is being pursued, this takes place in a manner which is consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC because the scheme is proposed in respect of an entity which is undergoing liquidation under Chapter III of the IBC. As such, the company has to be protected from its management and a corporate death. It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation or participating in the sale of the corporate debtor as a 'going concern', are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013.  The court, also rejected the contention that attaching the ineligibilities under Section 29A and Section 35(1)(f) of the IBC to a scheme of compromise and arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013 would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as the appellant would be "deemed ineligible" to submit a proposal under Section 230 of the Act of 2013. "We find no merit in this contention. As explained above, the stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages. Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum. Thus, the prohibitions that apply in the former situations must naturally also attach to the latter to ensure that like situations are treated equally.", the court said. The court also rejected the contention that Section 35(1)(f) applies only to a liquidator who conducts a sale of the property of the corporate debtor in liquidation but not to the NLCT, acting as the Tribunal, when it exercises its powers under Section 230 of the Companies Act 2013. It observed thus: "The liquidator appointed under the provisions of Chapter III of the IBC is entrusted with several powers and duties. Sections 37 to 42 of the IBC are illustrative of the powers of the liquidator in the course of the liquidation. The liquidator exercises several functions which are of a quasi-judicial in nature and character. Section 35(1) itself enunciates that the powers and duties which are entrusted to the liquidator are "subject to the directions of the adjudicating authority". The liquidator, in other words, exercises functions which have been made amenable to the jurisdiction of the NCLT, acting as the Adjudicating Authority. To hold therefore that the ineligibility prescribed under the provisions of Section 35(1)(f) can be disregarded by the Tribunal for the purpose of considering an application for a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013, in respect of a company which is under liquidation under the IBC, would not be a correct construction of the provisions of law." The main ground of challenge to Regulation 2B was that the regulation transgressed the authority of IBBI by introducing a disqualification or ineligibility in regard to the presentation of an application for a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act. Addressing this argument, the court observed thus: "The position in our view can be considered from two perspectives, independent of the provisions of Regulation 2B. We have indicated in the discussion earlier that even in the absence of the Regulation 2B, a person ineligible under Section 29A read with Section 35(1)(f) is not permitted to propose a scheme for revival under Section 230, in the case of a company which is undergoing a liquidation under the IBC. We have come to the conclusion, as noted for the reasons indicated earlier, that in the case of a company which is undergoing liquidation pursuant to the provisions of Chapter III of the IBC, a scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed under Section 230 is a facet of the liquidation process. The object of the scheme of compromise or arrangement is to revive the company. The principle was enunciated in the decision in Meghal Homes (supra) while construing the provisions of erstwhile Section 391. The same rationale which permeates the resolution process under Chapter II (by virtue of the provisions of Section 29A) permeates the liquidation process under Chapter III (by virtue of the provisions of Section 35(1)(f)). That being the position, there can be no manner of doubt that the proviso to Regulation 2B is clarificatory in nature. Even absent the proviso, a person who is ineligible under Section 29A would not be permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013. We therefore do not find any merit in the challenge to the validity of Regulation 2B."  Dismissing the appeals, the bench concluded thus: Based on the above analysis, we find that the prohibition placed by the Parliament in Section 29A and Section 35(1)(f) of the IBC must also attach itself to a scheme of compromise or arrangement under Section 230 of the Act of 2013, when the company is undergoing liquidation under the auspices of the IBC. As such, Regulation 2B of the Liquidation Process Regulations, specifically the proviso to Regulation 2B(1), is also constitutionally valid.       Read Judgment

The approach of the Union of India in the manner it has filed the present special leave petition exasperates us, the Supreme Court remarked while dismissing Special Leave Petitions filed by the Central Government with a delay of 6616 days. All earlier counsel appears to have been thrown in the dustbin, said the bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said. In this case, the Centre had filed an appeal before the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court against a single bench judgment delivered on 07.05.2002.  This appeal was dismissed for non-prosecution on 15.12.2008. In the year 2016, the Centre filed an application seeking restoration of the LPA seeking condonation of delay of 2590 days. This application was dismissed by the Division Bench observing that Central Government cannot be compared to an illiterate litigant.  "We have heard learned Additional Solicitor General for some time and must note that the only error which seems to have occurred in the impugned order is of noticing that it is not an illiterate litigant because the manner in which the Government is prosecuting its appeal reflects nothing better! The mighty Government of India is manned with large legal department having numerous officers and Advocates. The excuse given for the delay is, to say the least, preposterous.", the Apex Court bench observed taking note of the delay to file SLP ( 532 days and 6616 days from the original order). "We have repeatedly being counselling through our orders various Government departments, State Governments and other public authorities that they must learn to file appeals in time and set their house in order so far as the legal department is concerned, more so as technology assists them. This appears to be falling on deaf ears despite costs having been imposed in number of matters with the direction to recover it from the officers responsible for the delay as we are of the view that these officers must be made accountable. It has not had any salutary effect and that the present matter should have been brought up, really takes the cake!", the Court further said referring to earlier orders passed by it in the matter of belated filing of SLPs by Government and public authorities. The bench then imposed special costs of Rs.1 lakh. "A copy of this order be placed before the Law Secretary, Govt. of India and Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource Development to look into the matter personally not only making them accountable for compliance but also to ensure that we are not faced with such matters in future.", the court said.

Panigrahi refused the permission sought... Quoting political philosopher William Godwin, the Orissa High Court, while stressing that Justice is the sum of all moral duty, directed the State Government to pay ₹10 Lakh as compensation to a 20-year-old gang-rape victim who became pregnant due to the offence committed against her. However, the Bench of Justice S.K. Panigrahi refused the permission sought by the victim to terminate her over 26-week pregnancy noting that the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 do not permit the termination of pregnancy of the petitioner. Facts of the case Essentially, the Court was dealing with the plea of a gang-rape victim who is carrying over 26-week pregnancy, who was denied permission to abort her child by the court of S.D.J.M., Banki, on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. Challengng the order, she moved to the High Court. It was submitted by her counsel that being an unmarried young girl, she has not just suffered physically and mentally but has also been deprived of maintaining a dignified social life due to the commission of the said offence. It was also argued that the petitioner has been pregnant for more than 4 months and feels morally insecure to step out of her house due to the horrendous social stigma attached to such a crime. In pursuance of the order of the Court, the medical team of S.C.B. Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack submitted that it may be unsafe for getting the termination done at this stage (over 26-week pregnancy).  In fact, the report stated that allowing the termination at this stage could endanger the mother's life or even lead to a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function [NOTE: As per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, which came into force with effect from 24th September 2021, the upper limit for medical termination of pregnancy has been raised to 24 weeks, from the earlier stipulation of 20 weeks, for certain categories of women which will be defined in the MTP Rules. These categories will include 'vulnerable women' including rape victims. As per the Amendment, the opinion of one doctor will be required for termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks; and the opinion of two doctors will be required for termination of pregnancy of 20 to 24 weeks.]  Court's observations The Court, at the outset, observed that crime like rape affects the lives of victims and associated physical and emotional consequences. "Rape is a crime not only against a woman but against humanity at large as it brings out the most brutal, depraved and hideous aspects of human nature. It leaves a scar on the psyche of the victim and an adverse impact on society," the Court remarked Further, taking into account the scheme of the MTP Act, the Court noted that in the instant case there is no medical opinion that termination of pregnancy is immediately necessary to save the life of the petitioner as per Section 5 of the MTP Act.  "Viewed from every angle, the provisions of the MTP Act do not permit the termination of pregnancy of the petitioner," the Court observed. "There is no opinion of any registered medical practitioner that the continuance of pregnancy of the petitioner would involve a risk to her life or grave injury to her physical or mental health. Further, there is no suggestion that if the child were born, it would suffer from any physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped." the Court added indicating that she can't be permitted to terminate her pregnancy. Further, observing that she is being forced to bear and care for the unwanted child is bound to severely impact her personality and womanhood, the Court opined that her request should have been acceded to over and above the right to life of the child yet to be born. Against this backdrop, the Court did add that such an issue is still crying for an unperplexed solution by way of suitable amendment in the statute governing the field. Additionally, stressing that the ordeal of mental agony and fear of social ostracism can take a toll on the victim and even on the unborn child, the Court ruled that in the instant case, there is no other legal option for her but to undergo suffering and deliver the baby since the pregnancy is over twenty-six weeks old. Lastly, ordering 10 lakh compensation, the Court also directed the District Collector, Cuttack to ensure that arrangements are made to provide proper diet, medical supervision and medicines as may be necessary, to the victim throughout the remaining part of her journey of pregnancy. When the time for delivery arrives, proper medical facilities be made available for safe delivery of the child, the Court issued the direction. Case title - 'X' v. State of Odisha & Ors  Read order  
The Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal on Friday frowned at the State Government's resistance to add the option of "other gender" to the application form for enrolment of transgenders in the state police department.  Even as the Maharashtra Government cited administrative difficulties and the need for a policy from the Central Government first, MAT Chairperson Justice Mridula Bhatkar was of the opinion that the State was "fully empowered to draw its own policy and take decisions in such matters."  The chairperson noted steps taken by the Governments of Bihar, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for the inclusion of transgenders in their respective police force and other government departments.  The tribunal was seized with an application by 23-yr-old Arya Pujari seeking an opportunity to apply for the post of constable in the "other gender" category of the police force. In August, Chairperson Bhatkar had granted the Home Department six months to take a policy decision on the issue.   On November 14, the MAT directed at least one post to be reserved for transgender persons in the selection process of constables this year. Subsequently, it directed the State to add the option of "other gender" in all online application forms and fix the criteria for physical standards and tests for transgender candidates.  Pujari's advocate informed the tribunal on Friday that the State was yet to implement any of the orders.   State's lawyer Swati Manchekar submitted that the home department intended to challenge the order owing to administrative difficulties. She also claimed that the SC's order in the ongoing Shanavi Ponnuswamy's case and the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) required the Centre to take a policy decision first.   "…till today neither the order of this Tribunal has been complied with nor it is challenged before the Hon'ble High Court. Thus, the order of the Tribunal is frustrated," Justice Bhatkar noted at the outset.   She recorded the petitioner's submissions who pointed out an officer memorandum from the Central Government way back in 2020 directing all Government Ministries to modify recruitment rules for inclusion of transgenders to be in conformity with the provisions of The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.   Justice Bhatkar acknowledged the State's right to appeal but also reproduced sections of the NALSA judgement in which directions were given independently to the Central Government as well as the State Government.   Regarding Shanavi Ponnuswamy's case, the tribunal observed that the Civil Aviation Ministry was the respondent in that case, therefore directions were issued accordingly. Moreover, 'Police' is a subject in the State List of the Constitution of India, and thus, the State Government is fully empowered to draw its own policy and take decisions in such matters.   It was pointed out that Bihar had modified its recruitment rules to include transgenders. In 2021 Karnataka modified its rules to not only allow transgenders to participate in the process of recruitment in the Police Department, but they were also provided reservation in all the services of the State of Karnataka. The Tamil Nadu Government in its recent advertisements created separate physical tests for transgender men and transgender women.  Accordingly, Chairperson Bhatkar extended the date of acceptance of transgenders application form to December 8 and adjourned the matter to December 23, 2022.      
The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a batch of petitions filed by various private tour operators seeking exemption from the Goods and Services Tax for the Haj and Umrah services offered by them to pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia. A bench of Justices A. M. Khanwilkar, A. S. Oka and C. T. Ravikumar pronounced the judgment. Justice Oka, who read out the operative protion of the judgment, said "we have dismissed the petitions on both the grounds of exemption and discrimination". Justice Oka said that the argument raised by the petitioners regarding extra territorial application of GST for services given outside India is kept open, as it is pending consideration before another bench.  The tour operators are challenging the levy of GST on Hajis who avail themselves of services offered by registered private tour operators on the grounds that no tax law can be applicable on extra territorial activities per Article 245 of the Constitution. It is their argument that the services consumed outside India cannot be sujbected to GST. They also argued that the levy is discriminatory as it exempts certain hajis who undertake the pilgrimage through the Haj Committee of India. A GST levy of 5% (with input tax credit) is applicable on air travel by pilgrims who utilise the services of non-scheduled/charter operations for religious pilgrimage facilitated by the Centre under bilateral arrangements. However, if the services of a specified organisation in respect of a religious pilgrimage is facilitated by the External Affairs Ministry under bilateral arrangement, the rate would be nil. The other limb of the argument is that the services offered to Hajis such as flight journey, accommodation etc, are eligible for the exemption granted to religious activities.

The Calcutta High Court on Monday quashed a Single Bench order wherein a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe had been ordered into the alleged irregularities in the appointment of 'Group-D' (non-teaching staff) in sponsored Secondary and Higher Secondary schools under the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) on the purported recommendation by the West Bengal... The Calcutta High Court on Monday quashed a Single Bench order wherein a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe had been ordered into the alleged irregularities in the appointment of 'Group-D' (non-teaching staff) in sponsored Secondary and Higher Secondary schools under the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) on the purported recommendation by the West Bengal Central School Service Commission (WBSSC). Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay had directed the CBI to submit a preliminary report in this regard by December 21.  On November 23, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the West Bengal Central School Service Commission had jointly moved a Division Bench comprising Justices Harish Tandon and Rabindranath Samanta against the impugned order. Consequently, the Division Bench had stayed the impugned order for for 3 weeks.  On Monday, the Division Bench set aside the impugned order and further set up an inquiry committee headed by Justice Ranjit Kumar Bagh, former judge of the Calcutta High Court. The other members of the committee include Asutosh Ghosh, Member of West Bengal School Service Commission, Paromita Roy, Deputy Secretary (Administration), West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and advocate Arunava Banerjee, a practicing lawyer of the High Court.  The Court further directed the inquiry panel to submit a report in this regard within 2 months.  In a strongly worded order, Justice Gangopadhyay had observed that 'corruption writ large in the whole process of this public employment which is required to be dealt with in a firm hand'. He had further underscored,  "Which is that invisible hand who prepared and sent the recommendation letters to the Board's office and which are the invisible hands who issued the recommendation letters as have been annexed under the signature of the Chair Person of the Regional School Service Commissions as has been disclosed by the Board?" Emphasising on the need to conduct a probe by an impartial agency, Justice Gangopadhyay had further remarked, "This is a matter of Education Department which is a State department and in such matters to instill confidence in the public as to the fairness in the appointment in posts for which money from the public exchequer would be spent there should be one enquiry by an impartial agency. I observe that the miscreants, there must be some persons behind this whole corrupt affair, whatever be their position in the society or in the polity, cannot be really political persons - they can take shelter under different political parties. So CBI should look into the extreme irregularity in this appointment from that angle also" Background  In 2016, the State government had recommended the appointment of about 13,000 non-teaching staff in different government aided schools and accordingly the WBSSC had conducted examinations and interviews periodically and thereafter a panel had been constituted. The term of the panel had ended in 2019. However, subsequently, there were widespread allegations that the Commission had made several irregular recruitments close to almost 500 even after the expiry of the panel.  The Court on November 17 had also taken on record a report filed by the Commission wherein the Commission had admitted that the panel and the waiting list for the posts of 'Group-C' and 'Group-D' had expired on 4th May, 2019. A notification published by the West Bengal Central School Service Commission on September 2, 2019 had also made a similar assertion. However, in spite of the expiry of the panel, 25 appointment letters had been issued by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education containing reference of recommendations issued by different regions like Western Region, Northern Region, Southern Region and Eastern Region. In this regard, Justice Gangopadhyay had also sought the personal attendance of Secretary of the West Bengal Central Service Commission. Furthermore, the Court on November 23 had also taken on record the affidavit filed by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, the contents of which the Court had labelled as 'really surprising'. The Board had apprised the Court that it is in possession of original recommendations issued by the Commission with District Inspector of Schools memo mentioned upon its recommendations and the entire data had been received by them in hard copies. Justice Gangopadhyay had noted that this shows that recommendations came from the Commission, be it West Bengal Central School Service Commission or West Bengal Regional School Service Commission, and accordingly the Board issued the appointment letters. Case Title: West Bengal Board Of Secondary Education and Anr v. Sandeep Prasad and Ors    
The Calcutta High Court bench of Justice T.S. Shivagnanam and Justice Hirnmay Bhattacharyya has held that the GST department cannot detain vehicles in the absence of a second e-way bill as the first e-way bill was valid in the interception period.  The respondent/assessee submitted that the detention of the vehicle along with the goods and the demand for tax and penalty were not justified. The e-way bill,  which was being carried in the vehicle transporting the goods, expired at midnight on September 8, 2019 and the goods were transported on September 9, 2019. The vehicle was intercepted at 1.30 p.m. (noon).   The assessee contended that the vehicle transporting goods had broken down and, on account of that, there was delay and there was no willful intention to evade payment of tax.   The department filed an appeal before the Single Judge Bench. The single Bench disposed of the writ petition by setting aside the order dated September 11, 2019. It was held that the assessee was entitled to get a refund of penalty and tax paid on protest, subject to compliance with all legal formalities. The department was aggrieved by such an order and appealed before the division bench.  The department contended that neither before the appellate authority nor in the pleadings in the writ petition, the assessee had stated anything about the vehicle being broken down or that the non-extension of the validity of the e-way bill was not deliberate and willful but due to the circumstances as stated. When such was the factual position, the single bench ought not to have allowed the writ petition by accepting the argument, which was placed for the first time when the writ petition was moved before the Court.  The assessee contended that the writ petitioner had raised a tax invoice in favour of Om Dayal Educational and Research Society, which had its registered office at Kolkata but the goods had to be delivered as per the instruction of the purchaser at Delhi Public School, Sector–2D, Bidhannagar, Durgapur. The assessee had raised a second e-way bill as the the distance between the places was 9 kilometres, the e-way bill was valid upto September 8, 2019. The vehicle number in both the e-way bills will clearly show that it is the same vehicle.  The court held that the bona fides of the writ petitioner had to be tested on the documents, which were available on record.  "The first e-way bill dated September 7th, 2019 was valid up to September 9th, 2019. Therefore, in the absence of the second e-way bill, the tax authorities at Durgapur could not have intercepted or detained the vehicle. Therefore, the explanation offered by the respondent/writ petitioner was an acceptable explanation and a case cannot be made out that there was a deliberate and willful attempt on the part of the respondent/writ petitioner to evade payment of tax so as to justify invocation of the power under Section 129 of the Act," the court while granting the relief to the assessee observed.

While upholding the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes carried out by the Central Government in 2016, the Supreme Court observed that the question whether the measure has achieved its objects is not relevant while deciding its legality. A Constitution Bench comprising 5 judges upheld the demonetisation exercise as valid by a 4:1 majority, with Justice BV Nagarathna dissenting from other four judges - Justices S Abdul Nazeer, BR Gavai, AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian- to hold otherwise. "It is not relevant whether the objectives sought have been achieved or not. What is required is that there has to be an objective which is for proper purposes and there has to be reasonable nexus with the measure and the objectives", Justice BR Gavai said while reading out the majority judgment. Justice Nagarathna, in her dissenting judgment, observed :"It has also been brought on record that around 98% of the value of the demonetised currency notes have been exchanged for bank notes which continues to be a legal tender. Also a new series of bank notes for Rs 2000 was released by the bank. This would suggest the measure itself was may not have been proved to be as effective as it was hoped to be. However, this court does not base its decision on the legality of a legislation qua the effectiveness in achieving the stated objectives. Therefore, it is clarified that any relief moulded in the present case is divorced from the consideration of the success of such measures". The majority judgment held that there was no flaw in the decision making process relating to the November 8, 2016 decision. Also the decision satisfied the four-pronged tests of proportionality. "We find that the three purposes (curbing blackmoney, terror-funding and counterfeit currencies) are proper purposes. We have held that there was a reasonable nexus with the purposes. In so far as the third test concerning alternate measures, we have held that there cannot be alternative measures for the actions which are sought to be done by demonetisation. Fourth one is that whether there was proper relation between the importance of these purposes and the limitations on the constitutional rights. Applying these four tests, we have held that the action cannot be hit by the doctrine of proportionality". The majority answered the reference as follows : 1. The power available to the Central Govt under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act cannot be restricted to mean that it can be exercised only for one or some series of bank notes and not for all series of bank notes. The power can be exercised for all series of bank notes. Merely because on earlier two occasions, the demonetisation exercise was done through plenary legislations, it cannot be held that such a power is not available be to Central Govt under Section 26(2) of RBI Act . 2. Section 26(2) of the RBI Act does not provide for excessive delegation inasmuch as there is an inbuilt safeguard that such a power has to be exercised through a recommendation by the central board. As such, Section 26(2) is not liable to be struck down on the said ground. 3. Impugned notification dated 8 nov 2016 does not suffer from any flaws in the decision making process. 4. The impugned notification dated 8 nov 2016 satisfies the test of proportionality and cannot be struck down on the said ground 5. The period provided for the exchange of notes cannot be said to be unreasonable 6. The RBI does not possess independent power under Section 4(2) of the 2017 Act, in isolation of the provisions of Section 3 and 4(1) thereof to accept the demonetised notes beyond the period of notification issued under Section 4(1) of the 2017 Act.  Justice Nagarathna, while holding that the decision was unlawful, held that the declaration will only operate prospectively and will not affect any actions already taken. Since the notification has been acted upon, the status quo ante cannot be restored and hence, Justice Nagarathna said that no relief can be granted in the petitions.  
The Supreme Court held that an arbitral tribunal constituted as per an arbitration clause before the 2015 amendment to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 will lose its mandate if it violates the neutrality clause under Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule, which were incorporated through the 2015 amendment.The Court held that an arbitration clause that prescribes appointment... The Supreme Court held that an arbitral tribunal constituted as per an arbitration clause before the 2015 amendment to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 will lose its mandate if it violates the neutrality clause under Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule, which were incorporated through the 2015 amendment. The Court held that an arbitration clause that prescribes appointment of arbitrators contrary to the amended provision of Section 12(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act cannot be given effect. "...when the arbitration clause is found to be foul with the amended provision, the appointment of the arbitrator would be beyond the pale of the arbitration agreement, empowering the Court to appoint such an arbitrator as may be permissible.That would be the effect of the non-obstante clause contained in sub-section (5) of Section 12 and the other party cannot insist upon the appointment of the arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement", the Supreme Court observed in the case Ellora Paper Mills Limited v. State of Madhya Pradesh.  The Court said that an arbitrary tribunal appointed as per such an arbitration clause will lose its mandate with the coming into force of Section 12(5). "...by operation of law and by amending Section 12 and bringing on statute sub-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule, the earlier Arbitral Tribunal....has lost its mandate and such an Arbitral Tribunal cannot be permitted to continue and therefore a fresh arbitrator has to be appointed as per Arbitration Act, 1996".  A bench comprising Justices M.R. Shah and B.V. Nagarathna allowed an appeal filed by Ellora Paper Mills Limited, assailing the order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, which rejected its application filed under Section 14 read with Sections 11 and 15 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ("Act") to appoint a new arbitrator, stating that Amendment Act, 2015 shall be made effective from 23.10.2015 and cannot have retrospective operation in the arbitration proceedings already commenced unless the parties otherwise agree.  Factual Background  The State of Madhya Pradesh issued a tender for supply of cream wove paper and duplicating paper for the year 1993-94. Ellora Paper Mills Limited ("Ellora") participated in the tender process and was eventually awarded the contract on 22.09.1993. Subsequently, a dispute arose when the State of Madhya Pradesh did not make 90% of the payments for the paper supplied by Ellora as per the terms of the contract and rejected some consignments without providing any justifications. By a letter dated 15.11.1993, the State of Madhya Pradesh informed Ellora that the paper so supplied did not conform to the specifications. In 1994, Ellora filed a civil suit for permanent injunction against the State in Civil Court, Bhopal restraining it from awarding the contract to a third party. However, the suit became infructuous as the State had already awarded the supply order to a third party. Thereafter, Ellora filed another suit to recover Rs. 95,32,103. The State preferred an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ("Act") and sought stay of proceedings before the Civil Court, which was rejected. On revision the Madhya Pradesh High Court allowed the application and referred the parties to arbitration by the Stationery Purchase Committee comprising officers of the State of Madhya Pradesh [Additional Secretary, Department of Revenue as President and (i) Deputy Secretary, Department of Revenue, (ii) Deputy Secretary, General Administration Department, (iii) Deputy Secretary, Department of Finance, (iv) Deputy Secretary/Under Secretary, General Administration Department and (v) Senior Deputy Controller of Head Office, Printing as Members]. Against the order of the High Court a Special Leave Petition was preferred, but was eventually withdrawn.  As the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, Ellora filed an objection to its constitution and challenged its jurisdiction by filing an application under Section 13 of the Act, which was rejected. Thereafter, the High Court dismissed its Writ Petition. Ellora filed an application under Section 14 read with Section 11 and 15 of the Act before the High Court seeking termination of the mandate of originally constituted Tribunal and for appointment of a new arbitrator. The High Court rejected the said application.  Contentions raised by the Appellant  Advocate, Mr. Sandeep Bajaj appearing on behalf of Ellora argued that the impugned order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court was in derogation to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited v. Ajay Sales & Suppliers, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 730. It was contended that the continuation of a Tribunal consisting of officers of the State would frustrate the object of the Amendment Act, 2015, by which sub-section (5) to Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule was inserted to keep in check the impartiality and neutrality of the arbitrators. Section 12(5) reads as under -  "(5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator: Provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-section by an express agreement in writing." It was further averred that in Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited (supra), the Apex Court did not accept the submission that once a party participates in the arbitration proceeding, it would not be permitted to invoke Section 12(5) and seek appointment of a fresh Arbitral Tribunal. It was emphasised that without an express waiver, an application invoking Section 12(5) would be maintainable. It was submitted that the Tribunal was constituted in 2001, but it did not commence and a stay on the proceedings was in force till 2017. Moreover, some officers of the Tribunal had retired in the course of 20 years, yet no step was taken to constitute a fresh Tribunal.  Contentions raised by the Respondent  Advocate, Mr. Nachiketa Joshi appearing on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted in the year 2000, and Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule was inserted into the statute with effect from 23.10.2015. Therefore, it would not be applicable in the present fact scenario, as had been held in the impugned order.  Analysis by the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court observed that the Arbitral Tribunal - Stationery Purchase Committee was constituted as per the agreement entered into between the parties. It further noted that though the Tribunal was constituted in 2001, it could not commence due to the proceedings initiated by Ellora. In the meanwhile, the officers of the originally constituted Tribunal had also retired. The Court was of the view that given the circumstances, technically the arbitration proceedings had not commenced. The Court observed that in Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited (supra), the Apex Court had negatived the submission of the petitioner that the agreement was entered into prior to the 2015 Amendment to the Act and in view of the same the High Court was not justified in appointing a new arbitrator, moreso, when the arbitration proceedings had already been initiated. The Court noted -  "Section 12 has been amended by Amendment Act, 2015 based on the recommendations of the Law Commission, which specifically dealt with the issue of "neutrality of arbitrators". To achieve the main purpose for amending the provision, namely, to provide for "neutrality of arbitrators", sub-section (5) of Section 12 lays down that notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel or the subject matter of the dispute falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. In such an eventuality, i.e., when the arbitration clause is found to be foul with the amended provision, the appointment of the arbitrator would be beyond the pale of the arbitration agreement, empowering the Court to appoint such an arbitrator as may be permissible. That would be the effect of the non obstante clause contained in sub-section (5) of Section 12 and the other party cannot insist upon the appointment of the arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement." Citing Bharat Broadband Network Limited v. United Telecoms Limited (2019) 5 SCC 755, the Court observed that in the said judgment, it had negated the submission that if a contractor participated in arbitration proceedings, they cannot seek fresh appointment of arbitrator under Section 12(5). The Court held that the impugned order was contrary to the judgments of the Apex Court in TRF Limited v. Energo Engineering Projects Limited, (2017) 8 SCC 377, Bharat Broadband (supra) and Jaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh Limited (supra). It further held that the Tribunal, comprising officers of the State of Madhya Pradesh had lost its mandate in view of Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule of the Act. Considering that the dispute was pending since 2000, instead of remanding the matter back to the High Court, the Supreme Court decided to appoint Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre, a former Judge of the Supreme Court as the new arbitrator.

The Supreme Court set aside the Kerala High Court order which granting bail to a man accused murder of a lady doctor. The bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and Krishna Murari observed that seriousness of the charge is one of the relevant considerations while considering bail applications. According to the prosecution case, the accused, Mahesh on 28th September 2020 at about 3.30 p.m., stabbed a doctor who was about 30 years of age, with a knife, inside a multispecialty dental clinic, run by her. She was stabbed with a knife on the right side of the stomach, in the presence of her father, at the dental clinic. Though the Session's Court dismissed the bail application, the High Court allowed it observing that indefinite incarceration was not necessary. The bench, in appeal filed by the State, observed that the power to grant bail under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C is discretionary, such discretion has to be exercised judiciously. Seriousness of the charge is undoubtedly one of the relevant considerations while considering bail applications, the court added. "In this case, the impugned order of the High Court is flawed, in that the High Court noted the seriousness of the offence alleged, observed that the incident was heinous, but proceeded to grant bail to the Respondent Accused on the purported ground that he had been in custody since 6th October 2020 (that is, about 75 days) without even considering the materials on record which  prima facie made out reasonable grounds to believe that the Respondent Accused had committed the heinous offence. At that stage, even the chargesheet had not been filed. The High Court did not apply its mind to the severity of the punishment in the event of conviction, or the fact that the accused had been absconding after the incident.", the bench observed. The bench also noted that the High Court did neither consider nor discuss the elaborate reasons given by the Sessions Court in its order rejecting the prayer of the  Accused for bail.  "The impugned order of the High Court does not advert to any error in the reasoning of the Sessions Court. Nor is there any discussion of the reason why the High Court took a view different from that taken by the Sessions Court – whether there were any supervening circumstances within 10/12 days of the order of the Sessions Court, which necessitated a different view.", it added.  "The High Court, in our opinion, clearly erred in not appreciating that the apprehension of the Prosecution that the Respondent Accused would influence witnesses, could not be put to rest, by directing the Respondent Accused not to enter the jurisdiction of Ollur Police Station. The High Court completely ignored the fact that the deceased victim used to reside at Ernakulam. Her parents and her five years old daughter reside at Ernakulam. In other words, the only eye witness is a resident of Ernakulam. Most of the Prosecution witnesses were from Thrissur. There was no reason to suppose that the witnesses would restrict their movements to the limits of the jurisdiction of Ollur Police Station.", the court added. The court also observed that the High Court completely misappreciated the object, scope and ambit of the directions issued in Re : Contagion of Covid 19 Virus In Prisons. "The orders of this Court are not to be construed as any direction, or even observation, requiring release of under-trial prisoners charged with murder, and that too, even 23 before investigation is completed and the chargesheet is filed. The Respondent Accused, it is reiterated, is charged with murder in the presence of an eye witness, and the impugned order granting bail was filed even before the chargesheet was filed. The Chargesheet appears to have been filed on 01.01.2021. Moreover the Respondent Accused had been absconding after the incident.", it said.     
The Karnataka High Court has directed the state government to ask the Life Convicts Release Committee, headed by the Principal Secretary, State Home Department, to meet once in two months to review and pass orders on applications made for premature release/remission made by convicts serving life imprisonment. “I deem it appropriate to direct the State Government to henceforth direct the 2nd respondent/Committee to meet at least 6 times a year – once in two months, so that those application/s are considered at the right time on their individual merit and cases being filed only to place the application/s before the committee would be obviated,” said the court.  A single judge bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna passed the direction while allowing a petition filed by convict Omkarmurthy who has been in prison for over 16 years. The jail authorities have issued certificates favouring the petitioner observing that his conduct has been exemplary throughout. On all the aforesaid basis, the petitioner is seeking his premature release/remission. However, his plea was not placed before the Committee by the Chief Superintendent of police.  The counsel for petitioner informed the court that the Committee is required to meet once in two months, six times in a year but the Committee has not met for the last six months and therefore, the application of the petitioner has not been able to be placed before the Committee to consider his premature release.  However, the government advocate contended that the Committee has slated to meet in the month of March for consideration of the cases of the petitioner and the like on their merit. It would be the endeavour of the Government to meet frequently.  Findings The bench referred to the judgments of the Apex court in the case of Sondhar Vs State of Chhattisgarh and Karuna Shankar Vs State of Uttar Pradesh. “What would unmistakably emerge is that, the Committee though would not meet 8 times a year, but should at least meet 6 times a year, which would mean once in two months, as the life convicts are statutorily entitled for consideration of their premature release in terms of the guidelines notified by the State,” said the court  Noting that the cases of life convicts who are entitled for consideration of their premature release, should be considered without any loss of time the bench said:  “The Committee has not met for the last 8 months which has resulted in a plethora of cases being filed before this Court seeking a mandamus only to place those applications before the committee in the ensuing meeting. When the meeting would ensue the State itself is not aware, as no concrete date is being divulged for the committee to meet.” The court said till such time that the application of the petitioner would merit consideration before the committee, he would be entitled to be released on parole, "in accordance with law, for a period that the Authorities of the jail would prescribe or till such time, the committee would meet and consider the case of the petitioner.” Case Title: Omkarmurthy And State of Karnataka & Others  Case No: WRIT PETITION NO. 1300 OF 2023  Date of Order: 02-03-2023 Appearance: Advocate K.B Monesh Kuamr for Advocate Pradeep Patil for petitioner.

The Supreme Court observed that abhorrent nature of crime alone cannot be the decisive factor for awarding death sentence. Due consideration should also be given to the equally relevant aspect pertaining to mitigating factors before arriving at a conclusion that option of any other punishment than the capital one was foreclosed, the court said while commuting the death sentence awarded to a man accused of rape and murder of a seven year old girl. The bench comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar noted that the accused has no criminal antecedents, comes from a very poor socio-economic background, has a family comprising of wife, children and aged father, and has unblemished jail conduct.  "When all these factors are added together and it is also visualised that there is nothing on record to rule out the probability of reformation and rehabilitation, in our view, it would be unsafe to treat this case as falling in 'rarest of rare' category.", the court said. Pappu was sentenced to death after the Trial Court found him guilty of enticing a seven-year-old girl to accompany him on the pretext of picking lychee fruits; having thereafter committed rape upon the child; having caused her death; and having dumped the dead body near a bridge on the riverbank, after having dragged the dead body over a distance of one and one-quarter kilometres. The Allahabad High Court dismissed his appeal and confirmed the death sentence. In appeal, the bench took note of the evidence on record and concluded that the accused have been rightly found guilty under Sections 376, 302, 201 IPC and Section 5/6 POCSO Act. "In an overall view of the matter, it is proved beyond doubt in this case that the hapless child, seven-year-old daughter of the complainant, met with her gruesome end after having been treated inhumanely and having been subjected to sexual assaults; that the victim was lastly seen in the company of the appellant when he enticed and took her along to pluck and eat lychee fruits while shooing away the other children playing with her; that the dead body of the victim child was recovered at the instance of the appellant; and that the appellant failed to satisfactorily explain his whereabouts and his knowledge of the location of dead body. The medical and other scientific evidence has been consistent with the prosecution case and then, the defence version of enmity due to land dispute turns out to be false. That being the position, we have no hesitation in holding that the present case of circumstantial evidence answers the panchsheel principles of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra). The appellant was rightly convicted by the Trial Court and his conviction has rightly been maintained by the High Court. This part of the submissions on behalf of the appellant stand rejected.", the court said. The court thereafter considered the issue whether death sentence be maintained or substituted by any other sentence. In its judgment, the bench has summarised the evolution of legal position and norms for dealing with the question of sentencing in such matters and the connotations of 'special reasons' for awarding death sentence. The court observed thus: "It could readily be seen that while this Court has found it justified to have capital punishment on the statute to serve as deterrent as also in due response to the society's call for appropriate punishment in appropriate cases but at the same time, the principles of penology have evolved to balance the other obligations of the society, i.e., of preserving the human life, be it of accused, unless termination thereof is inevitable and is to serve the other societal causes and collective conscience of society. This has led to the evolution of 'rarest of rare test' and then, its appropriate operation with reference to 'crime test' and 'criminal test'. The delicate balance expected of the judicial process has also led to another mid-way approach, in curtailing the rights of remission or premature release while awarding imprisonment for life, particularly when dealing with crimes of heinous nature like the present one" The court noted that both the Trial Court as also the High Court have taken the abhorrent nature of crime alone to be the decisive factor for awarding death sentence in the present case. In this regard, the court observed: "The approach of the Trial Court had been that the accused-appellant was about 33-34 years of age at the time of occurrence and was supposed to be sensible. The Trial Court would observe that 'if such heinous crime is committed by him, it is not justifiable to show any sort of mercy in the punishment.' The High Court though has made rather intense comments on the menace of rape and brutal murder of children as also on the society's abhorrence of such crime12 but has, thereafter, proceeded to confirm the death sentence with a cursory observation that there were no substantial mitigating factors and the aggravating circumstances were aplenty. . ..In other words, the impugned orders awarding and confirming death sentence could only be said to be of assumptive conclusions, where it has been assumed that death sentence has to be awarded because of the ghastly crime and its abhorrent nature. The tests and the norms laid down in the relevant decisions commencing from those in Bachan Singh (supra) seem not to have acquired the requisite attention of the Trial Court and the High Court. It would have been immensely useful and pertinent if the High Court, while taking up the question of confirmation of death sentence and making several comments in regard to the abhorrent nature of crime and its repulsive impact on society, would have also given due consideration to the equally relevant aspect pertaining to mitigating factors before arriving at a conclusion that option of any other punishment than the capital one was foreclosed. The approach of the Trial Court and the High Court in this matter while awarding sentence could only be disapproved; and we do so in no uncertain terms." The bench therefore commuted the death sentence into that of imprisonment for life, with the stipulation that the accused shall not be entitled to premature release or remission before undergoing actual imprisonment for a period of 30 (thirty) years.        
The Gujarat High Court has affirmed the decision of the Sessions Court rejecting the complaint under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on the ground that the Petitioner had not approached the court with 'clean hands' and was accused of theft of electricity.

The Gujarat High Court has affirmed the decision of the Sessions Court rejecting the complaint under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on the ground that the Petitioner had not approached the court with 'clean hands' and was accused of theft of electricity.  Justice Samir Dave opined:  "It is settled law that the revisional powers of the High Court can only be exercised to prevent the abuse of the process of law and to secure the ends of justice. The process of law can be invoked by a principled and really aggrieved person who approaches the court with clean hands." It added, "The process of law cannot be allowed to be abused by a person who is facing trial for theft of Electricity and who himself avers such facts in his application under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C., as indicate that he is guilty of committing theft of Electricity; by making baseless allegations against the officials of a PGVCL without any supporting material or evidence. Apparently, the revisionist has filed that complaint in order to put a counter pressure on the officials for taking undue advantage in plural cases of theft of electricity lodged against the complainant."  The instant revision application was filed under Section 397 read with 401 of CrPC praying for the stay of the impugned order by the Sessions Judge.  The Petitioner was a Sarpanch of the relevant Gram Panchayat and alleged that officers from the Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited had visited her house and while checking her electricity meter, hurled casteist abuses at her.  The trial court rejected her complaint after perusing the report of the Deputy Commissioner of Police (SC-ST cell), statement of the complainant and other witnesses.  The Petitioner insisted that trial Court has not properly appreciated the statements and that it was her duty to file the complaints as a Sarpanch.  Per contra, the APP averred that as per affidavit of the petitioner herself, no incident was happened in presence of the witnesses and that the complaint was filed by the Petitioner as a 'counterblast' to the FIR lodged against her for theft of electricity.  Justice Dave concluded that the supplementary electricity bill was worth Rs. 54,000 and that the Petitioner's house had committed theft of electricity. There was also no evidence of the alleged incident involving abuse against the Petitioner. Accordingly, no prima facie case was made out against the PGVCL officers.  Citing the limited revisional powers of the High Court which can be exercised only where there is an abuse of process of law to secure the ends of justice, Justice Dave deemed it not to interfere with the impugned order. "There is total contradiction in the complaint filed by the petitioner and the representation made before the concerned authority," court said.

The Supreme Court doubted the earlier judgments which interpreted Section 3(2)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,1989, to mean that the offence should have been committed "only on the ground that the victim was a member of the Scheduled Caste. The bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed that this provision... The Supreme Court doubted the earlier judgments which interpreted Section 3(2)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,1989, to mean that the offence should have been committed "only on the ground that the victim was a member of the Scheduled Caste.  The bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah observed that this provision will attract as long as caste identity is one of the grounds for the occurrence of the offence.  To deny the protection of Section 3 (2) (v) on the premise that the crime was not committed against an SC & ST person solely on the ground of their caste identity is to deny how social inequalities function in a cumulative fashion, the court said.  The bench however did not refer the issue to larger bench since it found that the evidence in the present case does not establish that the offence in the present case was committed on the ground that such person is a member of a SC or ST.   The bench was considering the appeal filed by one Patan Jamal Vali, the sole accused tried for the offences punishable under Section 376(1) of the IPC and under Section 3(2)(v) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for committing rape on the victim girl who is aged about 20 years and blind by birth, on 31.03.2011 at about 9:30 AM in her house. The High Court had affirmed the conviction of the accused by the Trial Court on these charges. The Supreme Court finally set aside the conviction of the accused under Section 3(2)(v) of the SC and ST Act but upheld the conviction and life sentence punishable under Section 376 IPC. Juxtaposition of "the" before "ground" does not invariably mean that the offence ought to have been committed only on that ground.  The court noted that under Section 3(2)(v), an enhanced punishment of imprisonment for life with fine is provided where (i) The offence is committed by a person who is not a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe; (ii) The offence arises under the Penal Code and is against a person or property and is punishable with imprisonment for a term of ten years or more; and (iii) The offence is committed "on the ground that such person is a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe" or such property belongs to such a person. The court noted the decisions in Dinesh Alias Buddha v. State of Rajasthan (2006) 3 SCC 771, Ramdas and Others v. State of Maharashtra (2007) 2 SCC 170, in which it was observed that merely because a woman belongs to the SC & ST community, the provisions of the SC & ST Act would not be attracted in a case of sexual assault. In Ashrafi v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2018) 1 SCC 742 and Khuman Singh v. State of MP, the Court noted, Section 3(2)(v) was interpreted to mean that the offence should have been committed "only on the ground that the victim was a member of the Scheduled Caste." "The correctness of this exposition is debatable. The statutory provision does not utilize the expression "only on the ground". Reading the expression "only" would be to add a restriction which is not found in the statute. The statute undoubtedly uses the words "on the ground' but the juxtaposition of "the" before "ground" does not invariably mean that the offence ought to have been committed only on that ground. To read the provision in that manner will dilute a statutory provision which is meant to safeguard the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes against acts of violence which pose a threat to their dignity. As we have emphasized before in the judgment, an intersectional lens enables us to view oppression as a sum of disadvantage resulting from multiple marginalized identities. To deny the protection of Section 3 (2) (v) on the premise that the crime was not committed against an SC & ST person solely on the ground of their caste identity is to deny how social inequalities function in a cumulative fashion. It is to render the experiences of the most marginalized invisible. It is to grant impunity to perpetrators who on account of their privileged social status feel entitled to commit atrocities against socially and economically vulnerable communities. This is not to say that there is no requirement to establish a causal link between the harm suffered and the ground, but it is to recognize that how a person was treated or impacted was a result of interaction of multiple grounds or identities. A true reading of Section 3(2)(v) would entail that conviction under this provision can be sustained as long as caste identity is one of the grounds for the occurrence of the offence. In the view which we ultimately take, a reference of these decisions to a larger bench in this case is unnecessary. We keep that open and the debate alive for a later date and case.", the bench observed. 2016 Amendment decreased the threshold of proving that a crime was committed on the basis of the caste identity The court further noted that Section 3(2)(v) was amended by the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015, which came into effect on 26 January 2016. The words "on the ground of" under Section 3(2) (v) have been substituted with "knowing that such person is a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe". "This has decreased the threshold of proving that a crime was committed on the basis of the caste identity to a threshold where mere knowledge is sufficient to sustain a conviction. Section 8 which deals with presumptions as to offences was also amended to include clause (c) to provide that if the accused was acquainted with the victim or his family, the court shall presume that the accused was aware of the caste or tribal identity of the victim unless proved otherwise", the court said. The court observed that since these amendments came into force from 26 January 2016 they would not be applicable to the case at hand.

While commuting the death sentence awarded to a man to life imprisonment, the Madhya Pradesh High Court referred to the jurisprudence laid down in Bachan Singh to observe that the accused was denied an effective hearing.  A Division Bench of Justices G.S. Ahluwalia and  Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava noted that no sufficient opportunity was given to the accused-appellant for placing mitigating circumstances on record. It was further observed that the trial court did not consider the grant of any alternative punishment or the possibility of reformation. He remarked,  "For effective hearing under Section 235(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the suggestion that the court intends to impose death penalty should specifically be made to the accused, to enable the accused to make an effective representation against the death sentence, by placing mitigating circumstances before the Court." Background  The accused was found guilty for the offences under Section 363, 377, 302, and 201 of the Indian Penal Code, along with Section 3 and 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). A death sentence penalty was inflicted on the accused of the charges as mentioned earlier by the Additional Sessions Judge & Special Judge (POCSO Act, 2012) on the same day. Advocates Vivek Jain and S.S. Kushwah, appearing for the petitioner argued that there is no direct evidence in the case, instead the case is based on circumstantial evidence, and the chain of circumstances is incomplete. It was also argued that: (a) there are various material contradictions and omissions in the statements of prosecution witnesses; (b) no witness has proved last seen evidence; (c) DNA samples were not collected properly for forensic test and sent after delay; (e) pubic hairs of the accused were collected by cutting them with the help of a razor; therefore, the prosecution cannot rely upon the DNA report of accused/appellant. Challenging the order of conviction, the accused-appellant argued that it was passed erroneously, contrary to law, and against the evidence available on record. Relying on Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980), the accused-appellant argued that the present case does not fall in the 'rares of rare' criteria, and thus a death sentence cannot be awarded. State Counsel Rajesh Shukla and Rajiv Upadhyay argued that (a) the witnesses relating to last seen evidence have expressly stated the prosecution case, and despite being relatives of the deceased, there is no dent over the prosecution story; (b) the spot map prepared reflects the modus operandi of the accused and also reflects the intention of commission of the offence; (c) DNA testing has been done by following all precautions; (d) a doctor has proved the DNA profiling and has given specific finding regarding involvement of accused based on DNA testing. They also argued that the judgment of conviction and sentence is in accordance with the law. Findings The Court noted that the present case lacks direct evidence; thus, reliance had to be placed on circumstantial evidence. In such a situation, where there is no eye witness, and the Court relies on circumstantial evidence, more caution has to b exercised while analyzing the evidence. Therefore, the accused's guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and the chain of circumstantial evidence should be so connected that it only establishes the accused's guilt. The guilt hold must be conclusive in nature and tendency. The Court remarked, "When the case fully resists upon the circumstantial evidence, then it is the settled principle of law that all the circumstances available against the accused should be so connecting that only inference can be drawn that it is the appellant/accused who is the author of the crime concerned." On the question of the accused's guilt, the Court relied on several judicial precedents and studied the relevant provisions of IPC and POCSO Act to hold that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused has been rightly convicted.  The Court heavily relied on the Bachan Singh jurisprudence to decide whether the present case falls under the 'rarest of rare' doctrine. Noting that on the same day after hearing the counsel for the parties, the accused-appellant was sentenced with death punishment, among other punishments, the Court relied on Mohd. Mannan v. State of Bihar (2019), where it was held, "Imposition of the death sentence on the same day after pronouncement of the judgment and order of conviction may not, in itself, vitiate the sentence, provided the convict is given a meaningful and effective hearing on the question of sentence under Section 235(2) CrPC with the opportunity to bring on record mitigating factors."  The Court noted that no sufficient opportunity was given to the accused-appellant for placing relevant mitigating circumstances supported with an affidavit on record. Considering the young age appellant-accused, the Court also noted that the sentencing order does not consider alternative punishment or the possibility of reformation. It remarked, "The trial court did not attempt to elicit relevant facts, nor did the trial court give any opportunity to the petitioner to file an affidavit placing on record mitigating factors." The Court further relied on Mulla & Anr v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2010), where it was held that it is open to the Court to prescribe the length of incarceration, especially in cases where the death sentence has been replaced by life imprisonment. Noting the life possibility of a reprieve and/or remission of sentence after imprisonment for not less than 14 years, the Court chose against granting it. It sentenced the appellant-accused to imprisonment for life, till his natural death given the heinous, revolting, abhorrent, and despicable nature of the crime. Title: In Reference (Suo Moto) vs. Yogesh Nath @ Jogesh Nath  Read The Order    
The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court on Wednesday ruled that the power to compulsorily retire a government servant in terms of service rules is absolute, provided the authority concerned forms a bona fide opinion that compulsory retirement is in public interest. Such an order cannot be passed merely on the recommendation of the committee devoid of departmental inquiry and sufficient material to form bona fide opinion by the competent authority, it added.  The observations were made by the Division Bench comprising Justices Tashi Rabstan and Sindhu Sharma while hearing a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) preferred by the UT against the order of a Single Bench whereby impugned order regarding compulsory retirement of KAS Officer Bhumesh Sharma was quashed.  After hearing the counsel appearing for the parties, considering their rival contentions and perusal of record, the DB observed that it is well settled that when an order is challenged as arbitrary or mala fide in the petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, it is the Government's duty to provide documents for inspection of court.  "Not only the employer is obliged to produce the materials, but the onus of establishing that the order was made in public interest is also on the employer. The Supreme Court has clearly held that it is a terminal step to justify which the onus is on the administration, nor a matter where the victim must make out the contrary", the bench observed .  Elaborating on the law on the subject, the bench observed that the power to retire compulsory a Government servant in terms of service rules is absolute, provided the authority concerned forms a bona fide opinion that compulsory retirement is in public interest, further adding,   "although the scope of judicial review is limited, it has repeatedly been held by the Apex Court that when an order of premature retirement is challenged, the authorities concerned must disclose the materials on the basis of which the order was made".  The bench explained that the order of compulsory retirement cannot be based on the sole basis of recommendations of the committee which has to be considered by the competent authority in accordance with law and merely because the committee has made recommendations for retirement of a person, he cannot be compulsorily retired unless the competent authority comes to a conclusion after forming a bona fide opinion of its own that the writ petitioner can be subjected to compulsory retirement in the interest of the institution.  Dealing with the contention of the petitioner that an FIR stood registered against the petitioner by the Vigilance Organization, which later on transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation and the CBI after conducting investigation submitted the closure report before the Special Judge Anti-Corruption, which came to be accepted by the trial Court, the bench observed that compulsory retirement cannot be sustained merely because an FIR was lodged against the writ petitioner by the Vigilance Organization.  "The practice followed by the State in directing compulsory retirement of the writ petitioner was completely unwarranted because that would violate the basic maxim of "innocent until proven guilty". Thus, via the impugned order of compulsory retirement, the State has applied this principle in the reverse", the bench maintained.  The bench placed reliance on the Supreme Court judgement in State of Gujarat Versus Suryakant Chunilal Shah 1999, and observed that merely being involved in a criminal case would not per se establish the person's guilt and hence, a compulsory retirement based on such a factor would not stand. Formation of opinion for compulsory retirement is to be based on the subjective satisfaction of the authority concerned but such satisfaction must be based on a valid material and it is permissible for the courts to ascertain whether a valid material exists or otherwise, on which the subjective satisfaction of the administrative authority is based, the bench underscored.  Applying the said preposition of Law to the case at hand the bench noted that record clearly reveals that compulsory retiring the writ petitioner (Bhumesh Sharma) from service was based on no material, in as much as the writ respondent even did not conduct any departmental inquiry with respect to the act of alleged misconduct on the part of writ petitioner.  The DB further said, "even the writ petitioner has specifically claimed in the writ petition that the Transport Commissioner vide communication dated 11.07.2011 had recommended his name for gold medal for his honesty, integrity and meritorious service. In such a situation, the reputation of writ petitioner cannot be termed as doubtful, as projected, nor could his conduct be determined only on spoken words in the absence of any material on record, which was the fundamental flaw in the order issued against the petitioner compulsory retiring him from service", the bench recorded  Dismissing the appeal and while upholding the judgment of writ court the bench concluded by stating,  "Since the State has failed to disclose the material forming the basis for compulsory retiring the writ petitioner from service, as such it can be said to be a case of no material or no evidence and the same can certainly be held to be arbitrary or without application of mind", the DB said, adding "we are not inclined to take a view other than the one taken by the Single Judge."

"The age of 15-16 years or below 18 years is not the age where any young couple should enter into the institution of marriage," the Allahabad High Court observed recently as it granted bail to a man accused of raping a minor girl taking into account the larger interest of the child born out of their consensual relationship.The Bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan however clarified... "The age of 15-16 years or below 18 years is not the age where any young couple should enter into the institution of marriage, " the Allahabad High Court  observed recently as it granted bail to a man accused of raping a minor girl taking into account the larger interest of the child born out of their consensual relationship. The Bench of Justice  Rajesh Singh Chauhan however clarified that the bail order  not be cited in any other case as precedence inasmuch as the bai was granted considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the instant case. The case in brief Minor victim/prosecutrix  went to Ludhiyana with the accused/bail applicant, where the accused established physical relations with her on the promise of marriage.  Thereafter, they got married without informing their family members.  Subsequently, the girl conceived gave birth to a male child. Thereafter, the accused was booked  u/s 376, 506 IPC, & 5/6 of POSCO Act and is in jail since January 6, 2022. Now, seeking bail, he moved to the High Court. Arguments advanced Before the Court, his counsel submitted that  presently the informant/prosecutrix is living with the family members of the applicant/accused and she does not want to go to the place of her parents.  It was also contended that in her Section  161 and 164 Cr.P.C. statement, she had not leveled any allegation against the present applicant and  rather, she had stated she was willingly living with the accused. Further, filing his  affidavit, the father of the prosecutrix supported the case of the accused and submitted before the Court that his daughter is happily living with the family members of the accused. On the other hand, the state's counsel submitted that since the girl was a minor,  her consent was meaningless in the eyes of law  and therefore, the accused  should not be released on bail. Court's observations  At the very outset, the Court observed that it was pained to notice the fact that children of tender age, who have not attained the age of majority, are indulging in such type of relations which may not be said to be a proper relation.  Further, the Court remarked thus: "When a certain age has been prescribed by the statute to get married and live accordingly, any such act which has been committed prior to such age can not be approved. The age of 15-16 years or below 18 years is not the age where any young couple should enter into the institution of marriage." However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the Court noted that the accused and the prosecutrix have not only got married but they are having an infant son from said wedlock. Further, stressing that it is the responsibility of the couple to look after their child properly, the court said that if the accused is not released from jail or if he is kept in jail, there might be a possibility that his minor wife with his son might not be taken care of properly by his parents. Therefore, considering the larger interest of the child and mother, the bail plea of the accused was allowed on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.

The Madras High Court recently directed the release of a man who was sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,00,000 rupees for consciously possessing 1.5 kg Heroin for transportation to Kuwait.

The Madras High Court recently directed the release of a man who was sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,00,000 rupees for consciously possessing 1.5 kg Heroin for transportation to Kuwait. The bench of Justice G Ilanthiraiyan observed that the appellant had carried the material believing it to be wheat flour and tamarind and not a prohibited substance.  Though not in all cases, the carrier can plead absence of culpability, in the peculiar circumstances and facts of this case as narrated above, the knowledge of contraband in the Airbag cannot be attributed to the accused/appellant. Through his statement it is probablised that he had carried the parcel given by Venkateswara Rao, without knowing that it is a prohibited substance. By preponderance of probability, the accused had established the absence of knowledge.   The court thus set aside the order of conviction passed by the Special Court and directed refund of any fine amount paid.   The appellant was arrested by the authorities after getting telephonic information that one Venkateswara Rao of Chittor (since absconding), was planning to send 1 ½ Kg of Heroin by Fly Emirates Flight, through the appellant. The appellant contended that there was no culpable mental state as he carried the materials believing it to be wheat flour and tamarind given by the absconding accused.   The prosecution on the other hand submitted that the telephonic conversation between the appellant and the absconding accused would clearly prove that they were in frequent contact.   The court observed that the call records produced by the prosecution could not be accepted as these electronic evidence were not accompanied with certified under Section 65 B of the Evidence Act, 1872. At the same time, the officers who collected the call records were also not examined. Further no document was produced to prove that the cellular number belonged to the appellant. The trial Court erred in referring this inadmissible document to presume culpable mental state of the accused.   The court also noted that no effort had been taken to produce the absconding offender. Thus, the court held that the prosecution could not prove that the appellant was conscious of the presence of heroin in the parcel given to him. As a result, the court allowed the appeal.

The Kerala High Court on Wednesday held that it was necessary to obtain sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for prosecution against public servants, and that cognizance of the offences taken against them without such sanction was bad in law.

The Kerala High Court on Wednesday held that it was necessary to obtain sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for prosecution against public servants, and that cognizance of the offences taken against them without such sanction was bad in law.  Justice R Narayana Pisharadi while ruling so, dismissed a couple of revision petitions filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) challenging the order of Special CBI Judge allowing applications for discharge filed by two accused in a criminal case.  Factual Background: The Directorate of Education of Lakshadweep had directed to supply ready-made uniforms to school children in the academic year 2005-06 free of cost. A committee, called the Uniform Tender Evaluation, Sample Selection and Procurement Committee consisting of five individuals, was formed for the evaluation and finalisation of the tenders submitted for the supply of readymade uniforms.  However, pursuant to a conspiracy hatched by the members of this committee, sub-standard uniforms were purchased and false and forged entries were made on record, thereby violating the tender conditions. The committee members conspired with the other private persons doing textile business and a tailoring instructor to obtain wrongful gain for themselves in purchasing sub-standard materials and causing wrongful loss to the Lakshadweep Administration. Subsequently, one of the conspirators turned to be an approver.  Thereafter, two of the accused, namely, accused 4 and 8, filed applications for discharge before the Special Court under Section 239 of CrPC. Although these were dismissed initially, after the interference of the High Court, they were considered afresh.  Accordingly, in the light of the contention raised by the applicants that sanction under Section 197 was necessary to prosecute them, the Special Court held that the prosecution against them was bad for want of such sanction.  Aggrieved by this Order, the CBI preferred a revision petition before the Bench assailing their discharge.  Key Findings: The Court initially analysed the provision of Section 197 of the Code. Then it recalled a few judicial precedents concerning the provision.  Accordingly, reliance was placed on Amrik Singh v. State of Pepsu [AIR 1955 SC 309] where it was held as follows: "If the acts complained of are so integrally connected with the duties attaching to the office as to be inseparable from them, then sanction under Section 197(1) would be necessary; but if there was no necessary connection between them and the performance of those duties, the official status furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the acts, then no sanction would be required."   This position was reiterated in several other judgements, particularly in D.Devaraja v. Owais Sabeer Hussain [AIR 2020 SC 3292].  In the present case, it was observed that both the accused were members of the impugned committee by virtue of the offices held by them.  To decide whether sanction under Section 197 as alleged by the accused was warranted in the matter, the Court found it imperative to consider their roles in the commission of offences.  The primary allegation levelled against both of them was that they blindly accepted the certificate issued without inspecting the uniform materials, consequent to which the sub-standard materials were purchased.  As per the Order issued by the Special Court, both of them did not have expertise in the matter of quality control or checking the standards of stitching or clothes supplied.  The Bench observed that the prosecution failed to prove that the accused were experts in the field to assess the quality of dress materials. "Negligence on the part of these accused, who were not experts in the field, in accepting the certificate issued by the technical member of the committee would not take them out of the protection under Section 197(1) of the Code, which is otherwise available to them."  Therefore, the Court ruled that it cannot be found that their actions had no reasonable connection with their official duties. On the aforesaid ground, while finding no merit in the revision petitions, the Single Judge held as follows: "Therefore, it was necessary to obtain sanction under Section 197 of the Code for prosecution against them. Cognizance of the offences taken against them, without such sanction, was bad in law."  Case Title: State v. Syed Shaikoya    
The Allahabad High Court recently held that under Article 233 of the Constitution of India, a Judicial Officer, regardless of his or her previous experience, as an Advocate with 7 years practice, cannot apply and compete for appointment to any vacancy in the post of District Judge.The Bench of Justice Ashutosh Srivastava and Justice Pritinker Diwaker further clarified that his or... The Allahabad High Court recently held that under Article 233 of the Constitution of India, a Judicial Officer, regardless of his or her previous experience, as an Advocate with 7 years practice, cannot apply and compete for appointment to any vacancy in the post of District Judge. The Bench of Justice Ashutosh Srivastava and Justice Pritinker Diwaker further clarified that his or her (Judicial Officer) chance to occupy the post (of District judge) would be through promotion in accordance with the Rules framed under Article 233 and Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India.  The matter before the Court  Essentially, the Bench was hearing the plea of 5 Judicial Officers who are members of the M.P. Judicial Services and working as Judicial Officers in the State of M.P.  They contended that even though they have 7 years of experience as an advocate, they can't apply for the post of District Judge since they are judicial officers, who have been barred under Rule 5 of the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975 from applying for direct recruitment. They were aggrieved by Rule 5 of the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975 insofar as it bars the Judicial Officers from participating in the recruitment process for filing up the vacancies by direct recruitment for the post of district judges. Therefore, they moved the Court seeking declaration of the 1975 Rules as unconstitutional to the extent that it excludes the persons possessing requisite experience in the field of law of more than 7 years cumulatively as an Advocate and as a Judicial Officer for being considered eligible to appear in the U.P.H.J.S. Exams. Court's observations  The Court, at the outset, noted that under the rule in question [Rule 5 of the 1975 Rules] the source of recruitment by promotion is confined to Judicial Officers [Civil Judge (Senior Division)] while the source of direct recruitment is confined to Advocates with not less than 7 years standing. Further, the Court noted that Rules of 1975 have been framed in exercise of the power conferred by the Proviso to Article 309 read with Article 233 of the Constitution of India.  [NOTE: Article 309 of the Constitution of India deals with the recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving the Union or a State. Article 309 provides the competence for the Governor of a State or such person as he may direct to make the rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the State.  On the other hand, Article 233 of the Constitution of India deals with the appointment of District Judges.] Against this backdrop, the Court relied upon the ruling of the Apex Court in the case of Dheeraj Mor Vs. Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, wherein it was held that that civil judges are not eligible to seek direct recruitment to post of District Judges in bar quota. Eligibility under Article 233(2) of the Constitution requires 7 years of continuous practice. "Only practicing candidates can avail the quota. It is exclusively for them", the Supreme Court had held in this case. "Article 233(2) nowhere provides eligibility of in-­service candidates for consideration as a District Judge concerning a post requiring 7 years' practice as an advocate or a pleader. Requirement of 7 years' experience for advocate or pleader is qualified with a rider that he should not be in the service of the Union or the State", the Court had said in its judgment.  The Court had also said that the practice referred to in Article 233(2) is "continuous practice" as not only on the cut-off date for the selection but also on the date of appointment. "The requirement of 7 years of minimum experience has to be considered as the practising advocate as on the cut­off date, the phrase used is a continuous state of affair from the past. The context 'has been in practice' in which it has been used, it is apparent that the provisions refers to a person who has been an advocate or pleader not only on the cut­off date but continues to be so at the time of appointment", the Court had observed. Further, the Court also referred to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Deepak Aggarwal Vs. Keshav Kaushik and others [2013 (5) SCC 277] wherein it was held that one of the essential requirements articulated by the above expression in Article 233(2) is that such person must with requisite period be continuing as an advocate on the date of application. In light of the aforesaid, the Court, while dismissing the plea, held thus: "...under Article 233 of the Constitution of India, a Judicial Officer regardless of his or her previous experience, as an Advocate with 7 years practice, cannot apply and compete for appointment to any vacancy in the post of District Judge; his or her chance to occupy the post would be through promotion in accordance with the Rules framed under Article 233 and Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India." Case title - Shashank Singh And 4 Others v. Honble High Court Of Judicature At Allahabad And Another  Read Order  
The Bombay High Court on Friday acquitted Guddu Krish Yadav who was sentenced to death penalty by the Palghar sessions court in 2015 for the double murder of a colleague and his wife by allegedly pouring acid on the sleeping couple as revenge for reporting theft by Yadav to their employer.  The High Court was hearing a death confirmation petition filed by the state government as a death sentence awarded by a sessions court has to be confirmed by the High Court before it can be executed.  A Division bench of Justices Sadhana S Jadhav and Milind N Jadhav rejected the death confirmation plea, observing that the trial was conducted in the "most casual manner" and the prosecution had "suppressed and fabricated vital evidence".   "After having appreciated the entire evidence on record, the material discrepancies, lacunae and blatant illegalities, we would definitely indicate that the prosecution has utterly failed in connecting the dots and bringing home the guilt of the accused. Merely because the crime is heinous and brutal, it would not be just to get carried away sans any legal proof required to substantiate the charge of murder on the accused," the bench said.  According to the prosecution, on November 5, 2015, Yadav allegedly stole his colleague's phone, who then complained to their employer. Consequently, the employer pulled up Yadav and asked him to return the phone. This allegedly caused Yadav to seek revenge. In the wee hours of November 6, 2015, Yadav allegedly went to the company's quarters – where his colleague stayed with his wife – with a bucket of concentrated sulphuric acid and poured the same on them while they were asleep. The couple was taken to the hospital, where the husband died four hours later and the wife the next day.  The police relied on dying declarations of the couple and two other employees who were key eye witnesses to the incident. The Palghar sessions court, on May 9, 2019, convicted Yadav and sentenced him to death observing that the same was "a unique case beyond imagination and a crime of such a nature, which is undeserving of any sympathy or mercy".   Thereafter, the state government had moved the High Court seeking confirmation of Yadav's death sentence. Yadav argued that as per material on record, there was major discrepancy and contradiction about the time of the deaths and thus, the dying declarations cannot be admitted as evidence.  The court noted that it was amply clear after going through the evidence of the doctor and the nurse who first attended the murdered couple that they were not conscious enough to record a dying declaration.  The bench noted that "the evidence led by the prosecution is fraught with major inconsistencies… The trial was conducted in the most casual manner and whether it was just and fair in a capital punishment case is a question remaining unanswered. The quality and credibility of the evidence adduced is not even up to the mark…".   Referring to the Supreme court case of Ashish Batham Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 2002 Supreme Court 3206, wherein it was held that charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of clear, cogent, credible or unimpeachable evidence and the question of indicting or punishing an accused does not arise, merely carried away by heinous nature of the crime or the gruesome manner in which it was found to have been committed, the bench came to the unequivocal conclusion that the prosecution has not only suppressed vital evidence but deliberately fabricated the dying declaration of the deceased, which forms the basis of its case. Yadav was thus acquitted.  Case Title: The State of Maharashtra Vs Guddu Krish Yadav

The Supreme Court has recently quashed an order of the Jharkhand High Court in an anticipatory bail case, seeking the personal presence of State officials for the "betterment of the criminal justice system." A division bench comprising Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Krishna Murari took objection to the impugned judgment and cautioned High Courts against "unnecessary summoning officers" in a matter that has come to an end. The bench was hearing an appeal against the Jharkhand High Court order on 9th and 13th April 2021. The Court held that once an anticipatory bail is granted and confirmed, that would generally be the end of the matter. Regarding the intention of "betterment of the criminal justice system," the Court held that it is a matter that can be best taken up as public interest litigation. "For that purpose, the relevant papers should be placed before the Hon'bleHon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court on the Administrative Side for examination whether the factual scenario calls upon the matter to entertained as a public interest litigation or not. If it is so entertained, then it should be so registered only as a public interest litigation." The impugned summoning was passed by a Single Bench on 09.04.2021. Vide the said orders; it had sought the personal appearance of Dr. Swapan Kumar Sarak, the doctor, who had conducted the autopsy of the deceased and allegedly failed to disclose the fact that the deceased was pregnant. However, after having received the ultrasound reports annexed to the application for anticipatory bail, the Court added Mr. Sarak as a party-respondent and issue summons holding as follows:  "The autopsy of deceased Anjum Bano has been conducted by Dr. Swapan Kumar Sarak, but in the post-mortem report, he has not mentioned the premature termination of pregnancy of the deceased soon before her death. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court had warned the High Courts against 'the frequent, casual and lackadaisical summoning of high officials' ' and advised to exercise its power with responsibility and issue summons only in compelling situations and ''not merely to humiliate them''. 
The Gujarat High Court has held that merely because an employee appointed to Class-IV post is handed over additional duties with respect to a higher post for a temporary period, may be during the leave vacancy of actual employee, cannot demand entire salary differential.The Court took into account the differential aspect of appointment in Class-IV and Class-III category and concluded that... The Gujarat High Court has held that merely because an employee appointed to Class-IV post is handed over additional duties with respect to a higher post for a temporary period, may be during the leave vacancy of actual employee, cannot demand entire salary differential. The Court took into account the differential aspect of appointment in Class-IV and Class-III category and concluded that merely because the petitioner, a Class-IV workman was doing additional work of Class-III category, it did not imply that he will be entitled to the pay-scale of Class-III post.  In the instant case, the workman was appointed to the post of a Ward-boy and would take additional responsibilities of a Telephone Operator which was a Class-III post. In such a case, the workman was not entitled to salary differential between the two posts. Justice Kogje explained the fallacy in the Industrial Tribunal's order in the following manner: "The requirement of the Recruitment Rules specifies that a Ward-boy only to be literate and there is no specification with regard to selection process whereas… post of Telephone Operator being Class-III, the post had prescribed qualification of SSC pass and experience of Telephone Exchange and such person would be eligible for selection process. This being the most important aspect, the Industrial Tribunal ought not to have granted the pay scale of Class-III post to the respondent, who was admittedly appointed on the post of a Ward-boy." The Petitioner-Corporation herein challenged the IT's order directing him to grant INR 5.4 lacs as differential amount in salary by treating the Respondent-workman as a Telephone Operator in place of a Ward-boy. It was asserted that only in the times of necessity, was the workman required to undertake duties of a Telephone Operator. The workman as a Ward-by had not undergone any selection procedure, as well. Therefore, he could claim only 'charge allowance' at best for the additional work. Per contra, the workman insisted that the Tribunal had take into consideration the duties discharged to conclude that the workman was entitled to the salary differential. Further, the Petitioner had also issued internal advertisement for appointment to the post of a Telephone Operator amongst the existing employees which included the workman. Perusing these contentions, the Bench observed that the workman, due to past knowledge of telephone operation, undertook the duties by a 'stop-gap arrangement.' The duties were never constant or continuous. It was 'misleading' to state that the workman had performed the duty on a permanent vacant post since 1998. No such entry was made in the service book of the workman, as well. A Ward-boy could not be legally appointed to the Telephone Operator (Class-III), per the Bench. There was also no explanation as to why the Petitioner had waited for almost 11 years to raise the industrial dispute in 2009. Per Justice Kogje, the Tribunal had failed to consider that the Ward-boy's work was more physical than the Telephone Operator's. Thus, the workman got advantage out of his own choice to work as an Operator. Keeping in view these factors, the Bench set aside the Tribunal's order granting salary differential. However, considering that the workman had worked as an operator at times, he was entitled to INR 2 lacs as difference in salary and not the entire wage differential.

Coming to the aid of Old Delhi's popular Mughlai food outlet "Karim's", the Delhi High Court has restrained Mumbai based businessman Kareem Dhanani from opening any further restaurants under deceptively similar marks, till August 8. Justice Prathibha M. Singh further directed Dhanani to ensure that in the restaurants run by him or by his franchises, no representation is made to the customers that it is associated with the Karim's at Jama Masjid. The order released on Monday further stated, "At least two public notices shall be issued in prominent newspapers having circulation in Maharashtra and in North India, that the Defendant's restaurant KAREEM'S is not associated with the Plaintiff's - KARIM HOTEL PVT LTD or KARIM/KARIM'S/KAREEM Restaurant from Jama Masjid or Delhi. The said notices shall be published by the next date. All the advertisements and promotional materials, menu cards, etc. including all promotions on social media and online platforms, shall carry a prominent disclaimer to the following effect: "No connection with KARIM'S Jama Masjid/Delhi"." The development comes in a trademark infringement suit filed by Delhi-based Karim's stated to be running since 1913. Dhanani himself is running 41 restaurants, including 3 international outlets at Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Canada. He admittedly adopted the trade name "Kareem's" in 2003. Thus, the Court noted that Dhanani adopted the impugned mark almost 90 years after the Plaintiff's adoption.  "Considering the fact that the Plaintiff is the prior user, adopter and owner of the marks "KARIM/KARIM'S/KARIMS", the continued use of the said mark by the Defendant would result in passing off and deception. However, the Defendant having opened 41 restaurants already as per the listset out above, this Court is of the opinion that a balance would have to be struck so as to ensure that neither party is prejudiced irreparably. Owing to the long adoption of the Plaintiff's marks "KARIM/KARIM'S/KARIMS" and the goodwill and reputation which the Plaintiff's restaurants enjoy, not only in India but internationally," the Court said  The plaintiff claimed that they came to now of the defendant's mark in 2014. At that stage, the Plaintiff initially issued a legal notice on 25th February, 2015 which was replied to by the Defendant on 11th March, 2015. The Plaintiff also filed a suit titled Karim Hotels Pvt. Ltd. v. Karims A. Dhanani, against the Defendant. In the said suit, the Defendant took a plea that it has a registration dated 4th February, 2005 for the device mark/logo "KARIMS'S" bearing. Considering the said registration, the Plaintiff had filed a petition seeking cancellation of the Defendant's mark before the IPAB, Mumbai.  The following order was passed in the aforesaid suit:  "The plaintiff has filed a proceeding before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (for short 'IPAB') for cancellation of the defendant's mark. Present suit is being repeatedly adjourned since 17th February, 2016 to await the outcome of the IPAB. This Court is of the opinion that no fruitful purpose would be served by repeatedly adjourning the present suit as not only the proceedings before the IPAB are bound to take time, but any order passed by the IPAB may be challenged by either of the parties. Consequently, the present suit and pending applications are disposed of with liberty to the plaintiffs to file an appropriate proceeding after the IPAB has disposed of the proceeding for Cancellation of the defendant's mark and the said order has attained finality. The rights and contentions of all parties are left open."  In the present suit, the plaintiff submitted that the Defendant now has large number of franchisees in various cities. There is enormous confusion being caused between the Plaintiff's and the Defendant's restaurants. The mark of the Plaintiff is also being diluted. Further the Court was informed that the cancellation petition which was filed before the IPAB is still pending and no proceedings have taken place.  Considering the aforesaid circumstances, the Court granted interim relief to the Plaintiff and directed the Respondent to place on record his written statement/reply by 5th July, along with copies of the franchise agreements entered into by him with his various franchisees. The matter will now be taken up on 8 August. Both parties have been asked to remain present on the said date to explore amicable resolution.  Case Title: KARIM HOTEL PVT LTD versus KAREEM DHANANI    
The Kerala High Court on Friday observed that a complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act through power of attorney holder is perfectly legal and competent. However, the power of attorney holder can depose and verify on oath before the Court in order to prove the contents of a complaint, only when he has witnessed the transaction as an agent of the payee/ holder in due course or possess due knowledge regarding the said transactions.  Justice A. Badharudeen further observed that the complainant has to make specific assertions as to the knowledge of the power of attorney in the said transaction explicitly in the complaint.  It is true that as per the ratio in A.C Narayanan first case (A.C.Narayanan v. State of Maharashtra &anr), the complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act through power of attorney holder is perfectly legal and competent. But the power of attorney holder could depose and verify on oath before the court in order to prove the contents of the complaint, only when the power of attorney holder must have witnessed the transaction as an agent of the payee/holder in due course or possess due knowledge regarding the said transactions and also it is required by the complainant to make specific assertion as to the knowledge of the power of attorney holder in the said transaction explicitly in the complaint and the power of attorney holder, who has no knowledge regarding the transactions. If the above stipulations are not satisfied, the power of attorney could not depose and verify on oath before the court. If the aforesaid stipulations are not satisfied the power of attorney cannot depose and verify on oath before the Court. The Petition was filed under Section 482 of the CrPC seeking to quash an order passed by Special Judicial First Class Magistrate (NI Act Cases) dismissing the petition filed and the complaint filed, pointing out that in the address portion of the complaint, it has been averred that the complainant was represented by his power of attorney holder, but there is no mention of this fact in the body of the complaint. Further, the power of attorney holder had to verify the complaint as if he was the complainant.  The Counsel appearing for the petitioner argued that the complaint was filed ignoring the statutory mandates as laid down by the Apex Court in A.C. Narayanan v. State of Maharashtra & anr. The Counsel also argued that the Affidavit filed along with the complaint does not include anything regarding the direct knowledge of the power of attorney holder regarding the transaction and that he had witnessed the transaction. The Counsel appearing for the 2nd Respondent averred that there are no truth in the contentions raised by the petitioner and argued that certain relevant documents produced before the Trial Court were suppressed. It was also argued that the complainant himself had filed a proof affidavit under Section 145 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, as he proposed to give evidence regarding the transaction that led to the execution of the cheque.  The Court after considering the contentions raised observed that even though the complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act through the power of attorney holder is perfectly legal and competent, the power of attorney holder can depose and verify on oath before the court in order to prove the contents of the complaint, only when the power of attorney holder must have witnessed the transaction as an agent of the payee/holder in due course or possess due knowledge regarding the said transactions and also it is required by the complainant to make a specific assertion as to the knowledge of the power of attorney holder in the said transaction explicitly in the complaint. The Court also observed that the Lower Court took cognizance in this matter and registered the case with the intention to follow the procedure of summary trial and section 264 of Cr.P.C deals with judgment in cases tried summarily and it has been provided that in every case tried summarily in which the accused does not plead guilty, the Magistrate shall record the substance of the evidence and a judgment containing a brief statement of the reasons for the finding.  In fact, Section 264 does not provide for the acquittal of the accused before trial. Therefore, the petition was found to be defective at the very inception, the Court added.  However, looking into the way in which the complaint was filed the Court observed that the Lower Court took cognizance of the matter acting on the affidavit filed by the power of attorney holder under Section 145 of the NI Act. However, the Court pointed out that there are no averments in the complaint that the power of attorney had witnessed transactions as an agent of payee in due course or possess due knowledge regarding the said transaction and also there is no specific assertion as to the knowledge of the power of attorney holder in the said transaction explicitly in the complaint. In view of the above, the cognizance taken by the Magistrate acting on the affidavit of the power of attorney holder is found to be illegal and the same shall stand set aside, the Court observed.  The Court thereby allowed the Criminal Miscellaneous Case by reverting the complaint back to the pre-cognizance stage, with liberty to the original complainant to file an affidavit under Section 145 of the N.I Act in his capacity.  Advocate Rajiv Nambisan appeared for the Petitioner. Advocates Jagan Abraham M George, Jaison Antony and Public Prosecutor G. Sudheer appeared for the Respondents.  Case Title: Razak Mether v.

The Gujarat High Court has reiterated that a lawyer who does not appear and plead before courts cannot designate himself as an "Advocate" even if he is enrolled with the Bar Council. It added that as per the Advocates Act and the Bar Council Rules, once the terms of employment do not require an advocate to plead and appear before the Courts, then during this period of employment, a person cannot be termed as an 'Advocate' because he is not practising as one.  "The term "an advocate" has been interpreted as one where mere enrollment at the Bar Council would not by itself entitle the Petitioners to claim to have the requisite qualification as the as the same has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in the case of Deepak Aggarwal (supra) as being actually pleading and appearing before the Courts which the Petitioners have not..." a single bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav said.  The observation was made while hearing two pleas whereby the Petitioners, aspiring for the post of Joint Charity Commissioner in the General State Service, were declared ineligible due to lack of requisite experience as Advocate as per Recruitment Rules. The Rules prescribed 10 years experience as the minimum requirement.  The primary contention of the Petitioners was that the Rules required the candidate should be enrolled under the Advocates Act 1961 for not less than 10 years and the Petitioners were compliant with the same. Merely because they were employed did not imply that they would lose their enrollment. The enrollment continues even if he is employed as his name is not removed from the rolls but only kept under suspension. Reference was made to R.Sreekanth and Others versus Kerala Public Service Commission, WP No. 3185 of 2009 to bolster these contentions.   Per contra, the GPSC relied extensively on the Deepak Aggarwal versus Keshav Kaushik and Others 2013 (5) SCC 277 to argue that an advocate essentially means an individual who is actually practising before the Courts. If they are employed and not acting or pleading as per this definition, then they become a mere employee and not an 'Advocate' as expressed in the Advocates Act.  Justice Vaishnav noted that in the Sreekanth judgement, the Kerala High Court had held that what is suspended during the employment of the Advocate in service is not enrollment because suspension of the certificate of practice does not imply that the enrollment on the rolls of the Bar Council ceases.   However, in the Deepak Aggarwal case, the meaning of 'Advocate' or 'Pleader' was adjudicated by the Supreme Court. The Court therein had relied on Sushma Suri v Govt.(NCT of Delhi), 1999 (1) SCC 330 to hold that if a person being enrolled as an Advocate ceases to practise and takes up employment then such a person can 'by no stretch of imagination be termed as an Advocate.'  Referring to Rule 49 of the Bar Council of India Rules, the Justice Vaishnav opined "if an Advocate by virtue of taking up employment does not plead or act as a pleader then as per the terms of his engagement that he becomes a mere employee and therefore the Bar Council has understood the expression "advocate" as one who is actually practicing before courts."  In Deepak Aggarwal as well, the Apex Court had perused Sec 35(4) of the Advocates Act to clarify that where an Advocate is suspended from practice, he is debarred from practising before any court. Therefore, if the object of surrendering certificate of practise is considered, it implies that a person ceases to be an advocate.  Thus, the Court concluded:  "The continuance of his name on the rolls of the Bar Council is of no consequence as far as his right to practice is considered and such a person cannot designate himself as an advocate."  Keeping in view these precedents, the High Court dismissed the petitions and declined to find fault with the GPSC order.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently quashed the charge-sheet and consequential proceedings in a case registered for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act), observing that the investigating agency proceeded for prosecution based on half-baked material, and that allowing trial to proceed on the basis of the same would be an exercise in futility, inevitably resulting... The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently quashed the charge-sheet and consequential proceedings in a case registered for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act), observing that the investigating agency proceeded for prosecution based on half-baked material, and that allowing trial to proceed on the basis of the same would be an exercise in futility, inevitably resulting in the discharge of the accused.  The division bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav was essentially dealing an application under Section 482 of CrPC, seeking directions of the Court to quash the charge-sheet and the consequential proceedings against the Applicant for offence under Section 7 of the PC Act.  The question before the Court was whether the charge-sheet could be quashed when the only evidence collected during the investigation was as follows-  Written complaint of the Complainant;A recorded conversation between the Complainant and Applicant, which the FSL reported to be not clear enough to match with the sample voice of the Applicant;Statement of shadow witness, who merely saw the Complainant and Applicant sitting in the car, but did not hear the conversation between them.  The Applicant argued that even if the the aforesaid available evidence collected by prosecution during investigation was to be accepted on its face value, it could not lead to commission of an offence punishable under Section 7 of the PC Act, as alleged. It was further submitted that there were certain other undisputed facts, which revealed patent improbability of the incident and the foundational complaint being malicious.  The Court noted that in the instant case, the facts revealed that besides the written complaint of the Complainant and the statement of the shadow witness under Section 161 CrPC, there was no other implicative piece of evidence collected by the prosecution. The Court further opined that the said complaint could've metamorphized into filing of charge-sheet, had the voice in the DVR matched with the voice sample collected from Petitioner, but that was not the case.  The Court held that the investigating agency ought to collect implicative evidence to substantiate a written compliant. It observed that mere registration of cases based on written complaint, without implicative evidence would result in disastrous consequences-  "In an offence punishable u/S. 7 of the PC Act, the least that is required of the Investigating Agency is to collect implicative evidence/material to support the allegation contained in the written complaint. In absence of any such supportive implicative material/evidence, if an offence is registered, merely on the basis of written complaint of complainant, then disastrous consequence can befall upon all public servants thereby exposing them to registration of offence and filing of charge-sheet." It added, "A written complaint can be made by any person who nurses a grudge or prejudice against the public servant. The public servant would stand exposed to criminal prosecution on the mere making of a written complaint. This scenario would led to chaos in the administration of service. The public servant shall not be able to discharge his official duties in a free and fair manner due to the ever present feeling of lurking fear in the mind that any act of discharge of official duties can trigger a criminal prosecution."  Placing its reliance on the jurisprudence laid out by the Supreme Court with regard to the subject concerned, the Court further opined-  For an allegation to mature into an FIR, least that is required is that the allegation/first information discloses commission of cognizable offence. Whereas for an FIR to mature into a charge-sheet/final report u/S.173(2) Cr.P.C., it has to undergo the arduous journey from Sec.154 to Sec. 176 (Chapter XII) Cr.P.C. where implicative evidence if any is collected in support of the FIR in a unilateral process called investigation.  Investigation is a unilateral process, being out of bounds for the accused. The investigating agency is thus expected to act in a free, fair and impartial manner with no element of prejudice coming into play for or against the accused or victim. Investigation as is well known is a probe in the dark starting from the known to the unknown moving backwards in time, in search of truth. The Court reiterated that the investigating agency is obliged, while discharging its statutory duty under Chapter XII CrPC, to ensure that the final report under Section 173(1) CrPC, if prepared and filed before the court, is accompanied with such supportive/corroborative evidence which gives rise to serious and strong suspicion of involvement of accused in the offence alleged. Another test, the Court noted, to confirm the validity and lawfulness of charge-sheet/final report would be to see if the evidence/material contained therein is left uncontroverted, which would ensure that the same could sustain a conviction.  Considering the material placed on record in the case in hand, the Court held that the same was not enough for filing a report under Section 173 CrPC and for further taking cognizance. It also noted that the investigating agency should've ideally pursued a fresh exercise to record statement of the Applicant to implicate him after learning that the evidence that they had collected was not implicative. The Court observed-  Pertinently when the Investigating Agency was faced with a non- implicative Forensic Report then the only option available to the Investigating Agency was to go in for a fresh exercise of recording of statement of petitioner by laying of another trap. Instead, the Investigating Agency decided to proceed with the half baked material in shape of written complaint and the statement of shadow witness – Constable Dinesh Dubey, who had not even heard the conversation between petitioner and the complainant. This kind of an exercise by Investigating Agency amounts to utter abuse of process of Court. The charge-sheet filed is thus a waste of precious time of the Court which would be involved in a trial where discharge is inevitable and fait accompli.  Regard being had to the above, this case is one of those rarest of rare cases where without entering into the reliability, genuineness or veracity of the evidence collected, this Court is compelled to invoke it's inherent powers u/S.482 Cr.P.C. to truncate the prosecution which in turn is based on premature investigation.  With the aforesaid observations, the Court decided to quash the charge-sheet filed in the case and the consequential proceedings followed by it.  Case Title: Narendra Mishra v.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Wednesday called for a jail status report from the Director-General, Prison and Correctional Services (Madhya Pradesh) with regard to arrangements made to keep the male and female inmates as well as under trials and convicted inmates in separate jails. The order came from the Bench of Justice Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava while dealing with a bail plea filed in connection with an offence registered under Section 34(2) of the M.P. Excise Act. It has been alleged that from the possession of the applicants, namely, Roma Kanjar and Hemlata Kanjar 600 bulk liters of liquor was recovered, however, they have denied the said allegations. Importantly, it was submitted by the counsel for the applicants that they have been in Datia jail since July 27, 2021, and being a lady, it is very tough for them to accommodate in the jail custody, as the female and male offenders/ undertrials are kept in the same campus in jail custody.  It was also contended that Investigation and trial will take its own time. As the applicants are ladies and they are in custody since 27/7/2021, therefore, it was prayed that they be granted bail. In this backdrop, the bail application was allowed and it was directed that they shall be released on bail on each of them furnishing a personal bond of Rs.1,00,000/-. However, before parting with the matter, the court called for the jail status report from the Director-General, Prison and Correctional Services (M.P.) with regard to arrangements made to keep the male and female inmates as well as under trials and convicted inmates in separate jails.  The State has been directed to submit the aforesaid report before Principal Registrar of this Court within a period of one month, who in turn has been directed to place the same on the administrative side.  The Court directed that the copy of the order be sent to the trial Court concerned as well as State counsel for necessary compliance. The registry has been asked to communicate the order to Director General, Prison and Correctional Services (M.P.) for compliance. Case title - Roma Kanjar and others v.

Setting aside the conviction order passed against a Husband for abetting the suicide of his wife, the Allahabad High Court last week held that separating wife from his own life could not be a reason which could come under the category of the abetment.  The Bench of Justice Ajai Tyagi was hearing an appeal filed by one Jagveer Singh Alias Bantu who had been convicted under Sections 498-A & 306 IPC by Additional Sessions Judge, Pilibhit.  Facts in brief   On December 14, 2008, a written report was submitted by the informant in P.S.- Jahanabad, District- Pilibhit, with the averments that his grand-daughter, who was married to Jagveer Singh (appellant), had been killed. It was evident that she was given poison.  The prosecution case was that the appellant and his parents were not satisfied with the dowry given in the marriage of the deceased and that they used to demand additional dowry and torturing the deceased for not meeting out the same.   In her post mortem report, aluminum phosphide poison was found in the viscera of the deceased, therefore, a charge sheet was submitted against the applicant and his father under Section 498A, 304B IPC and Section ¾ Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.  Importantly, a suicide note, written by the deceased, was the main basis of this case, which was found by Investigating Officer from the room of the deceased.   On believing the averments of suicide-note, the trial court acquitted the father of the appellant and convicted the appellant under Section 306 IPC and under Section 498A IPC.  High Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that the trial court had found that the appellant used to torture the deceased mentally and that he had created such a situation before the deceased by separating her from his life that she was not left with any other option but to commit suicide and therefore, the Trial Court held him guilty of abetting the suicide of wife.   However, the High Court opined that this finding of the trial court was not in consonance with the settled position of law regarding abetment, as the Court noted that before a person may be said to have abetted the commission of suicide, he must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing a certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide.  Significantly, the court noted that in order to bring the case under Section 306 IPC, it must have been proved that the husband instigated the deceased to commit suicide or that he engaged with one or more persons in any conspiracy to abet the deceased to commit suicide or that he intentionally aided by any act for abetting her to commit suicide.  Now, referring to the facts of the case, the Court noted thus:  "…the trial court has referred the suicide-note left by the deceased which shows the sole reason of committing the suicide by the deceased was that she was separated by the appellant from his life. In the opinion of this Court, the aforesaid reason could not be the reason which could come under the category of the abetment. There is absolutely nothing in the suicide-note, which would make him responsible for an offence under Section 306 IPC…The aforesaid suicide note does not show any mens rea on the part of the appellant."  Lastly, underscoring that if the appellant had separated the deceased from his life, it was not compelling reason which put the deceased in a situation where she had no option but to commit suicide, the Court allowed the appeal and conviction and sentence of the appellant as awarded was set aside.

The Supreme Court observed that mere delay in intimating the insurance company about the occurrence of the theft cannot be a ground to deny the insurance claim. In this case, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, set aside the claim of compensation on account of theft of vehicle on the ground that the delay of 78 days in not informing the Insurance Company of the theft is fatal.   The complainant had purchased a Mahindra & Mahindra Major Jeep which was stolen outside the office of a liquor shop, in which he was a partner. The vehicle was insured with the |United India Insurance Co. Ltd. According to the complainant, he informed the Insurance Company about the theft of vehicle on phone, but the written complaint was made later. The complaint was allowed by the District Consumer Redressal Forum and an award was passed to pay the insured amount, i.e. Rs. 3,40,000/- to the complainant with 12% interest. The appeal filed by the Insurance Company against the said order was dismissed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The appellant-complainant before the Apex Court relied on the judgment in Gurshinder Singh Vs. Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd. & Anr.,  (2020) 11 SCC 612, in which the following observations were made: "when an insured has lodged the FIR immediately after the theft of a vehicle occurred and when the police after investigation have lodged a final report after the vehicle was not traced and when the surveyors/investigators appointed by the insurance company have found the claim of the theft to be genuine, then mere delay in intimating the insurance company about the occurrence of the theft cannot be a ground to deny the claim of the insured." The insurance company, on the other hand, contended that delay in lodging an FIR is an important step in examining the claim of the appellant, since as per the appellant himself, the report was lodged after 7 days of the incident. Therefore, the claim filed by the complainant was rightly rejected by the NCDRC.  The bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian noted that the case of Insurance Company throughout was based upon delay in intimation to the Insurance Company. Therefore, in respect of the argument that the FIR was delayed, the said arguments need not be examined in this case, the court said while allowing the appeal and restoring the order passed by the District Forum  Case name: Dharamender Vs.

The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has made it clear that the presumption of innocence in favour of a juvenile under Section 3(i) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 cannot be applied to the adult co-accused in a crime. Justice Sanjay Dhar thus rejected the contention raised by the Petitioners herein (co-accused with the juvenile) that since the main accused, being a juvenile, is to be presumed free of any malafide intent, the petitioners cannot be roped in by invoking the provisions contained in Section 34 of the IPC.  Section 3(i) of the JJ Act provide that any child shall be presumed to be an innocent of any mala fide or criminal intent up to the age of eighteen years. The juvenile herein was accused of giving a fatal blow to the deceased, following which he and the co-accused (Petitioners herein) were charged under Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 of IPC. The Petitioners had challenged the charge while contending that since in view of Section 3(i) of JJ Act, juvenile accused has to be presumed innocent of any mala fide or criminal intent, thus if the main accused is to be presumed free of any mala fide intent, the petitioners cannot be roped in by invoking the provisions contained in Section 34 of the IPC. Disagreeing, the High Court observed, "The argument advanced by learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners appears to be misconceived for the reason that presumption under Section 3(i) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, is applicable to the case of juvenile accused i.e. Jan Mohammad Changa and not to the cases of other adult accused, who, from the circumstances appearing in the material on record of the case, clearly shared a common intention of launching a murderous attack on the complainant party. The contention of learned senior counsel is, therefore, without any merit." The Court also refused to grant bail to accused persons in wake of prima facie material available on record of challan.  The order of the Trial Court was challenged on various counts, primarily, for not satisfying the ingredients of Section 302 read with sec 34 of IPC.   The petitioners dubbed the occurrence wherein a man was killed as "sudden fight" and contended petitioners could not be said to have shared a common intention to commit the murder.   The Court delved into the factors that are to be taken into account while framing charges and also the scope of the High Court to interfere with the order vide which the Trial court frames charges against the accused.   Drawing guidance from the Apex Court judgement, Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and Anr. the court observed at the stage of framing of charges the Trial Court is not required to see the possibility of the final guilt of the accused in the offence but the court has to see, from the material on record, whether the ingredients constituting offences are prima facie made out.   "For this limited purpose, sifting of evidence is permissible but probative value of the material brought on record by the prosecution cannot be gone into at this stage."   The court also clarified, in light of the law laid down by Apex Court, that the scope of High Court to interfere with the order of framing of charges is limited to cases where the court finds no offence is made out or where there is a legal bar to prosecution.   The contention of the petitioners that sec 34 doesn't attract because the deceased person had arrived at the place of occurrence when the scuffle had already commenced was rejected.  The court said it is not necessary that common intention must have developed before reaching the spot of occurrence. The common intention between assailants may develop on reaching the spot. There cannot be any direct evidence but the circumstances prevailing at the time of commission of crime may give sufficient indication as to the intention, the court said.  Contention raised by the counsel for petitioner about contradictions in the statement of witnesses' recorded under section 161 and 164 of Cr.P.C also met rejection vide this observation: "[courts] can not meticulously examine or sift the statements of witnesses recorded during investigation of the case in order to determine the effect of contradictions..."  Court said all the prosecution witnesses have attributed same thing to the Juvenile (who caused death of the deceased) and other accused persons, i.e the Juvenile was driving the tractor and was accompanied by other accused persons who were armed with Lathis.  At the time of framing of charges, the court said, contradictions in the statements of witnesses may not help the case of petitioners.  Case Title : TAJA BEGUM & ORS v UT OF J&K    
The Allahabad High Court recently observed that the cancellation of bail cannot be done without giving notice to the accused and giving him an opportunity of being heard.  With this, the bench of Justice Ajai Kumar Srivastava-I sets aside the order of the Sessions Judge, Raebareli cancelling the bail granted earlier to Rajendra Kumar and 2 others in connection with a criminal case.  The High Court noted that the impugned order cancelling the bail was passed without issuing notice to the applicants/accused and without affording them a reasonable and sufficient opportunity of hearing and the same was patently illegal being in flagrant violation of Supreme Court rulings.  In this regard, the Court referred to Apex Court's rulings in the cases of Samarendra Nath Bhattacharjee vs. State of W.B. and another (2004) 11 SCC 165, Mehboob Dawood Shaikh vs. State of Maharashtra (2004) 2 SCC 362, and P.K. Shaji alias Thammanam Shaji vs. State of Kerala (2005) 13 SCC 283.  Essentially, in the instant case, the applicants/accused were granted bail vide by the Sessions Judge, Raebareli on November 22, 2021. However, the court was later informed that the accused allegedly threatened the witnesses and the complainant to desist from prosecuting the case after being granted bail.  Therefore, finding that the aforesaid conduct of the applicants was violative of the conditions of bail subject to which they were enlarged on bail, the trial court directed that the applicants be taken into custody and also passed the impugned order cancelling the bail granted to the applicants.  Challenging the order, the Applicants moved the Court arguing that in this case, their bail was cancelled without giving them any opportunity of being heard.  In view of this, the Court, at the outset noted that it is a settled law that once bail has been granted by a competent court after due consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the same should not be cancelled in a mechanical manner without there being any supervening circumstance(s) which are not conducive to the fair trial.  "It cannot be cancelled on a prayer or request from the side of the complainant/ investigating agency/ victim, unless and until, it is shown to the satisfaction of the court concerned that the same is being misused and is no longer conducive, in the interest of justice, to allow the accused persons any further to remain on bail. No doubt, the bail can be cancelled only in those discerning few cases where it is established that a person to whom the concession of bail has been granted, is misusing the same," the Court further remarked as it set aside the impugned order and directed to release the applicants after obtaining the fresh personal bonds and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned.  However, the Court did make it clear that trial court would be at liberty to issue notice to the applicants stating therein the grounds which are to be considered by it for cancellation of bail granted to the applicants.

The Allahabad High Court has allowed the state government's application to withdraw a criminal case against Uttar Pradesh Minister of State for Health, Mayankeswar Saran Singh. The Bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh observed that when the complainant himself is not supporting the prosecution case, then there is no chance of conviction of the accused in the case and thus, withdrawal from prosecution would be in the interest of justice.  With this, the Court allowed a revision application filed by the State Government challenging the order passed by the Special Judge/M.P./M.L.A./ VI-Additional Sessions Judge, Raebareli in 2020 wherein it had dismissed the plea moved by the Public Prosecutor for withdrawal from prosecution. The case in brief Essentially, the matter dates back to the year 2007, when, during the assembly elections, Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh (the then MLA and Minister) was contesting as a Samajwadi Party Candidate against his rival candidate, Bahujan Samaj Party's Dinesh Pratap Singh.  A supporter of Dinesh had lodged an FIR against Mayankeshwar and about 20 of his people under Sections 147, 148, 149, 307, 436, 397, 395, 323, 504, 506, 427 IPC and 2(3) U.P. Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act alleging that he along with 20-25 people had sprinkled petrol on the house of the complainant and set it on fire After an investigation into the case, the police filed the charge sheet, upon which the court summoned all the accused after taking cognizance on July 13, 2009. However, in 2019, the state government decided to withdraw the case, but, PP's application filed under Section 321 CrPC [Withdrawal from prosecution] was dismissed by the MP MLA Court. Court's observations At the outset, the Court noted that the Public Prosecutor had filed the application under Section 321 Cr.P.C. in good faith after careful consideration of the material available on record.  The Court also noted that the FIR in the instant matter got registered because of political rivalry and that, later on, the complainant himself had submitted an application before the trial Court that he had no objection if the application is allowed, and his earlier objection on application under Section 321 Cr.P.C. for withdrawal from prosecution be ignored. In view of this, observing that it would be appropriate to allow the application for withdrawal from prosecution, the Court remarked thus: "The Court is required to consider whether withdrawal from prosecution would further cause of justice or not and whether it would be in the public interest to allow the withdrawal from prosecution. When the complainant himself is not supporting the prosecution case, this Court is of the view that there is no chance of conviction of the accused in the case. The case has been remained pending since 2007 and continuance of trial would be nothing but a futile exercise and Court's precious time would get wasted for futile exercise, if the application for withdrawal from prosecution is not allowed." In view thereof, the Court said that the view taken by the Special Judge does not appear to be the correct view, and therefore, allowing the revision, the Court also allowed the application for withdrawal from prosecution.

Dismissing a petition filed by an Accountant challenging his dismissal from service on being convicted in a criminal case, the Delhi High has observed that reinstatement in public service cannot flow as a matter of right where the acquittal of such person is not an honourable acquittal.  The petitioner who was working at the post of Accountant Grade I had approached the Court challenging the order dated March 19, 2013 whereby he was dismissed from service under Rule 19(i) of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 based upon his conviction under sec. 7 and 15 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 on the ground that the petitioner tried to extract a bribe for processing the release of an amount outstanding to a vendor.  The High Court had then vide order dated May 4, 2020 acquitted and exonerated the petitioner from all charges. "Given the nature of the offence for which the petitioner was proceeded against, and the conviction having been set aside only on a technical ground that the offence could not be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, and the acquittal not being an honourable acquittal, it must be held that the reinstatement of the petitioner cannot flow as a matter of right," Justice V Kameswar Rao observed.  It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that he was entitled to the benefits of the 6th and 7th Pay Commission and also promotion to the higher rank of Senior Accountant in the revised pay-scales along with usual allowances as per rules, which similarly placed employees of the respondent were receiving. It was submitted that the allegations against the petitioner were been established by way of a regular departmental inquiry and that he was denied reasonable opportunity to defend himself. It was argued that no inquiry was held according to procedure established by the competent authority prior to imposing the penalty of dismissal from service. According to the petitioner, such an action was violative of Article 311 of the Constitution of India.  On the other hand, it was the case of the respondent that the petition was not maintainable in the absence of any communication stating that the CBI had no intention of challenging the said Judgment before the Supreme Court. It was argued that it is a settled law that the competent authority can still decide whether the services of the petitioner should be reinstated or dispensed of in view of his conduct of demanding bribe from a vendor. It was also submitted that the acquittal of the petitioner was not an honourable acquittal and that the same was not on merits and the petitioner was merely accorded the benefit of doubt. According to the respondent, in such a case, there was no obligation on it's part to necessarily reinstate the services of the petitioner. "…. the nature of the charges levied against petitioner, coupled with the fact that he was merely accorded the benefit of doubt on account of the failure of the prosecution to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt, would cast a shadow of doubt, in the eyes of the employer, insofar as his suitability for re-employment / reinstatement in public service is concerned," the Court said.  The Court noted that while there are no standards in service jurisprudence as to how integrity, honesty and trustworthiness of an employee can be measured, the meaning of such terms in general parlance has to be taken into accord.  "No doubt, the prosecution of the petitioner, who was an accountant in public service, has culminated in his acquittal on account of the benefit of doubt, however while seeking reinstatement, such acquittal alone cannot be claimed to be an indubitable testament to the bona fide conduct of the petitioner," the Court observed.  The Court was therefore of the view that the petitioner was not entitled to the prayers made in the petition for setting aside the order of dismissal dated March 19, 2013 and reinstating him back in service.  "If such a relief is granted, it would have the effect of turning a blind eye towards the concern of the employer regarding the integrity, honesty and trustworthiness of the employee. Such a concern of the employer cannot be ignored merely because the petitioner was accorded the benefit of doubt in a criminal case, more so, in light of the judgments referred to above," the Court said.  Accordingly, the plea was dismissed.  Title: JAHAN SINGH v. TRIBAL COOPERATIVE MARKETING DEVELOPMENT FEDERATION OF INDIA LTD TRIFED AND ANR
