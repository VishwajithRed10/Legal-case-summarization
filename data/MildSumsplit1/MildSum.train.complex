1.       On 10th February 2020, for the reasons recorded, a Bench of two Hon’ble judges of this Court came to the conclusion that the view taken by this Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. Preetam Singh & Ors.1 (Preetam Singh’s case) needs reconsideration. Under Section 3 of the Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam, 1965 (for short ‘the 1965 Act’), Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad (for short ‘the Board’) was established. The basic object of the establishment of the Board was of framing and executing housing and improvement schemes in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The core issue on which the reference is made to a larger Bench is whether the act of determining service conditions of the employees and officers of the Board is one of the statutory functions of the Board. 2.       On 21st February 1995, the Board resolved to extend the pensionary benefits to its employees by replacing the existing Contributory Pension Scheme (for short ‘the old pension scheme’) with a pension/family pension/gratuity scheme (for short ‘the new pension scheme’). On 16th May 1996, the State Government accorded its consent to the new pension scheme subject to the condition that the Board will not be entitled to seek any financial assistance for the implementation of the new pension scheme. 3.       By a Resolution dated 5th November 1997, the Board approved the new pension scheme. The new pension scheme was based on the pension scheme of the State Government applicable to civil servants. On 26th November 1997, State Government passed an order staying the implementation of the new pension scheme. It appears that the State Government appointed a committee of experts to examine the new pension scheme of the Board. After considering the report of the committee of experts, the State Government vide order dated 14th September 1999 vacated the stay granted earlier by imposing a condition that the scheme shall be funded from the contribution to provident fund made by the Board and that neither the State Government nor the Board shall incur financial liability by implementing the new pension scheme. 4.     Preetam Singh and others who were the employees of the Board, filed a writ petition in Allahabad High Court. The prayer in the petition was initially confined to the challenge to the Government Order dated 14th September 1999. During the pendency of the said petition, on 7th May 2003, the State Government reiterated its earlier stand of granting no objection to the new pension scheme subject to the condition that no financial assistance shall be provided to the Board for implementing the said scheme. On 16th January 2004, the Board by an office order gave an option to its employees of either opting for the new pension scheme or continuing with the old pension scheme. In terms of the option given by the Board, according to the case of the State Government, 582 employees opted for the old pension scheme by filing necessary undertakings. On 13th September 2005, the State Government issued an order keeping its communication dated 7th May 2003 in abeyance on the ground that it was preparing comprehensive guidelines regarding the payment of pension to the employees of Public Sector Enterprises. By a communication dated 12th July 2007, the State Government purported to withdraw the approval granted earlier to the new pension scheme of the Board. The writ petition filed by Preetam Singh and others was amended and a challenge to the orders dated 13th September 2005 and 12th July 2007 was incorporated in the petition. During the pendency of the petition filed by Preetam Singh and others, the State Government issued an office memorandum dated 8th December 2008 for applying a revised pension, gratuity/family pension, and commutation scheme with effect from 1st January 2006 for the benefit of its employees. The said memorandum was issued in terms of the recommendations of the U.P Pay Committee, 2008. However, the employees of local bodies and public enterprises were specifically excluded from the applicability of the said office memorandum. Another office memorandum was issued on 8th December 2008 by the State Government for providing revised pensionary benefits to those Government servants who had retired before 1st January 2006. This order was made applicable to the employees of Public Sector Enterprises who were already getting pension prior to 1st January 2006. A Division Bench of Allahabad High Court by the judgment and order dated 16th January 2009 allowed the writ petition filed by Preetam Singh & others. The High Court quashed the orders dated 13th September 2005 and 12th July 2007 to the extent to which they related to the Board. A writ of mandamus was issued directing the Board to implement the new pension scheme in terms of its Regulations framed on 5th November 1997. 5.     In view of the decision of the High Court, a notification dated 19th May 2009 was issued by the Board in the exercise of powers under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act. The notification recorded that the Board had decided to implement the new pension scheme as admissible to the officers and employees of the State Government in terms of the Rules and Regulations set out in the said notification. The Board directed that the new pension scheme shall come into force and will apply to those officers who retired on or after 1st January 1996. However, it was stated that the Newly Defined Contributory Pension Rules of the State Government will be applicable to those employees of the Board who have joined the employment on or after 1st April 2005. The notification also provided that the orders issued from time to time by the State Government with respect to pension/ family pension/ gratuity shall be applicable to the officers and employees of the Board. 6.       The decision of the High Court was challenged by the State Government before this Court in which the decision of this Court in Preetam Singh’s case1 was rendered. It was observed in paragraph 21 of the final judgment of this Court that the interim order dated 7th August 2012 passed by this Court had the effect of staying the notification dated 19th May 2009. By the interim order of this Court dated 7th September 2012, the employees of the Board were permitted to claim benefits under the old pension scheme. However, it was observed that the interim order will not come in the way of the said employees agitating their claim and also supporting the relief granted by the High Court. 7.       One of the main contentions canvassed by the State of Uttar Pradesh before this Court in Preetam Singh’s case1 was based on provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the U.P. State Control Over Public Corporations Act, 1975 (for short ‘the 1975 Act’). Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act provides that every statutory body established or constituted under any Uttar Pradesh Act shall in the discharge of its functions be guided by such directions on questions of policies as may be issued to it by the State Government notwithstanding that no such power has been expressly conferred by the statute establishing such a statutory body on the State Government. The contention of the State Government was that the orders issued on 13th September 2005 and 12th July 2007 must be deemed to have been issued in the exercise of powers under Section 2(1) of the 1975 8.       While deciding Preetam Singh’s case1 on 24th September 2014, this Court referred to Section 15 of the 1965 Act which exhaustively incorporates the functions of the Board. This Court came to the conclusion that fixing conditions of service of its employees does not constitute a function of the Board. Therefore, this Court held that the State Government had no power to issue the directions contained in its orders dated 13th September 2005 and 12th July 2007. This Court also held that clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act vests a power in the Board to make Regulations for determining conditions of service of its officers and servants. It was held that the new pension scheme has been framed by the Board in the exercise of power under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95. While dismissing the Special Leave Petition filed by the State Government, this Court referred to the notification dated 19th May 2009 of the Board issued in the exercise of power under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act. This Court while dismissing the appeal preferred by the State Government directed that all the eligible employees of the Board will be governed by the said notification dated 19th May 2009. This Court directed the Board to release pensionary benefits to retired employees governed by the notification dated 19th May 2009 within a period of three months. Paragraph 21 of the decision containing the directions issued by this Court is reproduced below:- “21. It is also necessary for us to determine the consequence of the State of Uttar Pradesh, having approached this Court, to assail the impugned judgment dated 16-1-2009 [Preetam Singh v. State of U.P., 2009 SCC OnLine All 33 : (2009) 2 All LJ 702] . This Court having entertained the petition filed by the appellant, passed interim directions on 7-8-2012 [State of U.P. v. Preetam Singh, IA No. 7 in Civil Appeal No. 6307 of 2010, order dated 7-8-2012 (SC), wherein it was directed:“Taken on board. There shall be stay of the order passed in Writ Petition No. 1433 of 2011 dated 24-7-2012. IA No. 7 is disposed of. Registry is directed to list IA No. 4 on 27-82012, if it is in order.”] , which had the effect of staying the implementation of the directions issued by the High Court, namely, of staying the implementation of the Notification dated 19-5-2009. As a result, the employees governed by the Notification dated 19-5-2009, were paid their retiral dues under the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme. Since we have now affirmed the impugned judgment of the High Court, dated 16-12009 [Preetam Singh v. State of U.P., 2009 SCC OnLine All 33 : (2009) 2 All LJ 702] , it is apparent that all the eligible employees of the Vikas Parishad will be governed by the Notification dated 19-52009. They will therefore be entitled to the pensionary benefits from the date of their retirement. Undoubtedly, they have been denied the said retiral benefits, consequent upon the interim orders passed by this Court, at the behest of the State of Uttar Pradesh. In the above view of the matter, we direct the Vikas Parishad to release the pensionary benefits to the retired employees governed by the Notification dated 19-5-2009, within three months from today. While determining the pensionary benefits payable to the eligible retired employees up to date, if it is found that any of the retired employees is entitled to financial dues in excess of those already paid under the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, the said employee(s) will be paid interest on the said amount @ 9% p.a. The burden of the aforesaid interest component on the differential amount will be discharged by the Vikas Parishad in the first instance. The same shall, however, be recovered from the State of Uttar Pradesh, who is solely responsible for the interest ordered to be paid to the employees concerned.” 9.      On 16th October 2009, the State Government issued an order sanctioning revised pay structure, pay band, and grade pay to different categories of employees working in public enterprises/ corporations. The revised pay structure was incorporated in the annexure to the said order. The Government Order stated that necessary action shall be taken by the public enterprises/ corporations in consultation with the Public Enterprises Department/ Finance Department. It is also provided in the Government Order that the execution of the Government Order shall be made only after a proposal to that effect is approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Sector Enterprises. On 30th November 2009, the Housing Commissioner of the Board addressed a letter to the State Government for communicating the proposal of the Board to apply the revised pay structure to its employees. In response, on 14th January 2010, the State Government issued a communication permitting the Board to grant the revised pay structure according to the recommendations of the 7th Report of the U.P Pay Committee, 2008 to its employees. The State Government permitted the Board to grant the revised pay structure to its employees as provided in the aforesaid Government Order dated 16th October 2009. The said order was issued on the basis of the recommendations of the Empowered Committee. However, it was stated in that communication that the benefit shall be calculated on a notional basis with effect from 1st January 2006 in the pay band and grade pay as per the table annexed to the Government Order dated 16th October 2009. It provided that the actual benefit shall be provided with immediate effect i.e. from 14th January 2010. In short, the employees of the Board were not entitled to arrears of pay as per the revised pay structure with effect from 1st January 2006. They were entitled to revised pay scales only on a notional basis from 1st January 2006 and to the actual benefits only from 14th January 2010. Based on the said communication, an Office Order was issued by the Board on 23rd January 2010 for giving effect to the communication dated 14th January 2010. In fact, another Government Order was issued on 15th September 2011 stating that in terms of the order dated 14th January 2010, pay scales of the employees of the Board will be notionally revised with effect from 1st January 2006 but the actual benefits shall be extended only from 14th January 2010. The said Government Order reiterates that the employees of the Board will not be entitled to benefit of the revised pay structure for the period of 1st January 2006 to 13th January 2010. 10.     The State Government issued another order dated 05th May 2015 to the Board communicating the decision of the Hon’ble Governor to grant pensionary benefits to the employees of the Board in terms of the new pension scheme with retrospective effect from 1st January 2006. The decision of the State Government, inter alia, provided that the employees who were employed on or before 31st March 2005 and who had not retired till date shall be granted pension. It further provided that the employees who had already retired and had taken benefits under the old pension scheme will not be entitled to get a pension under the new pension scheme. The Government directed that the employees of the Board who have been employed on or after 1st April 2005 will not be entitled to grant of pension. In terms of the Government Order of 05th May 2015, the Board issued Office Order dated 13th May 2015. 11.      There were two sets of writ petitions filed before the Allahabad High Court. The first one was Writ Petition No.12645 of 2016 filed by certain employees of the Board. The following prayers were made in the petition : “(i) to issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Mandamus commanding the respondents to redetermine the salary of the petitioners till their retirement and thereafter their pensionary benefits on the basis of Sixth Pay Commission Recommendation w.e.f.1.1.2006. (ii)     to issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Mandamus commanding the respondents to apply the provisions of the Government Order No.1508 dated 8.12.2008 on the officers of the Parishad, while suitably reading down the restrictive provisions about its non-application on the employees of the U.P. Awas Evam Vikas Parishad in view of the Pension Regulations dated 19.5.2009 read with judgment and order of the Hon’ble Apex Court dated 23.9.2014. (iii)    to issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents to redetermine/re-fix the salary of the petitioners in terms of Sixth Pay Commission Recommendation w.e.f. 1.1.2006 till their retirement and thereafter redetermine their pensionary benefits as per revised last pay drawn and pay arrears of salary and revised pensionary benefits from the date of their retirement till date, in accordance with G.O. dated 8.12.2008, after deducting the amounts already paid towards pensionary benefits of the petitioners, within a period of 2 (iv)     to issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Mandamus commanding the respondents to grant the benefit of maximum gratuity of Rs.10 lac to the petitioners as per Government Order (v)      to issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Mandamus commanding the respondents to pay arrears of salary & pensionary benefits calculated in terms of the Sixth Pay Commission Recommendation, including enhanced gratuity of Rs.10 lac, along with payment of interest at the prevailing Bank rates, within a period of 2 months. (vi)     to issue an ad-interim mandamus to the respondent authorities to pay the current pension of the petitioners in terms of Sixth Pay Commission Recommendation.” Writ Petition No.10355 of 2017 was filed by another set of employees of the Board for challenging the order dated 05th May 2015 passed by the State Government and the consequential order dated 13th May 2015 passed by the Board. 12.      By the impugned judgment, the aforesaid two petitions were disposed of. While disposing of the petitions, in paragraph 41, the following directions were issued : “41. Accordingly, both the writ petitions are allowed and the impugned orders dated 05.05.2015 and 13.05.2015 contained in Annexure No.1 and 2 to the Writ Petition o.126345 (S/B) of 2017 are quashed to the extent they are contrary to the judgment passed by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. Preetam Singh and others : Civil Appeal No.6307 of 2010. A mandamus is issued to the respondents to grant benefit of arrears of salary payable to the employees of Parishad w.e.f. 1.1.2006 to 13.01.2010 and to fix their pension/ family pension and also release gratuity in accordance with the provisions of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Regulations notified on 19th May, 2009, and in the light of the orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.6307 of 2010 from the date of their entitlement alongwith interest @ 9% per annum within a period of two months from the date of production of certified copy of this order, failing which the petitioners shall be entitled and paid interest at the rate of 12% per annum.” 13.     Now, we come to the order dated 10th February 2020 passed by this Court. A Bench of two Hon’ble Judges of this Court prima facie found that the functions of the Board contemplated under Section 15 of the 1965 Act were wide enough even to cover the act of fixing service conditions of its employees. In paragraph 43, this Court framed three questions for consideration of a larger Bench. Paragraph 43 of the said order reads thus: “43. Due to the above reasons we are of the view that with regard to three aspects i.e. (1), (2) and (3) as 42 noted above, the judgment in Preetam Singh’s case needs reconsideration. We formulate following questions to be considered by a larger Bench: (1)     Whether the judgment of this Court inPreetam Singh’s case laying down that conditions of service of officers and employees do not constitute the functions of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad lays down the correct law more so when the judgment does not refer to provisions of Sections 8, 92, 94(2)(nn)of the 1965 Act ? (2)     Whether the view expressed in Preetam Singh’s judgment that functions of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad are only the specific functions enumerated in Section 15 of 1965 Act which does not include the service conditions of employees of the Board lays down the correct law ? Whereas the functions of the Board referred to in other provisions of Act, Rules and Regulations as has been expressly provided in Section 15(1) by use of expression “subject to the provisions of this Act and the Rules and Regulations” shall also be functions of the Board which induces service conditions of officers and employees as per Section 95(1)(f) of the 1965 Act. (3)     Whether the State Government had nojurisdiction to issue directions regarding service conditions of officers and employees of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad under the provisions of the 1965 Act and 1975 Act and all other enabling powers with the State Government? 14.     Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the State Government urged that the statutory functions of the Board include the function of fixing terms and conditions of the employment of its employees. She placed reliance on Section 92 of the 1965 Act which confers a power on the State Government to issue directions to the Board for carrying out the purposes of the 1965 Act. She urged that it is the duty of the Board to comply with the directions issued by the State Government. It was further submitted that apart from Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act, there was sufficient power vesting in the State Government under Section 8 of the Section 1965 Act to control and put restrictions on the powers of the Board to appoint officers and employees. The learned ASG invited our attention to the notification dated 19th May 2009 by which the Board applied the new pension scheme to the employees who retired on or after 1st January 1996. She pointed out that in the said notification, it is specifically directed that the orders with respect to pension/family pension/gratuity issued by the State Government from time to time shall also be applicable to the officers and employees of the Board. She pointed out that the said notification was never challenged. She would, therefore, submit that the directions of the State Government impugned by the private respondents cannot be faulted. After inviting our attention to the interim order dated 7th September 2012 passed by this Court, the learned ASG submitted that those who have unconditionally opted for the old pension scheme prior to 7th September 2012 have no subsisting right to claim the pension in terms of the new pension scheme. She submitted that the employees are not entitled to salary as per the revised pay structure for the period between 1st January 2006 to 13th January 2010 as per the binding directions of the State Government. The learned senior counsel representing the Board also made similar submissions. 15. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents in Civil Appeal Nos.6624 and 6625 of 2022 also made legal submissions. We may note here that while reserving the judgment on 15th September 2022, we had detagged the said appeals. Nevertheless, we are also considering the submissions made by the respondents in the detagged appeals as regards the three questions of law that are required to be decided. The submission of the learned counsel is that as several employees were facing financial hardships after their retirement, they had no option but to give the undertakings to accept the old pension scheme and not opt for the new pension scheme. Considering this situation, this Court by an interim order passed in Preetam Singh’s case1 had directed that even if employees have taken benefit of the old pension scheme by giving an undertaking, they will be entitled to the benefit of the new pension scheme in terms of the notification dated 19th May 2009. The learned counsel invited our attention to the subsequent order dated 5th May 2015 passed by the State Government by which the benefit of the new pension scheme was denied to those who opted to join the employment of the Board on or after 1st April 2005. His submission is that this direction is discriminatory which creates two classes of pensioners without any rational basis. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of D.S. Nakara & Ors. v. Union of India2 as well as another decision in the case of V. Sukumaran v. State of Kerala & Anr.3. He would, therefore, submit that reconsideration of the view taken in Preetam Singh’s case1 is not at all warranted. 16. Shri Nidhesh Gupta, the learned senior counsel stated that he represents only those respondents who had never opted for the old pension scheme and had not received any amount under the old scheme. He submitted that under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act, the Board has a power to make Regulations providing for conditions of service of officers and servants of the Board. Inviting our attention to sub-section (2) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act, Shri Gupta would submit that only when any Regulation framed by the Board is repugnant to the Rules framed by the State in the exercise of powers under Section 94, the Rules will prevail. He submitted that admittedly the State Government has not exercised the Rule making power under Section 94. He urged that under clause (nn) of sub-section (2) of Section 94, the State Government has a power to frame Rules concerning any matter for which Regulations can be framed under Section 95. He submitted that it is well settled that when an enactment requires that a certain thing should be done in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all. He relied upon various decisions in this behalf, viz., A.R. Antulay v. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak & Anr.4; Dhananjaya Reddy etc. v. State of Karnataka5; and Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Essar Power Ltd.6. 17. Inviting our attention to Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act, he submitted that the power conferred by the said provision on the State Government to issue directions is a general power. This power is confined to issuing directions on questions of policies. He submitted that the said power can be exercised in relation to the discharge of functions of the Board. He urged that Section 15 of Chapter III of the 1965 Act lays down the functions of the Board. He pointed out that Chapter III requires the Board to frame various schemes. He urged that none of the clauses (a) to (p) of Section 15 lays down that the appointment of employees and fixing their service conditions is a function of the Board under the 1965 Act. He urged that in the exercise of power under Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act, directions cannot be issued regarding the service conditions of officers and employees of the Board. 18.      By referring to Section 7 of the 1965 Act, he submitted that sub-section (2) thereof clearly provides that the conditions of service of the Housing Commissioner shall be such as may be prescribed. Relying upon the definition of the word ‘prescribed’ in clause (n) of Section 2, he submitted that the conditions of service of the Housing Commissioner have to be prescribed by the State Government by exercising the Rule making power. However, Section 8 which provides for the appointment of officers and servants of the Board does not contain such a provision. He submitted that the special or general orders of the State Government contemplated by sub-section (1) of Section 8 can be issued only regarding the mode and manner of appointment of the officers and servants of the Board and the same have nothing to do with service conditions. The power of the State Government to issue general or special orders is only for the purpose of imposing control and restrictions on the appointment of the officers and servants of the Board. Therefore, sub-section (1) of Section 8 cannot be construed to mean that by issuing general or special orders, the State Government can determine the conditions of service of the officers and servants of the Board. He submitted that as two different expressions have been used in Sections 7 and 8 of the 1965 Act, different meanings will have to be assigned to the said different expressions. On this issue, he relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust v. State of Haryana7. 19.      He urged that the power under sub-section (2) of Section 92 can be exercised by the State Government by issuing directions that are necessary for carrying out the purposes of the 1965 Act. He submitted that in any event, in the present case, statutory Regulations have been framed by the Board dealing with the grant of pensionary benefits. 20.      He submitted that the power to issue directions under Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act is a general power and the power under Sections 8 and 92 of the 1965 Act is a specific or special power. Relying upon a decision of this Court in the case of Commercial Tax Officer, Rajasthan v. Binani Cements Ltd. & Anr.8, he urged that the specific provisions under the 1965 Act will prevail over the general provision under Section 2(1) of the 1975 21.      He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Harwindra Kumar v. Chief Engineer, Karmik & Ors. 9 . He submitted that executive order cannot override the exercise of power made by the Board by framing Regulations concerning the new Pension Scheme. He submitted that if the submission of the State Government that by issuing executive orders it can override the provisions of the Regulations framed under Section 95 of the 1965 Act is accepted, the entire scheme of Sections 94 and 95 of the 1965 Act will be rendered completely redundant. Relying upon a decision of this Court in the case of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. Price Waterhouse & Anr.10, he would submit that such an interpretation cannot be accepted. 22.      He pointed out that if the pension is not granted on the basis of revised pay scales, the very purpose of the grant of pension will be defeated. He submitted that employees cannot be divided into two classes – one of those who retired pre-1996 and others of who retired post-1996. He submitted that there was no justification for the Bureau of Public Enterprises for writing a letter dated 14th January 2010 conferring the benefit of the revised pension not from 1st January 2006 but from 14th January 2010. He submitted that no explanation has been offered either before the High Court or this Court for fixing the date of 14th January 2010. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of State of Rajasthan & Anr. v. Prem Raj11. 23.      He pointed out that the benefit of the revised pension was given by the State Government to the employees of U.P Power Corporation with effect from 1st January 2006. To the employees of U.P Jal Nigam, the benefit of the revised pension was given only from 12th April 2010. The employees of Jal Nigam filed a writ petition before the High Court which was allowed by holding that the employees were entitled to get the benefit of the revised pension from 1st January 2006. The said decision has become final as a Special Leave Petition filed by the State Government against the said order has been dismissed on 20th May 2022. He submitted that the Board has adequate resources to bear the burden of payment of revised pension from 1st January 2006. His submission is that the law laid down by this Court in the case of Preetam Singh’s case1 does not call for any reconsideration at all. 24.      The three questions framed under Order dated 10th February 2020 are inter-connected. For deciding these three questions, we will have to decide the core issues whether the functions of the Board are confined to those which are set out in Section 15 of the 1965 Act and whether the appointment of officers and employees of the Board and the determination of their conditions of service constitute the functions of the Board. Another question that will have to be addressed is as regards the power, if any, of the State Government to issue directions to the Board concerning the determination of the conditions of service of its officers and servants. 25.      We have perused the provisions of the 1965 Act. Chapter II thereof has the heading, “Establishment and conduct of business of the Board”. Chapter II consists of Sections 3 to 14. Section 3 provides for the constitution of the Board. Section 7 provides for the appointment of a Housing Commissioner. Section 7 reads thus : (1)      There shall be a Housing Commissioner appointedby the State Government for the purposes of this Act. (2)      The conditions of service of the HousingCommissioner shall be such as may be prescribed. He shall be remunerated from the Board’s fund. (3)     The State Government may, if it is of opinion thatspecial circumstances so require, appoint the Housing Commissioner to be the Adhyaksh in addition to his own duties. (4)     The State Government may also appoint theHousing Commissioner as an authority under any other law for the time being in force.” Section 8 deals with “Appointment of Officers and Servants”. Section 8 reads thus : “8. Appointment of officers and servants.-(1) Subject to such control and restrictions as may from time to time be imposed by the State Government, by special or general orders, the Board may appoint such officers and servants as it considers necessary for the efficient performance of its functions. (2) the Board may, with the previous approval of the State Government appoint a servant of the Central or the State Government or of a local authority on any of the posts under it on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon.” As provided in sub-section (1) of Section 7, the Housing Commissioner has to be appointed by the State Government. Subsection (2) of Section 7 provides that the conditions of service of the Housing Commissioner must be prescribed by the Rules. Rule-making power under Section 94 vests with the State Government. Clause (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 94 empowers the State Government to frame Rules determining the conditions of service of the Housing Commissioner. The obvious reason for conferring the power to determine service conditions of the Housing Commissioner on the State Government appears to be that the State Government is the appointing authority. 26.     In contrast, sub-section (1) of Section 8 provides thatsubject to control and restrictions imposed from time to time by the State Government by special or general orders, the Board may appoint such officers and servants as it considers necessary for the efficient performance of its functions. There is a marked distinction between the language used by sub-section (2) of Section 7 and sub-section (1) of Section 8 though both provisions deal with the power to appoint officers of the Board. Thus, two different expressions or terminologies have been used in Sections 7 and 8. Therefore, the legislature intended to convey different meanings. Sub-section (1) of Section 8 does not provide that the State Government shall have the power to determine the conditions of service of officers and employees of the Board. The power to control the appointment and the power to put restrictions are distinct and different from the power to determine the service conditions of the officers and servants of the Board. The control of the State Government and the power to impose restrictions as provided in sub-section (1) of Section 8 will extend to the creation of posts of officers and servants of the Board. The control can be exercised by directing the creation of different categories of posts. The control can be also exercised by determining the number of posts of different categories. In this context, Sections 94 and 95 of the 1965 Act are also relevant. Under sub-section (1) of Section 94, the State Government retains the general Rule making power of framing Rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act. Without prejudice to the generality of the power under sub-section (1), subsection (2) of Section 95 lays down the topics and subjects on which Rule-making power can be exercised. One of the specific powers conferred by clause (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 94 on the State Government, as pointed out earlier, is of framing Rules for laying down conditions of service of the Housing Commissioner. Clause (nn) of sub-section (2) of Section 94 reads thus : (2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may (nn) any matter for which regulation may be made by the Board under Section 95; Thus, clause (nn) of sub-section (2) of Section 94 confers power on the State Government to frame Rules in respect of any matter for which regulations can be framed by the Board. Section 95 which confers the powers on the Board to frame Regulations reads thus : “95. Power to make regulations.-(1) The Board may, by notification in the Gazette, make (e)     the duties of officers and servants of the Board; (f)     the conditions of service of officers and servants of the Board; (n)     any other matter which is to be or may be provided for by regulations under this Act or the Clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 specifically empowers the Board to frame Regulations governing conditions of service of officers and servants of the Board. Under clause (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 94, the State Government has a power to determine the conditions of service of the Housing Commissioner. Thus, the Legislature has specifically incorporated in Section 7 that the State Government shall have the power to determine the conditions of service of the Housing Commissioner. However, such a provision is conspicuously absent in Section 8 dealing with the appointment of servants and officers of the Board. The reason is that the power to determine the service conditions of the other officers and servants has been conferred on the Board which can be exercised by making Regulations. 27.     In view of sub-section (2) of Section 95 read with clause (nn) of sub-section (2) of Section 94, Regulations, if any, framed by the Board for determining the conditions of services of its officers and servants are always subject to the Rules which may be framed by the State Government by exercising the power under clause (nn) of sub-section (1) of Section 94. Whenever there is any inconsistency between the Regulations framed under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 and the Rules framed under clause (nn) of subsection (1) of Section 94, the Rules will prevail and to that extent, the provisions of the Regulations which are repugnant to the Rules shall be void. To put it differently, the power to determine the conditions of service of the officers (except the Housing Commissioner) and servants of the Board vests in the Board, and the said power can be exercised only by framing Regulations under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95. So long as Rules are not framed by the State Government under clause (nn) of subsection (1) of Section 95 for overriding the provisions of the Regulations framed by the Board for prescribing the service conditions, the provisions of Regulations shall always govern the field. Except for the exercise of the Rule making power under clause (nn) of sub-section (1) of Section 94, there is no specific power conferred under the 1965 Act, or for that matter under the 1975 Act, on the State Government to nullify or to override the conditions of service of its officers and servants determined by the Board by the Regulations framed in the exercise of powers under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95. 28.    Now coming to the issue of the functions of the Board, we may note that Chapter III of the 1965 Act has the heading “Functions and Powers of the Board”. As noted earlier, specific provisions regarding the appointment of the Housing Commissioner, officers and servants of the Board find a place in Chapter II and not in Chapter III. As specifically provided in clause (1) of Section 8, the Board is empowered to appoint such officers and servants as it considers necessary for the efficient performance of its functions. This is one factor that suggests that the appointment of officers and servants is not a function of the Board but their appointments are required to be made for the efficient performance of its functions. 29.    Chapter III dealing with “Functions and Powers of the Board” comprises of Sections 15 to 49. Section 15 has the heading “Functions of the Board” which reads thus : “15. Functions of the Board.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations, the functions of the Board shall be- (a)    to frame and execute housing and improvement schemes and other projects; (b)    to plan and co-ordinate various housing activities in the State and to ensure expeditious and efficient implementation of housing and improvement schemes in the State; (c)    to provide technical advice for and scrutinise various projects under housing and improvement schemes sponsored or assisted by Central Government or the State Government; (d)    to assume management of such immovable properties belonging to the State Government as may be transferred or entrusted to it for this purpose; (e)    to maintain, use, allot, lease, or otherwise transfer plots, buildings and other properties of the Board or of the State Government placed under the control and management of the Board; (f)    to organise and run workshops and stores for the manufacture and stock-piling of building (g)    on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Board and the State Government, to declare houses constructed by it in execution of any scheme to be houses subject to the U.P. Industrial Housing Act, 1955 (U.P. Act No.XXIII of 1955); (h)    to regulate building operations; (j)     to provide roads, electricity, sanitation, watersupply and other civic amenities and essential services in areas developed by it; (k)     to acquire movable and immovable properties for any of the purposes before mentioned; (l)     to raise loans from the market, to obtain grants and loans from the State Government, the Central Government, local authorities and other public corporations, and to give grants and loans to local authorities, other public corporations, housing co-operative societies and other persons for any of the purposes before mentioned; (m)     to make investigation, examination or survey of any property or contribute towards the cost of any such investigation, examination or survey made by any local authority or the State (o)     to fulfil any other obligation imposed by or under this Act or any other law for the time being (p)     to do all such other acts and things as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions before mentioned. (2) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations, Board may undertake, where it deems necessary, any of the following functions, namely- (a)     to promote research for the purpose of expediting the construction of and reducing the cost (b)     to execute works in the State on behalf of public institutions local authorities and other public corporations, and departments of the Central Government and the State Government; (c)     to supply and sell building materials; (d)     to co-ordinate, simplify and standardise the production of building materials and to encourage and organise the prefabrication and mass production of structural components; (e)     with a view to facilitating the movement of the population in and around any city, municipality, town area or notified area to establish, maintain and operate any transport service; to construct, widen strengthen or otherwise improve roads and bridges and to give financial help (f)     to do all such other acts and things as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions before mentioned.” As the appointments of officers and servants of the Board are dealt with by Sections 7 and 8 in Chapter II, the same do not find a place in the functions of the Board set out either in Section 15 or in any other Section in Chapter III. There are provisions incorporated in Chapter III dealing with various schemes and the powers of the Board which can be exercised for the implementing the schemes. 30.     Chapter V of the 1965 Act provides for the Board of acquiring and disposing of land for the purposes of the Act. Under Section 59, the Board is empowered to issue debentures. Under Section 58(3), the Board is entitled to raise loans for the purposes of the Act. Obviously, acquiring and selling the property, issuing debentures, and raising loans cannot be the functions of the Board. These powers have been conferred by Chapter V to enable the Board to effectively discharge its functions and to exercise its powers specified in Chapter III. The nature of the functions of a statutory body like the Board will always depend on the object of establishing such a body. The appointment of officers and servants needs to be made for the efficient performance of the specific functions of the Board. The exercise of power to appoint servants and officers of the Board and determination of their service conditions cannot constitute the functions of the Board. The powers under Chapter V and the power of appointing officers and servants under Sections 7 and 8 of Chapter II need to be exercised for ensuring proper discharge of the functions of the Board as well as for the exercise of the powers set out in Chapter III. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the appointment of officers and servants and determination of their service conditions cannot constitute functions of the Board. 31.     Section 92 which provides for Control of the State Government over the Board is a part of Chapter X under the heading “External Control”. Section 92 reads thus : “92. Control of the State Government over the Board and other local authorities.-(1) The (a)     submit to the State Government such reports and returns in such forms and at such intervals as may be prescribed; (b)     furnish to the State Government such documents, returns, statements, estimates or other information regarding any matter under the control of the Board as may be directed by the State (2)     The State Government may give the Board such directions as in its opinion are necessary or expedient for carrying out the purposes of this Act, and it shall thereupon be the duty of the Board to comply with such directions. (3)     Without prejudice to other provisions of this Act,and notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the State Government may give any local authority such directions as in its opinion are necessary or expedient for enabling the Board to carry out the purposes of this Act; and thereupon it shall be the duty of the local authority to comply with such The power under sub-section (2) of section 92 is to be exercised for issuing directions for carrying out the purposes of the 1965 Act. The issue is whether the State Government can exercise the power under sub-section (2) of Section 92 to override statutory Regulations framed by the Board in the exercise of powers under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95. If the State Government desires to override or nullify such Regulations, there is a specific provision under the said Act of 1965 which enables the State Government to do so. On a conjoint reading of clause (nn) of subsection (1) of Section 94 and sub-section (2) of Section 95, the State Government has the power to frame Rules determining the service conditions of the officers and servants of the Board and once the Rules are framed by the State Government in this behalf, the provisions of the Regulations framed by the Board will apply only to the extent to which they are not repugnant to the Rules. Service conditions will necessarily include salary, perquisites, allowances, retirement benefits such as pension, etc. The Regulations framed by the Board under clause (f) of sub-section (2) of Section 95 have a force of law. On a plain reading of subsection (2) of Section 92, by no stretch of the imagination, by issuing directions, the State Government can nullify the statutory Regulations framed under Section 95. More so, when the 1965 Act itself specifically enables the State Government to nullify the Regulations by exercising the Rule making power. As the scheme of the 1965 Act specifically provides that Regulations framed under Section 94 can be overridden by framing Rules in accordance with clause (nn) of sub-section (1) of Section 94, the act of overriding the Regulations must be done only by framing the Rules and not in any other manner. This view is supported by a series of decisions of this Court taking a consistent view that where an enactment requires to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way and in no other manner. There are several decisions taking that view ending with the decision of this Court in the case of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam6. However, the locus classicus on this point is the well-known decision of the Privy Council in the case of Nazir Ahmed v. The King Emperor12. It was held by Privy Council that “where a power is given to do certain things in a certain way, the things must be done in that way and not at all. Other methods of performance are certainly forbidden”. The upshot of the aforesaid discussion is that the State Government has no power to issue directions under sub-section (2) of Section 92 to nullify or override the Regulations framed by the Board in the exercise of powers under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95. 32.      Another argument of the State Government is based on subsection (1) of Section 15 which opens with an expression “subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations”. By use of the said expression, the exercise of the power to frame Regulations for determining the conditions of service of officers and servants does not become a function of the Board. The meaning of the opening part of sub-section (1) of Section 15 is that the functions of the Board must be discharged subject to the constraints of the Rules and Regulations framed under the 1965 Act. 33.      Next limb of the argument of the State Government is based on Section 2(1) of 1975 "2. (1) Power to issue directions to statutory bodies.-Every statutory body (by whatever name called), established or constituted under any Uttar Pradesh Act, excepting Universities governed by the Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973, as reenacted and amended by the Uttar Pradesh University (re-enactment and Amendment Act), 1974, shall, in the discharge of its functions, be guided by such directions on questions of policies, as may be given to it by the State Government, notwithstanding that no such power has expressly been conferred on the State Government under the law establishing or constituting such statutory body." On a plain reading of the aforesaid provision, the power to issue directions vested in the State Government can be exercised only for issuing directions confined to questions of policies. The directions can be issued confined to policies concerning the discharge of the functions of the Statutory Body. The directions issued by the State Government on the questions of policies guide every statutory body in the discharge of its functions. For the reasons we have already recorded while dealing with sub-section (2) of Section 92 of the 1965 Act, even the power under Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act cannot be invoked to nullify the statutory Regulations framed by the Board which have a force of law. That can be done only by exercising the Rule making power under clause (nn) of sub-section (1) of Section 94 of the 1965 Act. The power under Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act is the general power that must yield to the special powers conferred by the 1965 Act. The power under sub-section (1) of Section 2 is different and distinct from the power to frame statutory 34. The aforesaid discussion is sufficient to answer the three questions framed. Subject to what we have held above, we concur with the view taken by this Court in Preetam Singh’s case1. Our answers to the three questions are as under : Q.1 Whether the judgment of this Court in Preetam Singh’s case laying down that conditions of service of officers and employees do not constitute the functions of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad lays down the correct law more so when the judgment does not refer to provisions of Sections 8, 92, 94(2)(nn)of the 1965 Act ? A: The decision lays down the correct proposition of law. Q.2 Whether the view expressed in Preetam Singh’s judgment that functions of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad are only the specific functions enumerated in Section 15 of 1965 Act which does not include the service conditions of employees of the Board lays down the correct law ? Whereas the functions of the Board referred to in other provisions of Act, Rules and Regulations as has been expressly provided in Section 15(1) by use of the expression “subject to the provisions of this Act and the Rules and Regulations” shall also be functions of the Board which induces service conditions of officers and employees as per Section 95(1)(f) of the A: The first part of the question is answered in the affirmative. The functions of the Board are as specified in Section 15 and other relevant sections in Chapter III of the 1965 Act. The second part is answered in the negative. Q.3 Whether the State Government had no jurisdiction to issue directions regarding service conditions of officers and employees of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad under the provisions of the 1965 Act and 1975 Act and all other enabling powers with the State A: Answered in affirmative. But the State Government can always frame Rules in the exercise of powers under clause (nn) of sub-section (1) of Section 94 of the 1965 Act for determining the conditions of service of the servants and officers of the Board. Whenever there is any inconsistency between Regulations framed under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 and the Rules framed under clause (nn) of sub-section (1) of Section 94, the Rules will prevail and to that extent, the provisions of the Regulations which are repugnant to the Rules shall be void. 35.    After having decided the questions, we are of the view that Civil Appeals can be decided in terms of our findings instead of sending them back to the Bench of two Hon’ble 36.    Now, we proceed to deal with the ancillary issues. Now coming to the new pension scheme, an Office Order was issued on 16th January 2004 by the Board recording that a proposal for framing a scheme of pension was under consideration. The Office Order dated 16th January 2004 provided that those employees who were not interested in opting for the new pension scheme must file an affidavit on stamp paper of Rs.10/-. In the said affidavit, it must be clearly and specifically asserted that the beneficiary was not interested in the new pension scheme and the entire amount deposited by him as his share along with Board’s share should be paid to the beneficiary. It was also provided that the affidavit must state that in the future, the beneficiary will not claim pensionary benefits before any authority or the Court. According to the stand taken by the State Government, total of 582 employees/officers opted for the old scheme by filing affidavits/undertakings. The State Government has placed on record a copy of the affidavit of respondent no.1 – Virendra Kumar in one of the appeals. It is not disputed that all the affidavits of the employees who decided not to opt for the new pension scheme are in the same format. In the affidavit, it was incorporated that the employee was not interested at all in the pension scheme and he was interested in taking payments under the old scheme. It is specifically stated that he will not make any claim in respect of the new pension scheme. 37.    After the State Government accorded its approval, on 05th November 1997 the Board passed a Resolution approving the new pension Scheme. The High Court while allowing the petitions filed by Preetam Singh and others, directed the Board to implement the new pension scheme in terms of its decision dated 05th November 1997. High Court allowed the petition on 16th January 2009. For giving effect to the decision, on 19th May 2009, the Board issued a notification recording that in the exercise of the powers under clauses (f) and (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act, it has decided that the pension scheme and gratuity admissible to the officers and servants of the State Government shall be admissible to the employees of the Board. The relevant part of the Now therefore, the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad, in exercise of the power under clause (f)(i) & (n) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam, 1965 (U.P. Act 1 of 1966) has decided that the Pension/Family Pension and Gratuity admissible to the officers and employees of State Government, which is governed by the following rules, schemes and Government orders shall also be admissible (excluding Pension commutation) to the officer and employees of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad : 5.     All orders of finance department of U.P. Government as related to pension / family 6.     Newly defined Contributory Pension rules According to notification no.Sa-3-379/ Das-2005-301(9)/2003, dated March 28, 2005 applicable to officers and employees of State Govt., who joined services on April 01, 2005 on onwards      do The orders with respect to the Pension/Family Pension/Gratuity issued time to time by the State Govt. shall also be applicable to the officers and employees of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas It has also been decided by the Parishad that General Provident Funds Rules, 1985, shall be applicable to the officer and employees of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad instead of Contributory In GPF Rules and Govt. Rules/Orders issued in this regard, ‘Govt.’ means the ‘U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad’, ‘Accountant General’ means ‘finance Controller of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad’ & ‘Head of Department’ means ‘Housing Commissioner’. The State Government shall not provide any financial assistance for the implementation of the Contents of the notification shall come into force w.e.f. January 1, 1996 and such officers and employees of Avas Evam Vikas Parishad who have retired on or after the said date shall be benefited with the said decision. Newly defined Contributory Pension Rules notified by the State Government shall be applicable to those employees who have joined Parishad services on April 01, 2005 or Thus, the new pension scheme was retrospectively brought into force from 1st January 1996 and was made applicable to the employees and officers of the Board who retired on or after that date. It is also recorded therein that the newly defined Contributory Pension Rules notified by the State Government shall be applicable to those employees of the Board who have joined the employment from 1st April 2005 onwards. Thus, the applicability of the new pension scheme was confined to the officers and employees who retired on or after 1st January 1996. The officers and employees appointed on or after 1st April 2005 were excluded from the applicability of the new pension scheme. We must note here that the notification dated 19th May 2009 has become final and in none of the petitions which are the subject matter of these appeals, the same was challenged. In fact, in Writ Petition No.10355 of 2017, there was a prayer to issue a mandamus to implement the notification. Moreover, in paragraph 21 of the decision of this Court in Preetam Singh’s case1, this Court issued a mandate to act upon the said notification. The notification dated 19th May 2009 specifically states that the orders with respect to the pension/ family pension/ gratuity issued from time to time by the State Government shall be applicable to the officers and servants of the Board. Thus, only those employees of the Board who have retired on or after 1st January 2006 will be entitled to the benefit of the new pension scheme and those who are appointed on or after 1st April 2005 will be governed by another set of Rules as mentioned in the notification dated 19th May 2009. 38.    In the Special Leave Petition filed by the State Government against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Preetam Singh and others, an interim order was passed by this Court on 7th August 2012 which had the effect of staying the judgment of the High Court and the notification dated 19th May 2009. The further interim order dated 7th September 2012 recorded that if the employees of the Board, who have retired from service, claim Contributory Provident Fund and other retiral benefits (as per the old scheme), the Board shall pass appropriate orders granting the benefit under the old scheme. However, it was clarified that the said interim order will not come in the way of the respondents before this Court agitating their claim and supporting the reliefs granted by the Allahabad High Court. Paragraph 21 of the judgment records that by the interim order, the notification dated 19th May 2009 was stayed, and therefore, no one could get pension under the new scheme. Therefore, the interim order was passed which enabled the employees who had not received benefits either under the old scheme or the new pension scheme, to take benefits under the old scheme. This interim order was made as no one could get the benefit of the old scheme as a result of the stay granted to the notification dated 19th May 2009. The interim order dated 7th September was thus applicable only to those employees who had not taken benefits under the old scheme till 7th September 2012. Obviously, those officers and employees of the Board who opted for the old scheme by filing affidavits in terms of the Office Order dated 16th January 2004 and received the benefits under the old scheme before the interim order dated 07th September 2012 was passed, are disentitled to claim pension under the new pension scheme. Those officers and employees of the Board who opted to take benefits under the old scheme after 07th September 2012 will be entitled to benefit of the direction issued by this Court in paragraph 21 of the decision in Preetam Singh’s case1 regarding the payment of pension under the new pension scheme and the payment of interest on the differential amount. 39.     The State Government issued two Office Memoranda on 08th December 2008. The first was regarding the revision of pension/ gratuity/ family pension and commutation with effect from 1st January 2006 on the basis of recommendations of the U.P. Pay Committee, 2008. The said order specifically recorded that it will not apply to local bodies and public enterprises. The second Office Memorandum dated 08th December 2008 was issued for applying revision of pension and family pension in respect of the employees who have retired prior to 1st January 2006. Obviously, the second Office Memorandum is not relevant as the new pension scheme of the Board was made applicable to those who retired on or after 1st January 2006 as provided in the notification dated 19th May 2009. The first Office Memorandum dated 08th December 2008 which excluded the officers and employees of the Board was challenged belatedly for the first time in 2016 in Writ Petition No.126445 of 2016. We may note here that the Board’s notification dated 19th May 2009 was issued in the exercise of Regulation making power under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act which provided that orders issued by the State Government from time to time with respect to pension/ family pension/ gratuity shall be applicable to the officers and employees of the Board. No part of the regulations framed by the Board on 19th May 2009 was ever challenged. Therefore, the officers and employees of the Board who were the beneficiaries under the notification dated 19th May 2009 were bound by the first Memorandum dated 08th December 2008 and the orders passed from time to time by the State Government with regard to pension and family pension. Moreover, revised pension was granted to the State Government employees as the recommendations of U.P Pay Committee, 2008 were made applicable to them. The said recommendations were applied to the employees of the Board on 14th January 2010. We may note here that the Allahabad High Court, by the impugned judgment, has not set aside or modified the Office Memorandum dated 08th December 2008. 40.     On 16th October 2009, the State Government issued an order making applicable revised pay structure in terms of the report of the 7th U.P. Pay Committee, 2008 to the public enterprises and corporations subject to the terms and conditions incorporated therein. The Board, by a letter dated 30th November 2009, informed the State Government of its decision to apply the revised pay structure. It was sought to be argued by some of the respondents that the order dated 14th January 2010 relates to pension. In fact, it only deals with the applicability of the revised pay structure to the employees and officers of the Board. By the order dated 14th January 2010, the State Government communicated its decision to allow the Board to apply the revised pay structure on a notional basis with effect from 1st January 2006 in the pay band and grade pay in the revised pay structure as per the table enclosed to the Government Order dated 16th October 2009. The said order recorded that the benefit of pay structure shall be granted with immediate effect to the officers and employees of the Board by calculating the benefit on a notional basis with effect from 1st January 2006. The Office Order was issued by the Board on 23rd January 2010 for implementation of the aforesaid order dated 14th January 2010. The meaning of the order dated 16th January 2010 was that the actual benefit of the revised pay structure will be available immediately from that date by calculating the pay on a notional basis in terms of the revised pay structure with effect from 1st January 2006. In other words, the order dated 14th January 2010 made it clear that the officers and employees of the Board will not be entitled to revised pay from 1st January 2006 till 14th January 2010 and that they will get the benefit of revised pay only from 14th January 2010. But, while calculating the revised pay with effect from 14th January 2010, the benefit of the revised pay structure was to be notionally provided from 1st January 2006. Thus, the pay fixation as of 14th January 2010 must be made by notionally granting the benefit of the new pay structure with effect from 1st January 2006. The communication dated 15th January 2011 of the State Government addressed to the Housing Commissioner of the Board records that the officers and employees of the Board will not be entitled to arrears of revised pay for the period from 1st January 2006 to 13th January 2010. None of these orders of 16th October 2009, 14th January 2010, and 15th January 2011 were concerning pension. These orders deal only with the grant of a revised pay structure. But, the computation of pension has to be made on the basis of the applicable pay structure. Hence, those who retired on or after 1st January 2006 and those who were entitled to benefit of the new pension scheme under the notification dated 19th May 2009 will be benefitted from the revised pay structure to the extent that their pension will have to be calculated on the basis of revision of pay structure on notional basis from 1st January 2006. 41.    On 05th May 2015, the State Government issued another order regarding pensionary benefits to the officers and employees of the Board in terms of which Office Order dated 13th May 2015 was issued. The gist of the said order dated 05th May 2015 is (i)    Such staff of U.P. Avas and Vikas Parishad whose recruitment was done on or before 31 March 2005 and who have not retired till date, will be entitled to pension; (ii)   Such staff of U.P. Avas and Vikas Parishad who had retired and had taken all the benefits under the C.P.F. Scheme after getting retired, will not be entitled to pension; (iii)  Such staff of U.P. State Avas and Vikas Parishad whose recruitment was done on or after 1st April 2005 will not be entitled get the pension; and (iv)   In the light of the order of this Court in Preetam Singh’s case, the 9% interest is not payable to any retired staff in C.P.F. Scheme. In future, if the question of paying interest to any staff member arises, then the Board will bear the said expense by itself and no claim can be made from the government. The directions in the above terms were incorporated in the consequential order issued by the Board on 13th May 2015. Notification dated 19th May 2009 issued by the Board clearly provides that all the officers and employees who retired on or after 1st January 2006 will be entitled to benefit of the new pension scheme but those who were employed on or after 1st April 2005 will be entitled to benefits under the newly defined Contributory Pension Rules of the State Government. To that extent, clause (i) of the Government Order dated 5th May 2015 will require modification. Even clause (ii) will require clarification in terms of this Judgment. Those officers and employees who have already taken benefit of the old scheme before 07th September 2012 by giving undertakings will not get the benefit of the new pension scheme but those who have taken the benefit of the old scheme after the date of the interim order dated 7th September 2012 will be entitled to take benefit of the new pension scheme. Clause (iii) of the order means that in view of the notification dated 19th May 2009, those who are appointed on or after 1st April 2005 will not get the benefit of the new pension scheme under the said notification. As regards clause (iv), interest will be payable in terms of the decision of this Court in Preetam Singh’s case1, only to those employees and officers who had not taken benefit of the old scheme before the interim order dated 07th September 2012 was passed by this Court. Interest in terms of the decision of this Court will be payable on differential amounts, to those who have taken benefits under the old scheme after 07th September 2012. To the above extent, the directions of this Court issued in Preetam Singh’s case1 will have to be clarified. 42.      Now, the other issue which survives is whether the officersand employees are entitled to arrears of pay as per the revised pay structure for the period between 1st January 2006 to 13th January 2010. The impugned judgment proceeds on the footing that the order of the State Government directing that the officers and employees of the Board will get the benefit of the new pay structure notionally from 1st January 2006 and actually from 14th January 2010 is issued in the exercise of power under Section 2(1) of 1975 Act and Section 92(2) of the 1965 Act. Therefore, the High Court held that the State Government could not have issued the said direction regarding the determination of conditions of service as the determination of the conditions of service was not a function of the Board. 43.      As far as the applicability of the pay structure to the employees and officers of the Board is concerned, there is no material placed on record to show that the Regulation making power under Section 95 was at all exercised by the Board regarding applying revised pay structure applicable to the State Government employees to its own employees. All that the Board did was to implement the order of the State Government dated 14th January 2010 by granting a revised pay structure to its employees. The said order is based on the order of the State Government issued on 16th October 2009 by which a decision was taken to apply the revised pay structure applicable to the State Government employees to the employees of public sector enterprises on the terms and conditions incorporated therein. As noted earlier, by exercising the Rule making power under clause (nn) of sub-section 2 of Section 94 of the 1965 Act, the State Government could have always determined the pay scales of the officers and employees of the Board. If it is held that the State Government had no power to issue the orders dated 16th October 2009 and 14th January 2010, the employees of the Board will not get the benefit of the revised pay structure made applicable to the Government employees as the Board has not framed the Regulations under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 of the 1965 Act providing for the grant of revised pay structure to the employees. Surprisingly, in paragraph 22 of the impugned judgment, the High Court has held that the orders dated 16th October 2009 and 14th January 2010 would have no applicability in the matter of laying down the conditions of service of the employees of the Board. If this finding is upheld, the employees of the Board will be completely deprived of the benefit of the revised pay structure as there is no Regulation made by the Board operating in the field. Hence, the employees of the Board will be entitled to the revised pay structure in terms of the said orders as clarified by the further order dated 15th September 2011. 44.      The grant of arrears from 1st January 2006 till 14th January 2010 will involve huge financial implications for the Board. Financial constraint is a valid ground for denying arrears as per the revised pay structure. The decision to provide the benefit of a higher pay structure to the officers and employees of the Board was taken by the State Government subject to the condition of not paying arrears for the period between 1st January 2006 and 14th January 2010. Therefore, we cannot approve the direction issued by the High Court under the impugned judgment to pay arrears of wages as per the new pay structure for the period from 1st January 2006 to 14th January 2010. 45.      Hence, our conclusions are as under : (i)      We uphold the decision of this Court in Preetam Singh’s case1 with a modification that the State Government can always exercise the powers under clause (nn) of sub-section (1) Section 94 of the 1965 Act for determining the conditions of service of the officers (other than the Housing Commissioner) and employees of the Board. If such power is exercised, those provisions of the Regulations framed under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 95 which are repugnant to the Rules, shall be void; (ii)     All the officers and employees of the Board who have not received the benefit of the old scheme till 07th September 2012 and have retired on or after 1st January 2006 shall be entitled to benefit of the new pension scheme as per the notification dated 19th May 2009 issued by the Board provided they are otherwise eligible. However, the officers and employees appointed on or after 1st April 2005 will be governed by the newly defined Contributory Pension Rules notified by the State Government; (iii)    Those officers and employees of the Board who have retired on or after 1st January 2006 and who have not received benefits under the old scheme till date shall be entitled to interest as directed by this Court in paragraph 21 of the decision in Preetam Singh’s case1. Even those officers and employees who are entitled to benefit of the new pension scheme in terms of the notification dated 19th May 2009 and who have taken benefits under the old scheme pursuant to the interim order dated 07th September 2012, will be entitled to interest on differential amounts, as directed in terms of paragraph 21 of the decision of this Court in Preetam Singh’s case1; (iv)     Those officers and employees of the Board who have accepted the benefit under the old scheme before 7th September 2012 after giving an undertaking in terms of the Office Order dated 16th January 2004 shall not be entitled to the benefit of the new pension scheme made applicable as per the notification dated 19th May 2009; (v)      While calculating the pension amount payable to those who are entitled to the new pension scheme in terms of the notification dated 19th May 2009, the benefit of notional pay fixation in terms of the revised pay structure with effect from 1st January 2006 shall be (vi)     All the officers and employees of the Board who are entitled to benefit of the revised pay structure in terms of the Government Order dated 14th January 2010 shall be provided the said benefit within a period of three months from today, if not provided earlier. While extending the said benefit, their pay shall be notionally determined as per the revised pay structure with effect from 1st January 2006. However, they shall not be entitled to arrears of salary as per the revised pay structure from 1st January 2006 till 14th January 2010. However, in the cases of the employees and officers who have already received the arrears, no recovery proceedings shall be initiated against them. 46.      The impugned judgment and order stands modified in terms of the above conclusions. The civil appeals are disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
1]                Being    aggrieved    and     dissatisfied       by     the judgment and award passed by the Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation and Judge, Labour Court, Latur in WCA No.33/2003, the appellants – original claimants preferred this Appeal for enhancement of amount of compensation. Brief facts of the case are as under: 2]                On 31st January, 2003, when the deceased Parmeshwar was driving the vehicle at about 6.00 a.m., at the relevant time the truck coming from the opposite direction gave dash to the truck driven by the deceased Parmeshwar. Due to said accident, he died on the spot. 3]                As the accident was occurred during the course of employment, hence, the claimants filed petition for claiming the compensation before the Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation and Judge, Labour Court, Latur [for short ‘the trial Court’]. Considering the evidence on record and after hearing the parties, learned trial Court has awarded the compensation. Against the said judgment and order, this appeal. 4]                It is the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants that the trial Court has not properly considered the income of the deceased. The deceased was driver. The trial Court has considered the income of the deceased of Rs.2,000/- per month. In the evidence, it has come on record that the deceased was getting salary of Rs.4,000/- per month but this fact was not considered by the trial Court. The trial Court has awarded 9% interest on the compensation amount from the date of accident. It should be 12% interest, hence, requested to allow the appeal. 5]                It is the contention of the learned counsel for respondent no.2 that the trial Court has passed the judgment and order on the basis of evidence led before the trial Court, the trial Court has considered all the aspects. No evidence was produced before the trial Court to prove that the deceased was getting Rs.4,000/- per month as salary. The interest awarded by the trial Court is proper, hence, the judgment passed by the trial Court is legal and valid. 6]                I have heard both learned counsel. Perused the judgment and order passed by the trial Court. The issue involved in this appeal is in respect of the income of the deceased was not properly considered by the trial Court and rate of interest should be 12%. Appellant no.1, who is a widow of the deceased, has examined herself before the Court and deposed that the deceased was getting Rs.4,000/- per month towards wages along with separate Bhatta. In cross examination, she admits that there is no salary certificate in respect of salary of her husband. The trial Court has observed that appellant no.1 had not filed any document to show that salary of the deceased was Rs.4,000/- per month. Her evidence is hearsay, hence, the trial Court has considered the salary of deceased Rs.2,000/- per month. In my view, admittedly, the deceased was driver of the truck vehicle so no question of salary certificate arise as he was private employee of truck owner. Generally, the wife knows salary of the husband. It has come in the evidence of appellant no.1 that her husband was getting Rs.4,000/- per month including Bhatta; it does not mean that she was speaking false. The trial Court should have considered this fact. The trial Court has considered lesser amount of Rs.2,000/- per month as salary of the deceased. Appellant no.1 has stated that Rs.4000/- salary was including Bhatta. Hence, I am considering salary of the deceased as Rs.3,000/- per month. ii]               The issue in respect of interest awarded by the trial Court, in my view, Section 4-A of the Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923 is compensation to be paid when due and penalty for default. Sub-section (3) (a) of the Employees’ Compensation Act reads as under : (3) Where any employer is in default in paying the compensation due under this Act within one month from the date it fell due, the Commissioner shall, - (a) direct that the employer shall, in addition to the amount of the arrears, pay simple interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent per annum or at such higher rate not exceeding the maximum of the lending rates of any scheduled bank as may be specified by the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, on the 7]                This section specifically states that rate of interest shall be Rs.12% but the trial Court has erred while awarding the interest of Rs.9%, hence, I am considering the rate of interest of 12%. 8]                Considering the above, the appellants are entitled for following amount as compensation:- Monthly wages : Rs.3000/- There is no dispute of multiplying factor, hence, 211.79 x 1500 = Rs.3,17,685 + 12% interest. The appellants are entitled for this amount. The Tribunal has granted Rs.2,11,790/- + 9% interest. 9]                In view of the above, I pass the following i]                Appeal is allowed. The appellants are entitled for enhanced amount of Rs.1,05,895/- @ Rs.12% interest. The appellants are entitled to get 12% interest on the amount of Rs.2,11,790/- from the date of filing of the application till its realization. ii]               Accordingly, Appeal is disposed of. Iii]              The appellants are permitted to withdraw the amount.
1.       The petitioners in all these petitions are the Overseas Citizens of India card holders. They are all students who have just reached the full age or are below this age. All the petitioners are aspiring to become Doctors by pursuing the MBBS course by securing admission through NEET selection process and thereafter the post- graduation as also the super specialty in the field of medicine. Some of them are also seeking to pursue post-graduation and also a super specialty. For the purpose of narration of facts, the averments as put forth in W.P.(C) No.891 of 2021 which was taken as the lead case is noted. The petitioners contend that they have been putting in all efforts and were preparing to appear for the NEET-UG examinations based on the right which was available to them under the notifications dated 11.04.2005 and 05.01.2009 . Through the said notifications, the Overseas Citizens of India (‘OCI’ for short) cardholders were given the right of parity with Non-Resident Indians (‘NRIs’ for short) in respect of the facilities as notified, including in the field of education, who in turn had the parity with Indian Citizens. Through the notification dated 05.01.2009, the said right to education in India was also extended further, to appear for the All India Pre-Medical Test or such other tests to make them eligible for admission in pursuance to the provisions contained in the relevant acts. In view of such right being extended to the OCI Cardholders by respondent No.1 in exercise of the powers under Section 7B(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (“Act 1955” for short), the petitioners were also assured of appearing for the NEET-UG exam so as to compete to secure a seat to pursue the medical course. 2.      Such right was available to the petitioners from a point almost immediately after their birth, since the petitioners in these petitions were born in the year 2003 onwards. Except for the fact that they were born in a foreign country, they had lived in this country for periods ranging from 10 to 15/17 years. In that view, the entire educational career was pursued in India, including the 12th standard so as to qualify for the NEET- UG examinations and MBBS Course. In fact, in most of the cases, both parents of the petitioners herein are Indian nationals and in any case, one of them is an Indian national. Even in cases where both the parents are OCI Cardholders, the children have lived most of their life in India since their roots remain to be in India where grandparents and family are here. 3.      When this was the position the respondent No.1 issued the notification dated 04.03.2021 in exercise of the power under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 whereunder the existing right of appearing for the Entrance Exams to compete with Indian Citizens for the seat was taken away and restricted the admission only as against the seats reserved for the Non-Resident Indians or for supernumerary seats. The proviso to clause 4(ii) of the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 in fact clarifies that the OCI cardholders shall not be eligible for admission against any seat reserved exclusively for Indian Citizens. This is done so, by providing an explanation that the OCI Cardholder is a foreign national holding passport from a foreign country and is not a citizen of India. 4.      The petitioners, therefore, contend that such notification falls foul of the Doctrine of Non -Retrogression since the right which was being bestowed from the year 2005, instead of progressing and maturing to be a better right was being curtailed and reversed. The petitioners also contend that the right guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India is violated since such right is available to “any person”, even if one is not a citizen of India. In the instant facts, the petitioners have no quarrel with the validity of Sections 7B(1), 7D, 8(1) and 9(1) of Act, 1955 . The petitioners while accepting the sovereign power of the respondents, are only aggrieved by the manner in which the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 is issued, by which an existing right has been taken away. The petitioners thus contend that they are not only OCI Cardholders, but are resident OCI Cardholders and therefore they should be treated like any other Citizen of India. Since respondent No.1 through the impugned notification has disentitled the OCI Cardholders from the process of admission to the seats to which the Indian citizens are entitled to participate in the selection process, they have approached this court assailing the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021, in these petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. 5.      The petitioners have accordingly sought for issue of an appropriate writ to quash clause 4(ii), its proviso and Explanation (1) as contained in the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 bearing F No.2611/CC/05/2018-OCI. 6.      The respondent No.1 has filed its objection statement seeking to justify the notification. It is necessary to take note herein that though in the instant batch of the petitions, the validity of the provisions in the Citizenship Act has not been assailed, in an another petition bearing W.P.(C) No.1397 of 2020 since there is a challenge to the said provisions and was earlier tagged with these petitions, the respondents in the common counter affidavit have also referred to the provisions of the Act and the Constitution of India in order to justify its validity. Since those aspects do not require consideration in this batch of cases, the objections by respondent No.1 insofar as seeking to justify the issue of the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 alone is taken note. In that regard, it is contended that as per the notification dated 11.04.2005, the OCI Cardholders were given parity with NRIs in the educational field. Under the notification dated 05.01.2009, the OCI Cardholder students were entitled to appear for All India Pre Medical Test and such other tests to make them eligible for admission. It is averred that a harmonious reading of 2005 and 2009 notifications leads to the conclusion that the OCI Cardholder students have parity to the NRIs and therefore can lay claim only to NRI quota seats. The educational right of OCI Cardholder students were discussed in a meeting of the Committee of Secretaries held on 19.07.2018 wherein it was agreed that the OCI Cardholders may be treated at par with NRI, in the quota of NRI and they ought not to be eligible against seats meant for Indian citizens. Hence, it was felt that relevant notifications be issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. In that view, the consolidated notification dated 04.03.2021 was issued in exercise of the power under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 whereby the earlier notifications of 2005, 2007 and 2009 were incorporated so as to bring clarity with regard to the various provisions. It is contended that the rationale is to protect the rights of the Indian Citizens and in such matters, State may give preference to its citizens vis-à-vis foreigners holding OCI Cards. In that regard it is stated that the number of seats available for medical and engineering courses in India are very limited and does not fully cater to the requirement of the Indian citizens. Hence the right to admission to such seats should be primarily available to Indian citizens instead of foreigners including OCI Cardholders. It is contended that the right to claim the protection under Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution are not available to a person who is not a citizen, more particularly in matters of education and is limited to the privilege bestowed through a notification issued under the Act. The respondent No.1 therefore seeks to justify and sustain the notification dated 04.03.2021, a portion of which is under challenge. 7.      In the light of the above we have heard Mr. P. Chidambaram and Mr. K.V. Viswanathan learned senior counsels for the respective petitioners as also Mr. Kunal Cheema and the other learned counsels appearing for the respective petitioners. We have also heard Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondents. In that light, we have perused the petition papers and all the documents made available to us. 8.      The summary of the arguments on behalf of the petitioners is as hereunder; This Court vide order dated 8.11.2021 in WP 1397 of 2020 passed a general order applicable to all eligible candidates who are similarly situated to appear for counselling in General at par with Indian citizens and same was made applicable to a variety of courses stated therein. Many of the Petitioners in WP No.891 of 2021, who were all NEET-2021 aspirants, appeared for NEET 2021 and also qualified and have secured admissions and are pursuing their academic courses. They would be in their 2nd year of studies. There would be other OCIs also who are not part of the writ petitions, but would have taken the benefit of the order dated 08.11.2021 passed by this Hon’ble Court, which was a general order applicable to all. The OCIs have been equated with NRIs all along since 2005 as regards various rights conferred under Section 7B(1) of the Citizenship Act and more particularly rights regarding education. That vide notification dated 05.01.2009, OCIs were permitted to carry out various professions in India as enumerated therein. That in view of the various rights having been given and more particularly education rights and right to work in India and also because many OCIs have their grandparents/families/roots in India, they came back to India long back and have been residing and working here and contributing to the nation like any other citizen in the form of taxes etc. The span of living here ranges as long as about 16 to 17 years. That till up to 04.03.2021 (impugned notification) , OCIs were entitled to seek admission to all seats like NRIs were (who are still entitled to) and not restricted to only NRI seats or supernumerary seats, but pursuant to the said portion of the impugned notification, OCIs are now entitled to only seats reserved for NRI i.e. NRI seats or supernumerary seats, which is discriminatory and violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Article 14 prohibits class legislation, but permits reasonable classification. However, for reasonable classification to be valid, there are twin tests i.e. (i) classification must be founded on intelligible differentia and (ii) that the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved. The seats have remained, unfilled. Hence Indian Citizens are not That Article 14 and 21 are available to “persons” and not only citizens and hence the OCIs who are “persons” and who have been residing in India for years together, in view of the rights of living (since life long visa is granted) and undertaking various professions in India granted under section 7B vide 05.01.2009 notification, have a right not to be discriminated against, which is guaranteed under Article 14 and also have a right of meaningful existence, which is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Moreover, there is no valid rationale for having withdrawn the said rights of being entitled to various seats other than seats reserved for NRIs, which they have been enjoying for considerable amount of time at par with NRIs, who today ( notification dated 12.10.2022) also are entitled to all seats including seats reserved for Non-Residents. It is further contended that the only object as can be culled out from the Counter Affidavit of the Respondent no.1 appears to be to protect rights of Indian citizens as seats are limited. However, if the statistics of past few years i.e 2018-2019 onwards are seen, even when the OCIs were entitled to all seats and they took admissions then, few hundred seats were remaining vacant at the end of final counselling. In fact the data also shows that seats have been significantly increased year on year, yet at the end of final counseling seats have remained vacant. Hence, it is clear that the said objective is a misnomer and the said portion of the impugned notification smacks of arbitrariness and non- application of mind. The said portion of the impugned notification falls foul of the doctrine of “non-retrogression” as discussed in the matter of Navtej Singh Johar [2018 (10) SCC 1], as it is resulting in withdrawal of the rights which the OCIs have enjoyed for the past several years. OCIs have taken up particular stream of education, passing 10th and 12th from schools in same state, meeting domicile/residence requirements, keeping in mind the rights which were available to them and hence their such acts would be saved as “things done” as per the words “except as respect things done or omitted to be done before such supersession” appearing in impugned notification dtd 04.03.2021. In support of this submission, reliance was placed on Universal Import Agency and Anr. v. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and Ors. The OCIs were entitled to have “legitimate expectation” as enshrined in the case of Navjyoti [1992 (4) SCC 477] that the said rights will continue to be available to them and not retrograded. That only a limited number of OCIs take the exam and out of them only a minuscule number clear the same and become eligible for admission. Hence no grave prejudice was being caused if the OCIs were allowed to seek admission to all seats based on merit and withdrawal of the same is therefore arbitrary and unreasonable. 9.     The summary of the contention on behalf of the respondents as put forth by the learned Additional Solicitor General is as follows; The present case essentially raises a singular issue with regard to the classification made between Indian citizens and Overseas Citizens of India cardholders and the same being statutory, whether it is sustainable. It is contended that the classification made by the impugned notification is supported by statutory provisions which legitimizes the State’s interest and ensures that the limited number of seats in educational institutions are available to Indian citizens and not taken away by foreigners. It is contended that for any sovereign country, the rights and privileges that are extended to the non-citizens are in exercise of inviolable sovereign powers and are essentially unfettered and unqualified. The courts have consistently declined to interfere in visa, immigration or such issues relating to foreigners. The power of exclusion of foreigners being an incident of sovereignty is that of the Government to be exercised. The OCI regime is a privilege extended by the Parliament and the Executive, falling squarely in the domain of the sovereign policy of the country. The Citizenship is regulated in Part II (Articles 5 to 11) of the Constitution of India pursuant to which the Citizenship Act is enacted to regulate the same. Section 2(ee) of the Citizenship Act defines OCI cardholders to mean a person registered as an Overseas Citizens of India cardholder by the Central Government under Section 7A of the Act. The learned Additional Solicitor General on referring to the said constitutional provisions and the Citizenship Act would point out that the privilege of securing education in India was pursuant to the conferment of the same in terms of Section 7(B) of the Act by the issue of notification. 10.    The Notification dated 04.03.2021 which is impugned in these petitions is issued by the Ministry in continuation of the policy of the Union of India in conformity with the constitutional principles. With reference to the Notification, it is contended that it is very evident and clear that the intention was not to give the OCI cardholders parity with Indian citizens at any stage with regard to admission but the parity was always with NRIs. The policy was consistent from 2004 when the OCI cardholders’ mechanism was started, to treat them at par with the NRIs. However, there was some dichotomy in the interpretation of the earlier Notifications and the benefit which was available to the NRIs for the seats along with Indian citizen students was also being extended. Therefore, after comprehensive consultation on the educational rights of the OCI cardholders in the meeting held on 19.07.2018 it was decided that the OCI cardholders may be treated at par with NRIs in the quota for NRI seats and they would not be eligible against the seats meant for Indian citizens. 11.     Hence the issue of the consolidated Notification of 04.03.2021 was in supersession of earlier Notifications of 2005 , 2007, and 2009 to bring clarity with regard to various provisions which were under consideration of the Ministry of Home Affairs for quite some time. In this context, consultations were held with all stakeholders and the Notification was issued. 12.     Reference to the judgments cited by the learned Additional Solicitor General to substantiate her contention that the consideration with regard to the validity of the Notification cannot be of a similar purport when it is assailed by the citizens of India and other decisions referred to would be considered at the appropriate stage. The sum and substance of the contention is that the decision is with the object of legitimate public interest and in the interest of the Indian citizens. Hence, it is contended that the impugned Notification does not call for interference and the petitioners are not entitled to seek any relief from this Court. 13.     In the light of rival contentions, at the threshold it is necessary to take note that though the arguments were elaborately addressed and the learned Additional Solicitor General referred in detail to the provisions of the constitution relating to citizenship and also the sovereign power of the respondent No.1 under the Act, 1955, we do not find it necessary to dwell into much detail in this batch of petitions. This is for the reason that from the very case put forth by the petitioners they are not questioning the power of respondent No.1 to issue notifications prescribing the right in respect of OCI Cardholders. However, the grievance is only that a right which existed in their favour has been altered to their detriment without application of mind to the fact that most of the petitioners have spent their entire lifetime in India and also pursued their educational careers in India including appearing for the qualifying exam. As such the only grievance of the petitioners herein is with regard to the proviso to clause 4(ii) and Explanation contained in the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 whereunder a limitation has been prescribed wherein they have been made entitled only to the seats available to NRIs and they have been specifically excluded from seeking admission to the seats which are exclusively available to the Indian citizens. 14.     In that regard, the provisions of Act, 1955 which are to be noted read as “7A. Registration of overseas citizens of India Cardholder.-(1) The Central Government may, subject to such conditions, restrictions and manner as may be prescribed, on an application made in this behalf, register as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder- (a)     any person of full age and capacity,- (b)     who is citizen of another country, but was a citizen of India at the time of, or at any time after, the commencement of the Constitution; or (c)     who is citizen of another country, but was eligible to become a citizen of India at the time of the commencement of the Constitution; or (d)     who is citizen of another country, but belonged to a territory that became part of India after the 15th day of August, 1947; or (e)     who is a child or a grandchild or a great grandchild of such a citizen; or (b)     a person, who is a minor child of a person mentioned in clause (a); or (c)     a person, who is a minor child, and whose both parents are citizens of India or one of the parents is a citizen of India; or (d)     spouse of foreign origin of citizen of India or spouse of foreign origin of an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder registered under section 7A and whose marriage has been registered and subsisted for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the application under this section: Provided that for the eligibility for registration as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder, such spouse shall be subjected to prior security clearance by a competent authority in India: Provided further that no person, who or either of whose parents or grandparents or great grandparents is or had been a citizen of Pakistan, Bangladesh or such other country as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify, shall be eligible for registration as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder under this sub-section. 2.      The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify the date from which the existing Persons of Indian Origin Cardholders shall be deemed to be Overseas Citizens of Indian Cardholders. Explanation.- For the purposes of this subsection, “Persons of Indian Origin Cardholders” means the persons registered as such under notification number 26011/4/98 F.I., dated the 19th August, 2002, issued by the Central Government in this regard. 3.      Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1), the Central Government may, if it is satisfied that special circumstances exist, after recording the circumstances in writing, register a person as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder.” “7B. Conferment of rights on Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder shall be entitled to such rights [other than the rights specified under sub-section (2)] as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this (2) An Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder shall not be entitled to the rights conferred on a (a)     under article 16 of the Constitution with regard to equality of opportunity in matters of (b)     under article 58 of the Constitution for election as President: (c)     under article 66 of the Constitution for election of Vice-President; (d)     under article 124 of the Constitution for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court; (e)     under article 217 of the Constitution for appointment as a Judge of the High Court; (f)     under section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (43 of 1950) in regard (g)     under sections 3 and 4 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) with regard to the eligibility for being a member of the House of the People or of the Council (h)     under sections 5, 5A and 6 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) with regard to the eligibility for being a member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council, as the case may be, of a State; (i)     for appointment to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State except for appointment in such services and posts as the Central Government may, by special order in that behalf specify. (3) Every notification issued under sub-section (1) shall be laid before each House of 15.     The above-noted provisions were inserted initially during the year 2004 and were thereafter substituted on the introduction of the provisions in the year 2005 and substituted time to time thereafter. On foreign citizens of such category being given the status of OCI Cardholders, it also provided for conferment of rights on OCI Cardholders as contemplated under Section 7B of Act, 1955 (supra). 16.     In exercise of the said power under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 the notification dated 11.04.2005 was issued which provides as hereunder:- S.O. 542(E)- In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section (1) of Section 7B of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), the Central Government hereby specifies the following rights to which the persons registered as Overseas Citizens of India under Section 7A of the said Act shall be entitled, namely:- (a)     grant of multiple entry lifelong visa for visiting India for any purpose; (b)     exemption from registration with Foreign Regional Officer or Foreign Registration Officer for any length of stay in India; and (c)     parity with Non-Resident Indians in respect of all facilities available to them in economic, financial and educational fields except in matters relating to the acquisition of agricultural or plantation properties. 17.     Through the said notification, apart from granting multiple entry life-long visa for visiting India for any purpose, insofar as economic, financial and educational fields, parity with Non-Resident Indians was provided, except for acquisition of agricultural or plantation properties. By a subsequent notification dated 05.01.2007 issued under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955, though no right relating to the field of education was referred to, the OCI Cardholders were given similar treatment with Non-Resident Indians in the matter of inter-country adoption of Indian children and also to be treated at par with the Indian Nationals in the matter of tariffs in air fares and also for same entry fee being charged to domestic Indian visitors to visit National Parks and Wildlife 18.     Further, a notification dated 05.01.2009 relating to pursuing professions and admission to professional course was issued, which reads as hereunder: S.O.36(E) - In exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (1) of Section 7B of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955), and in continuation of the notifications of the Government of India in the Ministry of Home Affairs number S.O.542(E), dated the 11th April, 2005 and in the Ministry of Overseas Affairs S.O.12(E), dated the 6th January, 2007, the Central Government hereby specifies the following rights to which the persons registered as the overseas citizen of India under Section 7A of the said Act, shall be entitled, namely :- (a)     Parity with non-resident Indian in respect of,- (i)     Entry fees to be charged for visiting the national monuments, historical sites and (ii)    Pursuing the following professions in India, in pursuance of the provisions contained (i)     Doctors, dentists, nurses and pharmacists; (b)     To appear for the All India Pre-Medical Test or such other tests to make them eligible for admission in pursuance of the provisions contained in the relevant Acts. 19.     Through the said notification dated 05.01.2009 the OCI Cardholders were given the right to pursue the professions indicated therein, in India and also to appear for the All-Indian Pre-Medical Test or such other tests to make them eligible for admission in pursuance of the provisions contained in the relevant Acts. Since NRIs had parity with the Indian Citizens in that regard, the same benefit became extended to the OCI Cardholders including the petitioners herein. 20.     A cumulative perusal of the three notifications of 2005, 2007 and 2009 heavily relied on by the learned senior counsel for the petitioners would certainly indicate that from the stage of amendment to Act, 1955 through Section 7A to 7 D thereof and the notifications issued pursuant thereto, conferring rights under Section 7B(1) and such right being expanded from stage to stage, it would indicate that based on the need, progression was made in conferring better right to the Overseas Citizens of India who, except for the incident of their birth in a foreign country were in all other respects similarly placed as that of Indian citizens and the limited foreign affiliation of NRI and OCI Cardholders made them to be compared with each other for parity. In fact, for the purpose of air fares and entry fee to places of interest, they were given parity with Indian nationals. It is in that view contended that taking away such a right that was available in the changing social scenario would amount to retrogression when in fact better right should have been conferred. 21.     In that background, it would be necessary to refer to the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 which reads as hereunder: S.O. 1050(E) – In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 7B of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955) and in supersession of the notification of the Government of India in the Ministry of Home Affairs published in the Official Gazette vide number S.O. 542(E), dated the 11th April, 2005 and the notifications of the Government of India in the erstwhile Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs published in the Official Gazette vide numbers S.O. 12(E), dated the 5th January, 2007 and S.O. 36(E), dated the 5th January, 2009, except as respect things done or omitted to be done before such supersession, the Central Government hereby specifies the following rights to which an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder (hereinafter referred to as the OCI cardholder) shall be entitled, with effect from the date of publication of this notification in the Official Gazette, namely:- (1) grant of multiple entry lifelong visa for visiting India for any purpose Provided that for undertaking the following activities, the OCI cardholder shall be required to obtain a special permission or a Special Permit, as the case may be, from the competent authority or the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer or the Indian Mission concerned, (ii)    to undertake any Missionary or Tabligh or Mountaineering or Journalistic activities; (iii)   to undertake internship in any foreign Diplomatic Missions or foreign Government organisations in India or to take up employment in any foreign Diplomatic Missions in India; (iv)    to visit any place which falls within the Protected or Restricted or prohibited areas as notified by the Central Government or competent authority; (2)     exemption from registration with the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer or Foreigners Registration Officer for any length of stay in India: Provided that the OCI cardholders who are normally resident in India shall intimate the jurisdictional Foreigners Regional Registration Officer or the Foreigners Registration Officer by email whenever there is a change in permanent residential address and in their (3)     parity with Indian nationals in the matter of,- (ii)    entry fees to be charged for visiting national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, the national monuments, historical sites and museums in India; (i)     inter-country adoption of Indian children subject to the compliance of the procedure as laid down by the competent authority for such adoption; (ii)    appearing for the all India entrance tests such as National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, Joint Entrance Examination (Mains), Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced) or such other tests to make them eligible for admission only against any Non-Resident Indian seat or any supernumerary seat; Provided that the OCI cardholder shall not be eligible for admission against any seat reserved exclusively for Indian citizens. (iii)   Purchase or sale of immovable properties other than agricultural land or farm house (iv)    Pursuing the following professions in India as per the provisions contained in the applicable relevant statutes or Acts as the case may be, namely:- (5)     in respect of all other economic, financial and educational fields not specified in this notification or the rights and privileges not covered by the notifications made by the Reserve Bank of India under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) , the OCI cardholder shall have the same rights and privileges as a foreigner. Explanation – For the purposes of this notification,- (1)     The OCI Cardholder (including a PIO cardholder) is a foreign national holding passport of a foreign country and is not a citizen of India. (2)     “Non-resident Indian” shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in the Foreign Exchange Management (Acquisition and Transfer of Immovable Property in India) Regulations, 2018 made by the Reserve Bank of India under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and who fulfills the “Non-Resident Indian” status as per the Income Tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961). 22.     A perusal of the notification dated 04.03.2021 would ex facie indicate that the rights bestowed thereunder on the OCI Cardholders are in fact a consolidation of the rights which had been bestowed through the notification dated 11.04.2005, 05.01.2007 and 05.01.2009. However, the impugned portion of the notification is the portion which has been emphasised i.e. the proviso to clause 4(ii) and Explanation (1) thereto and limiting the parity only to NRI seats and supernumerary seats. Through the impugned portion of the notification, the parity which existed with Non-Resident Indians including in the field of education has been modified to indicate their eligibility for admission only against any “Non-Resident Indian seat” or any supernumerary seat. It is relevant to take note herein that the Non-Resident Indians apart from the seats reserved only for Non-Resident Indians, are also entitled to participate in the selection process for allotment of seats along with the Indian citizens for the remaining seats as well, which benefit was hitherto available to OCI Cardholders by virtue of their parity with NRIs. However, by presently specifying that the OCI Cardholders would be eligible for only the Non-Resident Indian seat or any supernumerary seat, the right available to the OCI Cardholders is only for the seats which are reserved as NRI quota seats, for which they would have to compete with the NRI candidates for the limited number of seats, for which higher fee structure is also fixed. The proviso thereto makes it clear that the OCI Cardholders shall not be eligible for admission against any seat reserved exclusively for Indian citizens. The provision contained in the impugned portion of the notification dated 04.03.2021 would indicate that the OCI Cardholders even if they have settled down in India and have undergone their entire educational course in India but not having renounced the citizenship of a foreign country and not having acquired the citizenship of India will now be denied the opportunity of securing a medical seat in the general pool of Indian citizens including NRIs and will have to compete only for the limited seats available under the NRI quota, which would be a denial of an opportunity of education to such OCI Cardholders which was hitherto available. It is in that view contended that a legitimate expectation of the petitioners herein is being defeated and they are also being discriminated upon due to which there is a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. 23.    In the above backdrop it would be appropriate to refer to the precedents cited and relied upon by the learned counsel for all the parties including the respondents. 24.    In support of the case of the petitioners, Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel placed reliance on the decision in (1978) 1 SCC 248 Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India, to contend that unreasonable classification is not permissible, wherein, inter alia, it is held as hereunder; “7. Now, the question immediately arises as to what is the requirement of Article 14: what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle enunciated in this article? There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach. No attempt should be made to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits. We must reiterate here what was pointed out by the majority in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu namely, that “from a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14”. Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14. It must be “right and just and fair” and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied.” 25.    On the contention relating to the doctrine of nonretrogression the decision in Navtej Singh Johar & Ors. vs. Union of India Thr. Secretary Ministry of Law and Justice (2018) 10 SCC 1 is relied upon, wherein it is observed as hereunder: “199. What the words of Lord Roskill suggest is that it is not only the interpretation of the Constitution which needs to be pragmatic, due to the dynamic nature of a Constitution, but also the legal policy of a particular epoch must be in consonance with the current and the present needs of the society, which are sensible in the prevalent times and at the same time easy to apply. 200. This also gives birth to an equally important role of the State to implement the constitutional rights effectively. And of course, when we say State, it includes all the three organs, that is, the legislature, the executive as well as the judiciary. The State has to show concerned commitment which would result in concrete action. The State has an obligation to take appropriate measures for the progressive realisation of economic, social and cultural 201. The doctrine of progressive realisation of rights, as a natural corollary, gives birth to the doctrine of non-retrogression. As per this doctrine, there must not be any regression of rights. In a progressive and an ever-improving society, there is no place for retreat. The society has to march ahead. 202. The doctrine of non-retrogression sets forth that the State should not take measures or steps that deliberately lead to retrogression on the enjoyment of rights either under the Constitution or otherwise.” Research Centre was relied on to contend that every activity of public authority must be informed by reasons and guided by public interest and the exercise of discretion or power by public authority must be judged by that standard. Para 24 and 30 of the decision relied upon is as hereunder: “24. In Dwarkadas Marfatia & Sons v. Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay [(1989) 3 SCC 293 : (1989) 2 SCR 751] it was held that the Corporation must act in accordance with certain constitutional conscience and whether they have so acted must be discernible from the conduct of such Corporations. Every activity of public authority must be informed by reasons and guided by the public interest. All exercises of discretion or power by public authority must be judged by that standard. In that case when the building owned by the port trust was exempted from the Rent Act, on terminating the tenancy for development when possession was sought to be taken, it was challenged under Article 226 that the action of the port trust was arbitrary and no public interest would be served by terminating the tenancy. In that context, this Court held that even in contractual relations the Court cannot ignore that the public authority must have constitutional conscience so that any interpretation put up must be to avoid arbitrary action, lest the authority would be permitted to flourish as imperium in imperio. Whatever be the activity of the public authority, it must meet the test of Article 14 and judicial review strikes an arbitrary action. 30. The contention of the appellants is that the offending clause is a valid classification. The salaried group of lives from the Government, semi-Government or reputed commercial institutions form a class. With a view to identify the health conditions, the policy was applied to that class of lives. No mandamus would be issued to declare the classification as unconstitutional when it bears reasonable nexus to the object and there is intelligible differentia between the salaried lives and the rest. The High Court, therefore, was wrong in declaring the offending clause as arbitrary violating Article 14. It is true that the appellant is entitled to issue the policy applicable to a particular group or class of lives entitled to avail contract of insurance with the appellant but a class or a group does mean that the classification meets the demand of equality, fairness and justness. The doctrine of classification is only a subsidiary rule evolved by the courts to give practical content to the doctrine of equality, overemphasis on the doctrine of classification or anxious or sustained attempt to discover some basis for classification may gradually and imperceptibly erode the profound potency of the glorious content of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution. The overemphasis on classification would inevitably result in substitution of the doctrine of classification to the doctrine of equality and the Preamble of the Constitution which is an integral part and scheme of the Constitution. Maneka Gandhi [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248] ratio extricated it from this moribund and put its elasticity for egalitarian path finder lest the classification would deny equality to the larger segments of the society. The classification based on employment in Government, semi-Government and reputed commercial firms has the insidious and inevitable effect of excluding lives in vast rural and urban areas engaged in unorganised or self-employed sectors to have life insurance offending Article 14 of the Constitution and socio-economic justice.” 27.      Shri K.V. Viswanathan, learned senior counsel while contending that the right which had accrued cannot be taken away and the ‘things done’ or ‘omitted to be done’ before such supersession is to be kept in view, has relied on the decision in (1961) 1 SCR 305 Universal Imports Agency & Ans. Vs. Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and Ors. wherein it is held as hereunder: “16. What were the “things done” by the petitioners under the Pondicherry law? The petitioners in the course of their import trade, having obtained authorization for the foreign exchange through their bankers, entered into firm contracts with foreign dealers on C.I.F. terms. In some cases irrevocable Letters of Credit were opened and in others bank drafts were sent towards the contracts. Under the terms of the contracts the sellers had to ship the goods from various foreign ports and the buyers were to have physical delivery of the goods after they had crossed the customs barrier in India. Pursuant to the terms of the contracts, the sellers placed the goods on board the various ships, some before and others after the merger, and the goods arrived at Pondicherry port after its merger with India. The prices for the goods were paid in full to the foreign sellers and the goods were taken delivery of by the buyers after examining them on arrival. Before the merger if the Customs Authorities had imposed any restrictions not authorised by law, the affected parties could have enforced the free entry of the goods in a court of law. On the said facts a short question arises whether para 6 of the Order protects the petitioners. While learned counsel for the petitioners contends that “things done” take in not only things done but also their legal consequences, learned counsel for the State contends that, as the goods were not brought into India before the merger, it was not a thing done before the merger and, therefore, would be governed by the enactments specified in the Schedule. It is not necessary to consider in this case whether the concept of import not only takes in the factual bringing of goods into India, but also the entire process of import commencing from the date of the application for permission to import and ending with the crossing of the customs barrier in India. The words “things done” in para 6 must be reasonably interpreted and, if so interpreted, they can mean not only things done but also the legal consequences flowing therefrom. If the interpretation suggested by the learned counsel for the respondents be accepted, the saving clause would become unnecessary. If what it saves is only the executed contracts i.e. the contracts whereunder the goods have been imported and received by the buyer before the merger, no further protection is necessary as ordinarily no question of enforcement of the contracts under the pre-existing law would arise. The phraseology used is not an innovation but is copied from other statutory clauses. Section 6 of the General clauses Act (10 of 1897) says that unless a different intention appears, the repeal of an Act shall not affect anything duly done or suffered thereunder. So too, the Public Health Act of 1858 (38 & 39 Vict. c. 55) which repealed the Public Health Act of 1848 contained a proviso to Section 343 to the effect that the repeal “shall not affect anything duly done or suffered under the enactment hereby repealed”, This proviso came under judicial scrutiny in Queen v. Justices of the West Riding of Yorkshire [(1876) 1 QBD 220] . There notice was given by a local board of health of intention to make a rate under the Public Health Act, 1848, and amending Acts. Before the notice had expired these Acts were repealed by the Public Health Act, 1875, which contained a saving of “anything duly done” under the repealed enactments, and gave power to make a similar rate upon giving a similar notice. The board, in ignorance of the repeal, made a rate purporting to be made under the repealed Acts. It was contended that as the rate was made after the repealing Act, the notice given under the repealed Act was not valid. The learned Judges held that as the notice was given before the Act, the making of the rate was also saved by the words “anything duly done” under the repealed enactments. This case illustrates the point that it is not necessary that an impugned thing in itself should have been done before the Act was repealed, but it would be enough if it was integrally connected with and was a legal consequence of a thing done before the said repeal. Under similar circumstances Lindley, L.J., in Heston and Isleworth Urban District Council v. Grout [(1897) 2 Ch 306] confirmed the validity of the rate made pursuant to a notice issued prior to the repeal. Adverting to the saving clause, the learned Judge tersely states the principle thus at p. 313:“That to my mind preserves that notice and the effect of it”. On that principle the court of appeal held that the rate which was the effect of the notice was good.” 28.     The learned senior counsel, further on the principle of legitimate expectation, relied on the decision in (1992) 4 SCC 477 Navjyoti Coop.Group Housing Society and Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors. wherein it is observed as hereunder: “15. It also appears to us that in any event the new policy decision as contained in the impugned memorandum of January 20, 1990 should not have been implemented without making such change in the existing criterion for allotment known to the Group Housing Societies if necessary by way of a public notice so that they might make proper representation to the concerned authorities for consideration of their viewpoints. Even assuming that in the absence of any explanation of the expression “first come first served” in Rule 6(vi) of Nazul Rules there was no statutory requirement to make allotment with reference to date of registration, it has been rightly held, as a matter of fact, by the High Court that prior to the new guideline contained in the memo of January 20, 1990 the principle for allotment had always been on the basis of date of registration and not the date of approval of the list of members. In the brochure issued in 1982 by the DDA even after Gazette notification of Nazul Rules on September 26, 1981 the policy of allotment on the basis of seniority in registration was clearly indicated. In the aforesaid facts, the Group Housing Societies were entitled to ‘legitimate expectation’ of following consistent past practice in the matter of allotment, even though they may not have any legal right in private law to receive such treatment. The existence of ‘legitimate expectation’ may have a number of different consequences and one of such consequences is that the authority ought not to act to defeat the ‘legitimate expectation’ without some overriding reason of public policy to justify its doing so. In a case of ‘legitimate expectation’ if the authority proposes to defeat a person's ‘legitimate expectation’ it should afford him an opportunity to make representations in the matter. In this connection reference may be made to the discussions on ‘legitimate expectation’ at page 151 of Volume 1(1) of Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th edn. ( re-issue). We may also refer to a decision of the House of Lords in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [(1984) 3 All ER 935] . It has been held in the said decision that an aggrieved person was entitled to judicial review if he could show that a decision of the public authority affected him of some benefit or advantage which in the past he had been permitted to enjoy and which he legitimately expected to be permitted to continue to enjoy either until he was given reasons for withdrawal and the opportunity to comment on such reasons. 16. It may be indicated here that the doctrine of ‘legitimate expectation’ imposes in essence a duty on public authority to act fairly by taking into consideration all relevant factors relating to such ‘legitimate expectation’. Within the conspectus of fair dealing in case of ‘legitimate expectation’, the reasonable opportunities to make representation by the parties likely to be affected by any change of consistent past policy, come in. We, have not been shown any compelling reasons taken into consideration by the Central Government to make a departure from the existing policy of allotment with reference to seniority in registration by introducing a new guideline. On the contrary, Mr Jaitley the learned counsel has submitted that the DDA and/or Central Government do not intend to challenge the decision of the High Court and the impugned memorandum of January 20, 1990 has since been withdrawn. We therefore feel that in the facts of the case it was only desirable that before introducing or implementing any change in the guideline for allotment, an opportunity to make representations against the proposed change in the guideline should have been given to the registered Group Housing Societies, if necessary, by way of a public notice.” 29.     On behalf of the petitioners the decision to explain the Doctrine of Ultra Vires was also relied in (2007) 13 SCC 673 J.K. Industry Ltd. vs. Union of India wherein “127. At the outset, we may state that on account of globalisation and socio-economic problems ( including income disparities in our economy) the power of delegation has become a constituent element of legislative power as a whole. However, as held in Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, SCC at p. 689 , subordinate legislation does not carry the same degree of immunity which is enjoyed by a statute passed by a competent legislature. Subordinate legislation may be questioned on any of the grounds on which plenary legislation is questioned. In addition, it may also be questioned on the ground that it does not conform to the statute under which it is made. It may further be questioned on the ground that it is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act or that it is contrary to some other statute applicable on the same subject-matter. Therefore, it has to yield to plenary legislation. It can also be questioned on the ground that it is manifestly arbitrary and unjust. That, any inquiry into its vires must be confined to the grounds on which plenary legislation may be questioned, to the grounds that it is contrary to the statute under which it is made, to the grounds that it is contrary to other statutory provisions or on the ground that it is so patently arbitrary that it cannot be said to be in conformity with the statute. It can also be challenged on the ground that it violates Article 14 of the Constitution. 128. Subordinate legislation cannot be questioned on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice on which administrative action may be questioned. A distinction must, however, be made between delegation of a legislative function in which case the question of reasonableness cannot be gone into and the investment by the statute to exercise a particular discretionary power. In the latter case, the question may be considered on all grounds on which administrative action may be questioned, such as, non-application of mind, taking irrelevant matters into consideration, failure to take relevant matters into consideration, etc. A subordinate legislation may be struck down as arbitrary or contrary to statute if it fails to take into account vital facts which expressly or by necessary implication are required to be taken into account by the statute or the Constitution. This can be done on the ground that the subordinate legislation does not conform to the statutory or constitutional requirements or that it offends Article 14 or Article 19 of the Constitution. However, it may be noted that, a notification issued under a section of the statute which requires it to be laid before Parliament does not make any substantial difference as regards the jurisdiction of the court to pronounce on its validity.” 30.     Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General, in seeking to distinguish the above-referred decisions contended that the cases referred to by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner are all in the context of the issues which had arisen in matters relating to Citizens of India against the State/Authorities or when the dispute arose for consideration inter se between the Citizens of India. In that view, it is contended that the petitioner cannot claim protection under Article 14, 19 or 21 of the Constitution of India. Even for claiming any right under Article 14, the same will emerge from Article 19 of the Constitution and as such protection cannot be accorded to foreigners. 31.     In addition, the learned Additional Solicitor General, to emphasize that a policy decision in public interest cannot be interfered, referred to the decision in (1998) 4 SCC 117 State of Punjab and Ors. Vs. Ram Lubhaya Bagga & Ors.: “25. Now we revert to the last submission, whether the new State policy is justified in not reimbursing an employee, his full medical expenses incurred on such treatment, if incurred in any hospital in India not being a government hospital in Punjab. Question is whether the new policy which is restricted by the financial constraints of the State to the rates in AIIMS would be in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. So far as questioning the validity of governmental policy is concerned in our view it is not normally within the domain of any court, to weigh the pros and cons of the policy or to scrutinize it and test the degree of its beneficial or equitable disposition for the purpose of varying, modifying or annulling it, based on howsoever sound and good reasoning, except where it is arbitrary or violative of any constitutional, statutory or any other provision of law. When Government forms its policy, it is based on a number of circumstances on facts, law including constraints based on its resources. It is also based on expert opinion. It would be dangerous if court is asked to test the utility, beneficial effect of the policy or its appraisal based on facts set out on affidavits. The court would dissuade itself from entering into this realm which belongs to the executive. It is within this matrix that it is to be seen whether the new policy violates Article 21 when it restricts reimbursement on account of its financial constraints.” 32.      On the contention relating to the reasonable classification test and a foreigner not having right, the following decisions are relied upon by the learned Additional (i)      AIR 1962 SC 1052 Izhar Ahmed Khan & Ors. vs. Union of India. “38. The next point to consider is about the validity of Section 9(2) itself. It is argued that this rule is ultra vires because it affects the status of citizenship conferred on the petitioners and recognised by the relevant articles of the Constitution, and it is urged that by depriving the petitioners of the status of citizenship, their fundamental rights under Article 19 generally and particularly the right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(e) are affected. It is not easy to appreciate this argument. As we have already observed, the scheme of the relevant articles of Part II which deals with citizenship clearly suggests that the status of citizenship can be adversely affected by a statute made by the Parliament in exercise of its legislative powers. It may prima facie sound somewhat surprising, but it is nevertheless true, that though the citizens of India are guaranteed the fundamental rights specified in Article 19 of the Constitution, the status of citizenship on which the existence or continuance of the said rights rests is itself not one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to anyone. If a law is properly passed by the Parliament affecting the status of citizenship of any citizens in the country, it can be no challenge to the validity of the said law that it affects the fundamental rights of those whose citizenship is thereby terminated. Article 19 proceeds on the assumption that the person who claims the rights guaranteed by it is a citizen of India. If the basic status of citizenship is validly terminated by a Parliamentary statute, the person whose citizenship is terminated has no right to claim the fundamental rights under Article 19. Therefore, in our opinion, the challenge to Section 9(2) on the ground that it enables the rule-making authority to make a rule to deprive the citizenship rights of the petitioners cannot be sustained.” (ii)     AIR 1964 SC 1140 Indo-China Steam Navigation Co.Ltd. vs. Jasjit Singh & 35. There is one more point which must be mentioned before we part with this appeal. Mr Choudhary attempted to argue that if mens rea was not regarded as an essential element of Section 52-A, the said section would be ultra vires Articles 14, 19 and 31(1) and as such, unconstitutional and invalid. We do not propose to consider the merits of this argument, because the appellant is not only a company, but also a foreign company, and as such, is not entitled to claim the benefits of Article 19. It is only citizens of India who have been guaranteed the right to freedom enshrined in the said article. If that is so, the plea under Article 31(1) as well as under Article 14 cannot be sustained for the simple reason that in supporting the said two pleas, inevitably the appellant has for fall back upon the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(f). The whole argument is that the appellant is deprived of its property by operation of the relevant provisions of the Act and these provisions are invalid. All that Article 31(1) provides is that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. As soon as this plea is raised, it is met by the obvious answer that the appellant has been deprived of its property by authority of the provisions of the Act and that would be the end of the plea under Article 31(1) unless the appellant is able to take the further step of challenging the validity of the act, and that necessarily imports Article 19(1)(f). Similarly, when a plea is raised under Article 14, we face the same position. It may be that if Section 52-A contravenes Article 19(1)(f), a citizen of India may contend that his vessel cannot be confiscated even if it has contravened Section 52-A, and in that sense, there would be inequality between the citizen and the foreigner, but that inequality is the necessary consequence of the basic fact that Article 19 is confined to citizens of India, and so, the plea that Article 14 is contravened also must take in Article 19 if it has to succeed. The plain truth is that certain rights guaranteed to the citizens of India under Article 19 are not available to foreigners and pleas which may successfully be raised by the citizens on the strength of the said rights guaranteed under Article 19 would, therefore, not be available to foreigners. That being so, we see no substance in the argument that if Section 52- A is construed against the appellant, it would be invalid, and so, the appellant would be able to resist the confiscation of its vessel under Article 31(1) . We ought to make it clear that we are expressing no opinion on the validity of Section 52-A under Article 19(1)(f) . If the said question were to arise for our decision in any case, we would have to consider whether the provisions of Section 52-A are not justified by Article 19(5). That is a matter which is foreign to the enquiry in the present appeal. “75. It is true that fundamental right is available to a foreigner as held in Louis De Raedt v. Union of India [(1991) 3 SCC 554: 1991 SCC (Cri) 886] : (SCC p. 562, para 13) “The next point taken on behalf of the petitioners, that the foreigners also enjoy some fundamental rights under the Constitution of this country, is also of not much help to them. The fundamental right of the foreigner is confined to Article 21 for life and liberty and does not include the right to reside and settle in this country, as mentioned in Article 19(1)(e) , which is applicable only to the citizens of this country.” As such Articles 19(1)(d) and (e) are unavailable to foreigners because those rights are conferred only on the citizens. Certainly, the machinery of Article 14 cannot be invoked to obtain that fundamental right. Rights under Articles 19(1)(d) and (e) are expressly withheld to foreigners.” “19. We do not agree and will first examine the position where an order of expulsion is made before any steps to enforce it are taken. The right to expel is conferred by Section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946 on the Central Government and the right to enforce an order of expulsion and also to prevent any breach of it, and the right to use such force as may be reasonably necessary “for the effective exercise of such power” is conferred by Section 11(1), also on the Central Government. There is, therefore, implicit in the right of expulsion a number of ancillary rights, among them, the right to prevent any breach of the order and the right to use force and to take effective measures to carry out those purposes. Now the most effective method of preventing a breach of the order and ensuring that it is duly obeyed is by arresting and detaining the person ordered to be expelled until proper arrangements for the expulsion can be made. Therefore, the right to make arrangements for an expulsion includes the right to make arrangements for preventing any evasion or breach of the order, and the Preventive Detention Act confers the power to use the means of preventive detention as one of the methods of achieving this end. How far it is necessary to take this step in a given case is a matter that must be left to the discretion of the Government concerned, but, in any event, when criminal charges for offences said to have been committed in this country and abroad are levelled against a person, an apprehension that he is likely to disappear and evade an order of expulsion cannot be called either unfounded or unreasonable. Detention in such circumstances is rightly termed preventive and falls within the ambit of the Preventive Detention Act and is reasonably related to the purpose of the Act. 35. The Foreigners Act confers the power to expel foreigners from India. It vests the Central Government with absolute and unfettered discretion and, as there is no provision fettering this discretion in the Constitution, an unrestricted right to expel remains. 42. Our conclusion is that the Foreigners Act is not governed by the provisions of the Extradition Act. The two are distinct and neither impinges on the other. Even if there is a requisition and a good case for extradition, Government is not bound to accede to the request. It is given an unfettered right to refuse. Section 3(1) of the Extradition Act says—“the Central Government may, if it thinks fit”. Therefore, if it chooses not to comply with the request, the person against whom the request is made cannot insist that it should. The right is not his; and the fact that a request has been made does not fetter the discretion of Government to choose the less cumbrous procedure of the Foreigners Act when a foreigner is concerned, provided always, that in that event the person concerned leaves India a free man. If no choice had been left to the Government, the position would have been different but as Government is given the right to choose, no question of want of good faith can arise merely because it exercises the right of choice which the law confers. This line of attack on the good faith of Government falls to the ground.” 33.      In order to contend that the classification made is valid, the learned Additional Solicitor General has referred to the decision in; “63. In order to appreciate this contention, it is necessary to state shortly the scope of Article 14 of the Constitution. It is designed to prevent any person or class of persons from being singled out as a special subject for discriminatory and hostile legislation. Democracy implies respect for the elementary rights of man, however suspect or unworthy. Equality of right is a principle of republicanism and Article 14 enunciates this equality principle in the administration of justice. In its application to legal proceedings the Article assures to everyone the same rules of evidence and modes of procedure. In other words, the same rule must exist for all in similar circumstances. This principle, however, does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or circumstance, in the same position. 64. By the process of classification the State has the power of determining who should be regarded as a class for purposes of legislation and in relation to a law enacted on a particular subject. This power, no doubt, in some degree is likely to produce some inequality; but if a law deals with the liberties of a number of welldefined classes, it is not open to the charge of denial of equal protection on the ground that it has no application to other persons. The classification permissible, however, must be based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the objects sought to be attained and cannot be made arbitrarily and without any substantial basis. Classification thus means segregation in classes which have a systematic relation, usually found in common properties and characteristics. It postulates a rational basis and does not mean herding together of certain persons and classes arbitrarily. Thus the legislature may fix the age at which persons shall be deemed competent to contract between themselves, but no one will claim that competency to contract can be made to depend upon the stature or colour of the hair. “Such a classification for such a purpose would be arbitrary and a piece of legislative despotism”. (ii)     (1955) 1 SCR 1045 Budhan Choudhary Vs. State of Bihar “5. The provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution have come up for discussion before this Court in a number of cases, namely, Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India [(1950) 1 SCR 869], State of Bombay v. F.N. Balsara [(1951) 2 SCR 682] , State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar [(1952) 3 SCR 284] , Kathi Raning Rawat v. State of Saurashtra [(1952) 3 SCR 435] , Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja v. State of Bombay [(1952) 3 SCR 710] and Qasim Razvi v. State of Hyderabad [AIR 1953 SC 156 : (1953) 4 SCR 581] and Habeeb Mohamad v. State of Hyderabad [(1953) 4 SCR 661]. It is, therefore, not necessary to enter upon any lengthy discussion as to the meaning, scope and effect of the article in question. It is now well established that while Article 14 forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question. The classification may be founded on different bases; namely, geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like. What is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act under consideration. It is also well established by the decisions of this Court that Article 14 condemns discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure. The contention now put forward as to the invalidity of the trial of the appellants has, therefore to be tested in the light of the principles so laid down in the decisions of this Court. “31. The rule of parity is the equal treatment of equals in equal circumstances. The rule of differentiation is enacting laws differentiating between different persons or things in different circumstances. The circumstances which govern one set of persons or objects may not necessarily be the same as those governing another set of persons or objects so that the question of unequal treatment does not really arise between persons governed by different conditions and different sets of circumstances. The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or circumstances in the same position and the varying needs of different classes of persons require special treatment. The legislature understands and appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds. The rule of classification is not a natural and logical corollary of the rule of equality, but the rule of differentiation is inherent in the concept of equality. Equality means parity of treatment under parity of conditions. Equality does not connote absolute equality. A classification in order to be constitutional must rest upon distinctions that are substantial and not merely illusory. The test is whether it has a reasonable basis free from artificiality and arbitrariness embracing all and omitting none naturally falling into that category.” 34.     The learned Additional Solicitor General has also referred to the decision in (2001) 2 SCC 259 K. Thimmappa Vs. Chairman, Central Board of Directors to contend that when a law is challenged to be discriminatory essentially on the ground that it denies equal treatment or protection, the question for determination by the Court is not whether it has resulted in inequality but whether there is some differentia which bears a just and reasonable relation to the object of Legislation. Mere differentiation does not per se amount to discrimination within the inhibition of the equal protection 35.     Having noted the above, at the outset, insofar as the decision relied on by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in the case of Navtej Singh Johar & Ors. (supra), though the Doctrine of Progressive Realisation of Rights is referred and has been stated that there must not be any regression of rights and in a progressive and an everimproving society there is no place for retreat, the society has to march ahead that the state should not take measures or steps that deliberately lead to retrogression on the enjoyment of rights either under the constitution or otherwise, we are of the opinion that the said observation would depend on the nature of the rights regarding which a consideration is made in appropriate cases. In the instant facts, the said observation cannot be of any assistance to the petitioners since the right though had been conferred earlier, such rights, insofar as the petitioners are concerned only a statutory right as they are admittedly not citizens of this country. Though certain rights under the statute were given, the state has a duty to balance the interests of its citizens and the non-citizens when a change is required to be made. However as to whether such consideration has been made in a just and proper manner with reference to all aspects is another aspect which we will advert to in the course of this judgment, but to contend that it amounts to retrogression may not arise in the present context. 36.    Insofar as the remaining decisions relied on by the petitioners as also the learned Additional Solicitor General, a cumulative perusal of the same would indicate that though this court has asserted with regard to the legitimate expectation, right not to be discriminated keeping in view Article 14 of the Constitution etc., they are all essentially in the context while dealing with the rights of a citizen against the State or in a situation where a dispute was between a citizen against another citizen of this country and in that regard when the constitutional principles were invoked. Further, the decisions relied on by the learned Additional Solicitor General would indicate that this Court while considering the right claimed by a foreigner or who is not a citizen of this country has dealt with the matter differently and declined to interfere and grant any relief. If in that light, the matter is looked into, when there is no dispute to the fact that the petitioners answer the definition of “foreigners” as defined under the Foreigners Act, the said decisions relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner would not apply on all fours. But keeping in view the nature of right claimed by the petitioners as OCI Cardholders which is a status accorded despite being foreigners and the background circumstance which led to the situation the spirit of the principles laid will have to be borne in mind while making further consideration since the principles laid down therein disapproving non-application of mind, arbitrariness etc. will hold good in the present circumstance as well. In the instant facts the statutory as OCI Cardholder subsists and it is in that light the validity of notification is to be tested which certainly can be raised by the petitioner and be addressed by this Court. 37.    Therefore, with the said understanding on the aspect of the applicability of the said decisions concluded as above, in the facts and circumstances arising in the instant case and the issue which is to be taken note and answered by us, the matter requires further consideration. No doubt, as pointed out by the learned Additional Solicitor General, Section 2(a) of the Foreigners Act, 1946 defines a ‘foreigner’ to mean a person who is not a citizen of India. If the matter had rested at that, there was no difficulty. In the instant case, there is a different dimension which arises for consideration. The circumstance in which the petitioners have come to be classified as ‘foreigners’ and the right which was conferred on them is to be kept in view. 38.    To put the matter in perspective and understand the concept based on which the rights are being claimed by the petitioners, it is necessary to advert to the fact situation and the law governing them despite being classified as ‘foreigner’. Most of the petitioners are all persons who are either of full age or are yet to reach the full age but are all children, whose both parents or one of them are Indian citizens. In the changing world and in an era where the concept of multinationals providing employment to Indian citizens had increased, the incident of birth of the children taking place in a country outside India had also increased. In that circumstance, successive governments had to bestow their attention to this aspect of the matter to provide better rights to such persons, who, though in the technical sense where ‘foreigners’, not being citizens of this country, yet had a ‘connect’ with this country. These were cases where though the umbilical cord with the biological mother had snapped in a foreign country, the umbilical connections with the country continue to remain intact as the entire family including the grandparents would be in India and the parents were Indian citizens in most cases. In that view, having considered all these aspects of the matter, despite such persons not having the benefit of citizenship as provided under Part II of the Constitution through Articles 5 to 8 thereof and there being no scope for dual citizenship, certain rights were created under Act, 1955 which had come into force based on the provision in Article 11 of the Constitution of India. 39.    In that regard, in a concept where the ‘dual citizenship’ was not recognised, such persons as like that of the petitioners were considered as Overseas Citizens of India card holders as defined under Section 2(ee) of Act, 1955. The Act, 1955 through the amendment Act 6 of 2004 brought certain rights and through substitution of Section 7 A to 7D the manner of registration of Overseas Citizen of India card holder; renunciation of citizenship and cancellation of registration were provided for. In the cases, on hand, the fact that all the petitioners are registered as Overseas Citizens of India cardholders is not in dispute. The right to which they are making a claim is conferred under Section 7B(1) to Act, 1955 which has been extracted and noted above. The right to education which was conferred under the notification dated 11.04.2005, in parity with the Non-Resident Indians is due to the fact that the NonResident Indians which is a separate class, had such right similar to that of the Indian citizens in matters relating to education. It is based on such right being conferred as far back as in the year 2005, the OCI Cardholders were taking part in the process of selections conducted for undertaking educational courses in India. Such benefit was extended to appear for the All India Pre-Medical Test or such other tests to make them eligible for admission in pursuance of the provisions contained in the relevant acts, through the notification dated 05.01.2009. The said benefit is being enjoyed by all the OCI Cardholders in the same manner as the Non-Resident Indians were enjoying along with the Indian citizens. In that circumstance, most of such OCI Cardholders have been pursuing their entire educational career in India. 40.    In the said background it is necessary to note that as per the information furnished relating to the status of the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.891 of 2021 which is taken as an instance for demonstrating the situation of their affinity with India and the number of years they have been in India. The details are as provided in Annexure P/2 41.     The above extracted details would indicate that in all the cases the petitioners have studied for more than six years in India and in most of the cases, almost the entire educational career up to the stage of the qualifying examination for the Pre- Medical Test has been undertaken in India. Apart from the specific cases noted herein, there are also petitioners/persons who had become citizens of a foreign country for compelling reasons, but hold benefit of OCI card. This would demonstrate that though in terms of law, the petitioners were ‘foreigners’ due to the incident of birth in a foreign country or such other compelling circumstances, they continue to remain in India and to pursue their education and had fully justified the mid-path benefit given to them based on the OCI card. The manner in which they have conducted themselves by being students in India would indicate that in addition to having the umbilical connection with the country, they being aware of the right conferred through the notifications dated 11.04.2005 and 05.01.2009 had positioned themselves to further their professional career by making a choice of their profession and undertaking the preparation for the same. This was based on what was held out to that class of Overseas Citizens. In fact, their entire educational career has been of the same standard, with the same ‘advantages’ and ‘disadvantages’ as has been the case with the students who are Indian citizens. In such situation, though in the strict term of the word ‘legitimate expectation’, it may not fall, a statutory right conferred had sown the seed of hope recognising the affiliation to this country, though they were not citizens in the strict sense. 42.     Hence keeping this situation in the backdrop, the manner in which the impugned notification would affect the petitioners and the similarly placed citizens will have to be taken note to examine whether the withdrawal of the conferred right will be justified. It is no doubt true as contended by the learned Additional Solicitor General, the right available to the OCI Cardholders is only the statutory right based on the right that is conferred through a notification in terms of Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955. Subsection (2) thereto specifically indicates the right that cannot be conferred even under sub-section (1) through a notification. Though a notification issued under the subdelegated power can be withdrawn, modified or altered, the effect of the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 needs to be noted to consider as to whether the same is wholly justified or as to whether any portion of it falls foul of the object for which it is made and the manner in which it has been modified. 43.     To the extent as noticed, the right being conferred under Section 7B(1) of Act 1955 through the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 if it was for the first time conferring such right, the petitioners could not have made any grievance. In fact, a perusal of the notification at first blush gives an impression that merely the earlier notifications dated 11.04.2005, 05.01.2007 and 05.01.2009 have been consolidated to crystallize all the rights to be provided under one notification. However, a closer perusal of the said notification which has been extracted above in the course of this judgment would indicate that clause 4(ii) of the notification though provides the right to appear for the All India Entrance Test, which was hitherto available to make them eligible for admission in parity with NonResident Indians has now restricted the eligibility for admission only against the seats which are reserved for Non-Resident Indians. In a situation where there is a certain marked economic difference between OCI Cardholders and Non-Resident Indians to acquire such seats, the OCI Cardholders claim to be at a disadvantage and the right which was available to them earlier has stood altered to their detriment. Even if that be so, if the said right which is conferred in modification of the right which had been bestowed earlier was made with prospective effect, certainly the petitioners and the similarly placed persons based on the contentions which are at present urged herein could not have been heard to complain in a proceeding of this nature and would have been a matter to be considered by the executive based on the claim of the Indian diaspora. 44.    However, what is necessary to be taken note is that the right which was bestowed through the notification dated 11.04.2005 and 05.01.2009 insofar as the educational parity, including in the matter of appearing for the All India Pre-Medical Test or such other tests to make them eligible for admission has been completely altered. Though the notification ex facie may not specify retrospective application, the effect of superseding the earlier notifications and the proviso introduced to clause 4(ii) would make the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 ‘retroactive’ insofar as taking away the assured right based on which the petitioners and similarly placed persons have altered their position and have adjusted the life’s trajectory with the hope of furthering their career in professional education. 45.    The learned senior counsel for the petitioners would in that context contend that since sub-section (2) to Section 7B of Act, 1955 does not exclude the right under Article 14 of the Constitution, it is available to be invoked and such discrimination contemplated in the notification to exclude the OCI Cardholders should be struck down. Article 14 of the Constitution can be invoked and contend discrimination only when persons similarly placed are treated differently and in that view the OCI Cardholders being a class by themselves cannot claim parity with the Indian citizens, except for making an attempt to save the limited statutory right bestowed. To that extent certainly the fairness in the procedure adopted has a nexus with the object for which change is made and the application of mind by the Respondent No.1, before issuing the impugned notification requires examination. 46.    As noted, the right of the OCI Cardholders is a midway right in the absence of dual citizenship. When a statutory right was conferred and such right is being withdrawn through a notification, the process for withdrawal is required to demonstrate that the action taken is reasonable and has nexus to the purpose. It should not be arbitrary, without basis and exercise of such power cannot be exercised unmindful of consequences merely because it is a sovereign power. To examine this aspect, in addition to the contentions urged by the learned Additional Solicitor General we have also taken note of the objection statement filed with the writ petition. Though detailed contentions are urged with regard to the status of a citizen and the sovereign power of the State, as already noted, in these petitions the sovereign power has not been questioned but the manner in which it is exercised in the present circumstance is objected. The contention of learned Additional Solicitor General is that the intention from the beginning was to grant parity to OCI Cardholders only with NRIs. On that aspect as already noted above we have seen the nature of the benefit that had been extended to the petitioners and the similarly placed petitioners under the notifications of the year 2005, 2007 and 2009. The further contention insofar as equating the OCI Cardholders to compete only for the seats which are reserved for NRIs and to exclude the OCI Cardholders for admission against any seat reserved exclusively for the Indian citizens, across the board, even to the persons who were bestowed the right earlier, it is stated that the rationale is to protect the rights of the Indian citizens in such matters where State may give preference to its citizens vis-à-vis foreigners holding OCI Cards. It is further averred in the counter that number of seats available for medical and engineering courses in India are very limited and that it does not fully cater to the requirement of even the Indian citizens. It is therefore contended that the right to admission to such seats should primarily be available to the Indian citizens instead of foreigners, including OCI Cardholders. 47.     Except for the bare statement in the objection statement, there is no material with regard to the actual exercise undertaken to arrive at a conclusion that the participation of OCI Cardholders in the selection process has denied the opportunity of professional education to the Indian citizens. There are no details made available about the consideration made as to, over the years how many OCI cardholders have succeeded in getting a seat after competing in the selection process by which there was denial of seats to Indian Citizens though they were similar merit-wise. Per contra, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on the statement made by the Hon’ble Minister in reply to the question raised in the Rajya Sabha as recent as on 13.12.2022, and an extract to indicate the details is produced along with I.A. No.4763 of 2023 for additional documents in W.P.(C) No.246 of 2022. The details (a) to (c) As per information received from National Testing Agency (NTA), the details of number of students who appeared for the NEET-UG examination in the last three The details of number of Undergraduate (UG)/Postgraduate (PG) seats available during the admission process of last three years are as under:- According to National Medical Commission (NMC), the number of MBBS & PG seats vacant from 2018-19 to 2021-22, year wise is as under:- 48.    Hence, it is sought to be pointed out on behalf of the petitioners that the explanation put forth does not indicate the true State of Affairs in as much as, seats have still remained vacant in the previous years. It is no doubt true that as contended by the learned Additional Solicitor General, the vacancies will remain due to several factors such as reservation of seats, other permutations and combinations as also the preferred and non-preferred colleges. Be that as it may, the dire need to take away the bestowed right by applying the impugned notification even to young students who technically though are not citizens of this country but were provided certain rights in such manner would not be justified as it does not demonstrate nexus to the object sought to be achieved. Policy decision for the future, certainly is within the domain of Respondent No.1 based on the sovereign powers of the State. Even on that aspect all that has been stated is that the decision to issue the notification was taken in the meeting of Secretaries held on 19.07.2018 without indicating the nature of deliberations. Therefore, in that perspective, keeping in view the present position, the decision to supersede the earlier notifications and take away the right of OCI Cardholders in whose favour such right had accrued and they have acted in a manner to take benefit of such right should not have been nullified without reference to the consequences. Having undertaken the entire educational career in India or at least the High School onwards, they cannot at this stage turn back to the country in which they were born to secure the professional education as they would not be in a position to compete with the students there either, keeping in view the study pattern and the monetary implication. 49.    To put the matter in its context for better appreciation of the mischief caused by the impugned notification and the manner in which it would irreversibly alter the situation, to which aspect there is non-application of mind by respondent No.1, it would be appropriate to refer to the existing facts of an individual petitioner. To demonstrate this aspect we shall take the details of the first petitioner in W.P.(C) No.891 of 2021 as an instance to demonstrate the case in point. From the tabular statement supra, it (a)    She was born on 31.12.2003 in California, USA. (g)    Passed the 12th standard which is the qualifying examination to appear for the Medical Entrance also in India. As on the year of birth in 2003 the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2003 was brought in to introduce Section 7A of Act, 1955 w.e.f. 06.12.2004. The said amendment was based on the recommendations of a High-Level Committee on Indian diaspora. The Government of India decided to register the Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) of a certain category as specified in Section 7A of Act, 1955 as Overseas Citizens of India. The OCI scheme was introduced with the issue of notification of 2005 which is in the background of the demands for dual citizenship by the Indian diaspora and the concept of dual citizenship is not recognized. 50.    Therefore it is evident that the object of providing the right in the year 2005 for issue of OCI cards was in response to the demand for dual citizenship and as such, as an alternative to dual citizenship which was not recognised, the OCI card benefit was extended. If in that light, the details of the first petitioner taken note hereinabove is analysed in that context, though the option of getting the petitioner No.1 registered as a citizen under Section 4 of Act, 1955 by seeking citizenship by descent soon after her birth or even by registration of the citizenship as provided under Section 5 of Act, 1955, was available in the instant facts to her parents, when immediately after the birth of petitioner No.1 the provision for issue of OCI cards was statutorily recognised and under the notification the right to education was also provided, the need for parents of petitioner No.1 to make a choice to acquire the citizenship by descent or to renounce the citizenship of the foreign country and seek registration of the Citizenship of India did not arise to be made, since as an alternative to dual citizenship the benefit had been granted and was available to petitioner No.1 and the entire future was planned on that basis and that situation continued till the year 2021. 51.    Further, as on the year 2021 when the impugned notification was issued the petitioner No.1 was just about 18 years i.e., full age and even if at that stage, the petitioner was to renounce and seek for citizenship of India as provided under Section 5(1)(f)(g), the duration for such process would disentitle her the benefit of the entire education course from pre-school stage pursued by her in India and the benefit for appearing for the Pre-Medical Test which was available to her will be erased in one stroke. Neither would she get any special benefit in the country where she was born. Therefore in that circumstance when there was an assurance from a sovereign State to persons like that of the petitioner No.1 in view of the right provided through the notification issued under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 and all ‘things were done’ by such Overseas Citizens of India to take benefit of it and when it was the stage of maturing into the benefit of competing for the seat, all ‘such things done’ should not have been undone and nullified with the issue of the impugned notification by superseding the earlier notifications so as to take away even the benefit that was held out to them. 52.    Therefore, on the face of it the impugned notification not saving such accrued rights would indicate non application of mind and arbitrariness in the action. Further in such circumstance when the stated object was to make available more seats for the Indian Citizens and it is demonstrated that seats have remained vacant, the object for which such notification was issued even without saving the rights and excluding the petitioners and similarly placed OCI Cardholders with the other students is to be classified as one without nexus to the object. As taken note earlier during the course this order, the right which was granted to the OCI cardholders in parity with the NRIs was to appear for the Pre-Medical Entrance Test along with all other similar candidates i.e. the Indian citizens. In a situation where it has been demonstrated that the petitioner No.1 being born in the year 2003, has been residing in India since 2006 and has received her education in India, such student who has pursued her education by having the same ‘advantages’ and ‘disadvantages’ like that of any other students who is a citizen of India, the participation in the Pre-Medical Entrance Test or such other Entrance Examination would be on an even keel and there is no greater advantage to the petitioner No.1 merely because she was born in California, USA. Therefore, the right which had been conferred and existed had not affected Indian citizens so as to abruptly deny all such rights. The right was only to compete. It could have been regulated for the future, if it is the policy of the Sovereign State. No thought having gone into all these aspects is crystal clear from the manner in which it has been 53.    In the above circumstance, keeping in view, the object with which the Act, 1955 was amended so as to provide the benefit to Overseas Citizen of India and in that context when rights were given to the OCI cardholders through the notifications issued from time to time, based on which the OCI cardholders had adopted to the same and had done things so as to position themselves for the future, the right which had accrued in such process could not have been taken away in the present manner, which would act as a ‘retroactive’ notification. Therefore, though the notification ex- facie does not specify retrospective operation, since it retroactively destroys the rights which were available, it is to be ensured that such of those beneficiaries of the right should not be affected by such notification. Though the rule against retrospective construction is not applicable to statutes merely because a part of the requisite for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing, in the instant case the rights were conferred under the notification and such rights are being affected by subsequent notification, which is detrimental and the same should be avoided to that extent and be allowed to operate without such retroactivity. 54.    We note that it is not retrospective inasmuch as it does not affect the OCI Cardholders who have participated in the selection process, have secured a seat and are either undergoing or completed the MBBS course or such other professional course. However, it will act as retroactive action to deny the right to persons who had such right which is not sustainable to that extent. The goal post is shifted when the game is about to be over. Hence we are of the view that the retroactive operation resulting in retrospective consequences should be set aside and such adverse consequences is to be avoided. 55.    Therefore in the factual background of the issue involved, to sum up, it will have to be held that though the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 is based on a policy and in the exercise of the statutory power of a Sovereign State, the provisions as contained therein shall apply prospectively only to persons who are born in a foreign country subsequent to 04.03.2021 i.e. the date of the notification and who seek for a registration as OCI cardholder from that date since at that juncture the parents would have a choice to either seek for citizenship by descent or to continue as a foreigner in the background of the subsisting policy of the Sovereign State. 56.    In light of the above, it is held that the respondent No.1 in furtherance of the policy of the Sovereign State has the power to pass appropriate notifications as contemplated under Section 7B(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, to confer or alter the rights as provided for therein. However, when a conferred right is withdrawn, modified or altered, the process leading thereto should demonstrate application of mind, nexus to the object of such withdrawal or modification and any such decision should be free of arbitrariness. In that background, the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 though competent under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955 suffers from the vice of non- application of mind and despite being prospective, is in fact ‘retroactive’ taking away the rights which were conferred also as a matter of policy of the Sovereign State. 57.    Hence, the notification being sustainable prospectively, we hereby declare that the impugned portion of the notification which provides for supersession of the notifications dated 11.04.2005, 05.01.2007 and 05.01.2009 and the clause 4(ii), its proviso and Explanation (1) thereto shall operate prospectively in respect of OCI cardholders who have secured the same subsequent to 04.03.2021. 58.    We further hold that the petitioners in all these cases and all other similarly placed OCI cardholders will be entitled to the rights and privileges which had been conferred on them earlier to the notification dated 04.03.2021 and could be availed by them notwithstanding the exclusion carved out in the notification dated 04.03.2021. The participation of the petitioners and similarly placed OCI cardholders in the selection process and the subsequent action based on the interim orders passed herein or elsewhere shall stand regularised. 59.    Notwithstanding the fact that we have held the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 to be valid with specific prospective effect in view of the power available to respondent No.1 under Section 7B(1) of Act, 1955, keeping in perspective the wide ramification it may have in future also on the Indian diaspora and since it is claimed to be based on the policy decision of the Sovereign State, we expect that the same would be examined in the higher echelons of the Executive with reference to the rights already created. 60.    In terms of the above, all these petitions/ appeals are allowed in part to the above extent with no order as to costs.
Counsel for Petitioner :- Syed Mehfuzur Rehman,Vikas Counsel for Respondent :- G.A. Heard Shri Vikas Vikram Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner and Smt. Meera Tripathi, learned A.G.A. for the State/respondent nos.1, 2 and perused the impugned F.I.R. as well as material brought on record. The instant writ petition has been filed by the petitioner- Mrs. Umme Kulsum, seeking following reliefs: "(i) issue a writ order or direction in the nature of certiorari for quashing the impugned order dated 10.08.2021 passed by the Police Commissioner, Lucknow/opposite party no.2, as contained in Annexure No.1 to this writ petition, after summoning the original form the opposite party no.2. (ii) issue a writ order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the opposite parties not to give effect to the impugned order dated 10.08.2021, as contained in Annexure no.1 to the writ petition." It has been argued by learned counsel for petitioner that the petitioner is the complainant of the present case and she had lodged an Case Crime/F.I.R. No.176 of 2021, under Sections 498-A, 323, 506, 507, 384 I.P.C., Sections 3, 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and Sections 3, 5(1) of U.P. Prohibition of Indira Nagar, District Lucknow against accused respondent nos.3 and 4, a copy of the same is annexed as Annexure No.3 to the writ petition. He further submits that respondent no.2/Police Commissioner, U.P., Lucknow had transferred the investigation of the present case to Commissioner of Police, Banglore City, Karnataka by impugned order dated 10.08.2021, a copy of the same is annexed as Annexure No.1 to the writ petition. He further submits that the impugned order dated 10.08.2021 is liable to be quashed on the ground that it is a matrimonial dispute and simply because some part of the incident has taken place at Banglore, cannot be a ground for transfer of the investigation to another place as the offence under Section 498- A I.P.C. is a continuing offence. Since Smt. Meera Tripathi, learned A.G.A. has put in appearance on behalf of respondents no. 1, 2, hence no fresh notices need to be issued to them. Issue notice to accused-respondent nos. 3 and 4. Steps be taken within ten days. Learned A.G.A. prays for and is allowed two weeks' time to file a counter affidavit in the matter. Let the matter be listed on 27.09.2021. Till the next date of listing, effect and operation of impugned order dated 10.08.2021 passed by respondent no.2/Police Commissioner, U.P., Lucknow shall remain stayed.
1. The Petitioner, who is an Additional Director General (Electrical & Mechanical) [„ADG (E&M)] in the Central Public Works Department („CPWD‟), has filed the present petition challenging the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal („CAT‟) dated 22nd November, 2018 in OA No.2350/ 2018, filed by the Petitioner. Respondent No. 1 is the Union of India through the Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Respondent No.2 is the Director General, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and Respondent No. 3 is the Union Public Services Commission („UPSC‟). 2. By the above impugned order, the CAT rejected the Petitioner‟s prayer for setting aside the decision of the Departmental Promotion Committee („DPC‟) dated 4th December, 2017, whereby the Petitioner was declared „unfit‟ for promotion to the post of Special Director General (Electricity & Mechanical) 3. The background facts are that the Petitioner joined as an Assistant Executive Engineer (E&M) in 1983. He was able to secure timely promotions, and in 2012, got promoted as Chief Engineer. On 6th August, 2014 the Petitioner was communicated his Annual Performance Appraisal Report („APAR‟) for the period between 13th June, 2013 and 31st March, 2014. In the APAR for the said period, the Petitioner was given zero points against Column No. 3.1 (ii) and a grading of 5.63 by the Reviewing Authority („RA‟). The Reporting Officer („RO‟), on the other hand, gave the Petitioner 7 points in the aforementioned column and awarded him a grading of 7. The Accepting Authority („AA‟) gave the Petitioner a grading of 5 points. Based on the said grade points the Petitioner was awarded an overall grading of „Good‟, which was a below benchmark grading. 4. Aggrieved by the above grading, the Petitioner submitted a representation dated 14th August, 2014 to the Deputy Director (Admn-II), Director General, CPWD. By an order dated 13th February, 2015, the Minister of Urban Development, who was the Competent Authority („CA‟), upgraded the Petitioner‟s APAR to „Very Good‟ by awarding him 6.57 grade points. 5. In its meeting on 18th December, 2015, the DPC considered officers for promotion to the post of ADG (E&M) and the Petitioner‟s name was recommended. Based on the DPC‟s recommendation, an Office Order dated 1 st April, 2016 was issued promoting the Petitioner to the post of ADG (E&M). 6. In the DPC meeting convened on 4th December, 2017, the Petitioner‟s case for promotion to the post of SDG (E&M) against the vacancy year 2018, was considered. The DPC found the Petitioner to be „unfit‟ for promotion to the “While examining the APAR for the year-2013-14 (from 13.06.2013 to 31.03;2014) the Committee noted that the Reporting Officer has given 7,00 numerical grading and the Reviewing Officer has given final, grading 5.63, while the Accepting Authority has given 5.00 numerical grading. The Committee also went through the letter-dated 13.02.2015 by which the grade- point has been raised to 6.57 by the Competent Authority. The remarks or attributes recorded in various columns of the APAR also do not commensurate with the overall grading. The Committee, therefore, took a conscious decision to grade the officer for the year 2013-14 as “Good” only. Based on this, the Committee assessed Shri Avtar Singh Arora as unfit for promotion to the post of Special Director General (Electrical & Mechanical) in the Central Public Works Department, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs for the vacancy year 2018.” 7. Aggrieved by the above decision reached by the DPC in its meeting on 4 th December 2017, the Petitioner submitted a representation to the Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs urging that a Review DPC be conducted to revise his APAR to „Very Good‟, and consider his case for promotion to SDG (E&M). 8. On 31st May, 2018 the Petitioner filed an RTI under the Right to Information Act, 2005 enquiring about the decision in connection with the aforesaid representation. In a response dated 1st June, 2018, the Petitioner received the office notings in relation to his representation. It is stated that ultimately the Petitioner‟s representation came to be rejected. He then filed O.A. No. 2350/ 2018 before the CAT challenging the minutes of the DPC convened on 4 th 9. The stand taken by the Petitioner before the CAT is identical to his averments in the present writ petition. The Respondents filed short counter- affidavits in response to the Petitioner‟s O.A., placing reliance on OMs issued by the DoPT dated 10th April, 1989 and 9th May, 2014 in respect of the functioning of DPCs to contend that DPCs enjoyed full discretion to arrive at a determination of a candidate‟s suitability for promotion to a higher post. Respondent No. 3 also sought to contend the reliance by the Petitioner on the decision of the Supreme Court in Abhijeet Ghosh Dastidar v. Union of India and Ors. (2009) 16 SCC 146, was misplaced since the APAR for 2013 - 14 had been duly communicated to the Petitioner. The rejoinder filed by the Petitioner herein largely reiterated his stand in the O.A. 10. The said impugned order of the CAT placed reliance on paragraph 5 of the OM dated 9th May, 2014 issued by the DoPT. In dismissing the O.A. filed by “9. In this regard, it needs to be observed that the higher the level of the post under consideration by the DPC, the closer would be the scrutiny of the APARs. The persons to be selected to hold the posts at higher level are required to be of high accomplishments, and unstinted integrity. Seniority and average performance alone will not do. The instructions are to the effect that even where the APARs are consistently 'Very Good' for the period in question, the other attributes of the Officer, having a bearing on his suitability to the post, need to be examined. The scrutiny is required to be much more where the APAR of any year for the period in question has been upgraded by the competent authority.” 11. After noting that it was not necessary for the CAT to refer to the details of the evaluation made by the DPC, the CAT observed that both the RA and the AA had “furnished cogent reasons in support of their conclusions”, in contrast to the failure of the RO “to present a pen picture of the officer under consideration” as per the instructions noted in the proforma document of the APAR. The CAT also held that the judgments of this Court dated 4 th August, 2014 in W.P.(C) 7423/2013 (Govt. of NCT of Delhi v. Rakesh Beniwal) and 22nd August, 2016 in W.P.(C) 1050/2015 (Union of India v. Amiya Kumar Jena) did not apply to the instant case. 12. On 5th December, 2018, when this petition was first listed, the Court passed “1. The petitioner has preferred the present writ petition to assail the order dated 02.11.2018 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) in OA No. 2350/2018. 2. The Tribunal had rejected the said OA of the petitioner wherein, the petitioner assailed his non-selection as Special Director General (E&M) in CPWD. For the said post, DPC was held on 04.12.2017. The rejection of the petitioner‟s candidature was on account of DPC finding that the upgradation of the APAR of the petitioner for the year 2013-14 by the competent authority i.e. Hon‟ble Minister was not justified and on the basis of the record, the said upgradation from “Good” to “Very Good” was not made out. The minutes of the DPC in so far as they are relevant are as “7. Attention of the Committee was also invited to the instructions contained in DOP&T O.M. No. 35034/97- Estt(D) dated 08.02.2002, which provide inter-alia that assessed for promotion with reference to the prescribed benchmark and accordingly grade the officers as “Fit” or “Unfit”. Only those who are graded “Fit” (i.e. who meet the prescribed benchmark) by the DPC shall be included and arranged in the select panel in order of their inter-se seniority in the feeder grade. Those prescribed benchmark) by the DPC shall not be included in the select panel. Thus, there shall be no supersession in promotion among those who are graded “Fit” (in terms of the prescribed benchmark) by the DPC. (from 13.06.2013 to 31.03.2014) the Committee noted that the Reporting Officer has given 7.00 numerical grading and the Reviewing Officer has given final grading 5.63, while the Accepting Authority has given 5.00 numerical grading. The Committee also went through the letter dated 13.02.2015 by which the grade justifiable reasons for upgrading the said APAR has been specified. The office records also do not present any acceptable reasons warranting to assert the upgradation made by the Competent Authority. The remarks / attributes recorded in various columns of the grading. The Committee, therefore, took a conscious decision to grade the officer for the year 2013-14 as “Good” only. Based on this, the Committee assessed Shri Avtar Singh Arora as „Unfit‟ for promotion to the Mechanical) in the Central Public Works Department, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs for the vacancy year 2018.” 3. The submission of Mr. Bhardwaj, firstly, is that the petitioner was promoted to the post of Addl. Director General in the year 2015 by the same DPC. The constitution of the DPC qua consideration of promotion to the post of Addl. Director General and Special Director General is the same namely, the Chairman or Member, UPSC, who acts as Chairman; Secretary, Ministry of Housing & Urban Development Affairs, who acts as Member; and, Director General, CPWD, who acts as second Member. The submission of Mr. Bhardwaj is that the case of the petitioner was considered by the same DPC for promotion to the post of Addl. Director General and the said DPC did not raise any issue with regard to the upgradation of the petitioner‟s APAR for the year 2013-14 (June, 3014 to March, 2014) by the competent authority from “Good” to “Very Good” on the basis of his representation. His submission is that the same DPC could not have taken a different view while considering his promotion to the post of 4. In so far as this submission is concerned, we do not find any merit in the same. Consideration by the DPC of the petitioner‟s case for promotion to the post of Spl. Director General was a fresh consideration. If this submission of the petitioner was to be accepted, there was no need to hold a fresh DPC and, merely, the ACRs for the period after the petitioner became the Addl. Director General need have been considered. However, that is not the position. The entire service record of the petitioner and other candidates was required to be considered by the DPC and was, accordingly, considered. Moreover, the present consideration by the DPC was for a still higher post, namely, Spl. Director General and therefore, the DPC was entitled to have a fresh look into the matter. There is no question of binding the present DPC with its view taken earlier, inter alia, in respect of ACR for the period 5. The next submission of Mr. Bhardwaj is that in terms of OM dated 09.05.2014, it was imperative for the DPC to consider the entire record, including the representation made by the petitioner for upgradation of his APAR for the year 2013-14. 6. In the present case, for the relevant period i.e. June, 2013 to March, 2014, the petitioner had been assessed as “7” on a scale of 1 to 10 by the reporting officer in respect of the attribute namely “extent of accomplishment of planned work”, “accomplishment of other additional assignment/initiative undertaken”, “quality of work output” and “overall grading of work output”. The reviewing authority had however, assessed the petitioner at “0” in respect of “accomplishment of other additional assignment/initiative undertake”; “Quality of work output” was assed at “6”; and, “overall grading of work output” was assed at “4.33”. The accepting authority had accepted the assessment made by the reviewing authority and consequently, the petitioner was graded as “Good” even though, the reporting officer had assessed him as “Very Good”. The petitioner had made his representation and on the said representation, the comments of the reporting authority, reviewing authority and accepting authority were also called for. Eventually, it appears that the case was put up before the competent authority i.e. Hon‟ble Minister of Housing & Urban Development Affairs at the relevant time and his noting while the accepting the representation of the petitioner reads, as follows: “I have gone through the representation submitted by c) There are three Chief Engineer level officers at Training institute i.e. CE (Civil), CE (Elect) and assigned the additional work of “Administration” to any of the 3 officers. This work was in addition domain area. Keeping above in mind, the plea of the officer that he took additional responsibility is allowed and his grade point is raised to 6.57” 7. The DPC has, however, recorded in its minutes that the committee went through the letter dated 13.02.2015, which was written by the Hon‟ble Minister accepting the representation of the petitioner and his grading was raised to “6.57”. The DPC has observed that it found no valid reasons for upgrading the APAR. It also observed that initial records also do not present any acceptable reason warranting the upgradation made by the Competent Authority and that, remarks/attributes recorded in various columns of APAR were also not commensurate with the overall grading. The committee took the conscious decision to grade the petitioner for the year 2013-14 “Good” only. Consequently, the petitioner was found to be unfit for the post of Spl. Director General (C&M) in CPWD by the DPC. 8. In the light of the procedure laid down in OM dated 09.03.2018, it was obligatory for the DPC to make assessment based on the entries in APAR and other material “including the representation of the Govt. servant”. 9. The only aspect, which in our view, needs consideration is whether the representation of the petitioner and the response of the reporting officer, reviewing officer and the accepting officer were placed before the DPC, when it arrived at its decision to find the petitioner unfit. Limited to this aspect, issue notice. Mr. Bhardwaj accepts notice on behalf of respondent nos. 1 and 2. Mr. Kaushik accepts notice on behalf of respondent no.3. 10. The respondents shall file a short affidavit on the aforesaid aspect within one week, specifically disclosing whether the representation of the petitioner for upgradation of his APAR for the year 2013-14 along with the comments of the reporting officer, reviewing officer and accepting officer were placed before DPC. The said affidavit shall be filed by the respondent nos. 1 and 2 along with the relevant record/communications. Mr. Bhardwaj shall provide a complete paper book to the learned counsel for the respondents during the course of the day. 11. List on 18th December, 2018. 12. Any promotion made shall be subject to further orders by this 13. By order dated 4th November, 2019 the interim order comprised in the order dated 5th December, 2018 reproduced hereinabove was made absolute during the pendency of the writ petition. 14. The Respondents have filed a compliance affidavit in pursuance of the order dated 5th December, 2018. The Court has perused the records annexed thereto. It would appear that while the material placed before the DPC did include the representation dated 14th August, 2014 made by the Petitioner to the DG, CPWD, by the Respondents‟ own admission at paragraph 8: “… comments of Reporting Officer, Reviewing Officer and Accepting officer were not placed before DPC separately, but the gist of comments of reporting and reviewing officers were mentioned …” 15. Moreover, the compliance affidavit states at paragraph 9 as under: “… comments of the Accepting authority were not sought as the Accepting authority had retired on reaching the age of superannuation when this case was being dealt with.” 16. Even a perusal of the aforesaid “gist of comments”, which have been extracted in the compliance affidavit of the Respondents, reveals that the said comments merely reiterate the stands taken by the RO and the RO in the APAR for the relevant time period. 17. At this juncture, the OM dated 9th May, 2014 of the DoPT must be taken note of. The said OM, at paragraph 5, notes as under: “5. It is reiterated that in discharge of its statutory functions the respective DPCs are required to determine the merits of those being considered for promotion with reference to the prescribed bench-mark, by making its own assessment, on the basis of the entries and gradings contained in the APARs and other relevant material facts placed before it, and accordingly grade the officers as 'fit' or 'unfit'. Relevant material would inter alia include the orders of the competent authority on the representation of the Government servant on the entries/ grading in APAR. In the event of the DPC deciding not to take cognisance of such an order, on the ground that the same is not a speaking order, the DPC shall make its assessment based on the entries in APAR and other material including the representation of the Government servant. The DPCs should substantiate its assessment by giving justifiable and sustainable reasons including the cases where the assessment of the DPC is different from the grading in APAR (original or amended after representation by the Government servant).” 18. It is on the basis of the said OM that this Court ordered notice to issue in the present petition on the limited question of whether the representation of the Petitioner for upgradation of APAR for the relevant period and the comments of the RO, RA, and AA had been considered by the DPC, as has been reproduced hereinabove. 19. As is evident for the discussion above, the said question must be answered in the negative. In Union of India v. S. P. Nayyar (2014) 14 SCC 370, the “12. It is settled that the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India cannot sit in appeal over the assessment made by the DPC. If the assessment made by the DPC is perverse or is not based on record or proper record has not been considered by the DPC, it is always open to the High Court Under Article 226 of the Constitution to remit the matter back to the DPC for recommendation, but the High Court cannot assess the merit on its own, on perusal of the service record of one or the other employee.” 20. As noted hereinbefore, the Respondents admit that the entire record, i.e. the comments of the RO, RA, and AA had not been made available to the DPC. Therefore, for this reason alone, the decision of the DPC dated 4 th December, 2017 is liable to be set aside. 21. Be that as it may, the said impugned decision of the DPC also falls afoul of paragraph 5 of the said OM dated 9th May, 2014 for failing to “substantiate its assessment by giving justifiable and sustainable reasons”, in view of the fact that it decided not to take into account the upgradation of the Petitioner‟s APAR for the relevant period. 22. On behalf of the UPSC reliance is placed on the decisions in Union Public Service Commission v. Hiranyalal Dev AIR 1988 SC 1069; U. P. S. C. v. K. Rajaiah (2005) 10 SCC 15 and Union Public Service Commission v. M. Sathiya Priya (2018) 15 SCC 796. It was urged that the DPC was not bound to record the reasons for its decision to downgrade the Petitioner to „good‟ for the 23. This Court has carefully examined each of the above decisions. The legal position as explained in U. P. S. C. v. K. Rajaiah (supra), is that “for good reasons, the Selection Committee can evolve its own classification which may be at variance with the gradation given in the ACRs.” The following passage “6. We cannot also endorse the view taken by the High Court that consistent with the principle of fair play, the Selection Committee ought to have recorded reasons while giving a lesser grading to the 1st respondent The High Court relied on the decision of this Court in National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences v. Dr. K. Kalyana Raman and Ors. Far from supporting the view taken by the High Court, the said decision laid down the proposition that the function of the Selection Committee being administrative in nature, it is under no obligation to record the reasons for its decision when there is no rule or regulation obligating the Selection Committee to record the reasons. This Court then observed "even the principles of natural justice do not require an administrative authority or a Selection Committee or an Examiner to record reasons for the selection or non selection of the person in the absence of statutory requirement. This principle has been stated by this Court in R.S. Das v. Union of India." In the next paragraph, the learned Judges indicated as to what is expected of the Selection Committee, in the following words: "...we may state at the outset that giving of reasons for decision is different from, and in principle distinct from the requirements of procedural fairness. The procedural fairness is the main requirement in the administrative action. The 'fairness' or 'fair procedure' in the administration action ought to be observed. The Selection Committee cannot be an exception to this principle. It must take a decision reasonably without being guided by extraneous or irrelevant consideration. But there is nothing on record to suggest that the Selection Committee did anything to the contrary..." 24. In Union Public Service Commission v. M. Sathiya Priya (supra), the above principles were reiterated and it was held that “the recommendations of the Selection Committee cannot be challenged except on the ground of mala fides or serious violation of the statutory rules.” 25. What emerges from the above decision is that while a Selection Committee need not record reasons as a broad principle, it is „desirable‟ that it does if it disagrees with the ACR grading. Further, if there is a statutory requirement that it should do so, then the Committee would be obliged to. Another important aspect is that it must act without malice and not be guided by „extraneous or irrelevant considerations.” As a corollary, material that was relevant for its decision also cannot be overlooked. 26. In the case in hand, the limited scope of enquiry by this Court was to examine if there was a departure from the procedure laid down in OM dated 9th May, 2014 which makes it obligatory for the DPC to make assessment based on the entries in APAR and other material “including the representation of the Govt. servant”. It specifically states that “the DPC should substantiate its assessment by giving justifiable and sustainable reasons including the cases where the assessment of the DPC is different from the grading in APAR (original or amended after representation by the Government servant).” 27. In its order dated 5th December 2018, this Court made it clear that “the only aspect, which in our view, needs consideration is whether the representation of the petitioner and the response of the reporting officer, reviewing officer and the accepting officer were placed before the DPC, when it arrived at its decision to find the petitioner unfit.” There has, as already noticed, a procedural departure on both counts. 28. It is seen from the order of the CA that there were clear reasons for the decision to upgrade the Petitioner‟s grading. Specifically, the Petitioner‟s plea in his representation dated 14th August, 2014 in relation to taking on additional responsibility was considered and it was noted as under: “There are three Chief Engineer level officers at Training Institute- i.e. CE (Civil), CE (Elect.), CA(Trg), ADG (Trg) could have assigned the additional work of “Administration” to any of the 3 officers. This work was in addition to the regular work of providing training in domain area. The competent authority has decided to allow the plea of the officer that he took additional responsibility. Accordingly, his grade point is raised to 6.57.” 29. The CA having recorded the above reason for increasing for Petitioner‟s grade points, it was incumbent upon the DPC to supply reasons for differing with it in this regard. 30. The third and important aspect of the matter is that the DPC which was to assess the suitability of the Petitioner for promotion as SDG took upon itself the task of rewriting his APAR grading for 2013-14, when the grading of „very good‟ given for that year had been acted upon and he had been promoted as ADG. It was not open to the DPC to downgrade the officer for the year 2013- 14 as “Good” only and on that basis assess the Petitioner as „Unfit‟ for promotion to the post of SDG (E&M) in the CPWD. While it was possible to the DPC to take a view on an overall assessment of the Petitioner, as per his APAR‟s as they existed, it was not within its domain at that stage to downgrade his APAR for a previous year which has already been acted upon and on that basis find him „unfit‟. This would amount to a suo-motu reviewing of a grading of a previous year on the basis of which the Petitioner had already been promoted as ADG. 31. In that view of the matter, the Court sets aside the impugned decision of the DPC, and the order of the CAT dismissing the Petitioner‟s O.A. The Court directs that a Review DPC be convened for consideration of the Petitioner for promotion as SDG (E&M) in the CPWD as on the date of the original DPC on the basis of the APARs as they stood on that date i.e. with no change to the Petitioner‟s grading for that year or any previous year. If the Petitioner is thereby found fit, he should be promoted as SDG with a notional back date of the promotion and fixation of pay but with no requirement of payment of arrears. This exercise be completed within a period of twelve weeks from today. If the Petitioner is aggrieved by any part of the consequential orders, it will be open to him to seek appropriate remedies in accordance with law. 32. The writ petition is allowed in the above terms, but in the circumstance, no order as to costs.
1.     Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Special Appeal No. 343 of 2021 by which the Division Bench of the High Court has dismissed the said appeal and has confirmed the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge directing the appellants – State of U.P. and Ors. to pay the gratuity to the original writ petitioner on the death of the deceased employee (her husband), the State of U.P. and Ors. have preferred the present appeal. 2.     The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under:- 2.1    That the deceased employee Dr. Vinod Kumar, husband of the original writ petitioner, was working as Lecturer. He joined service on 02.07.2001 and died on 11.08.2009 while in service. The original writ petitioner - wife of the deceased employee applied for payment of gratuity due to her husband, but the same was rejected on the ground that the husband of the petitioner, while in service, had not opted for retirement at the age of 60 years. The original writ petitioner therefore filed the writ appeal before the High Court being Writ Appeal No. 2211 of 2021. 2.2    Relying upon and following the earlier decisions of the High Court and by observing that if the deceased employee would have been alive, he would have retired in 2026, if he had opted for retirement at the age of 60 years and before he could opt for retirement at the age of 60 years, he died, therefore, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and directed the appellants to compute the amount payable to her husband towards gratuity quantified in accordance with the relevant Government orders with the interest @ 8% p.a. from the date of filing of the application for gratuity till the amount is actually disbursed, ignoring the fact that the husband of the original writ petitioner had not opted for retirement at the age of 60 years. 2.3    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge, the appellants preferred the writ appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. By the impugned judgment and order, the Division Bench of the High Court has dismissed the said appeal, hence the present appeal. 3.     Shri Sanjay Kumar Tyagi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has materially erred in directing the appellants to pay gratuity to the original writ petitioner on the death of the deceased employee. 3.1    It is submitted that the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that the deceased employee failed to exercise the option and therefore the benefit of death- cum-retirement gratuity cannot be sanctioned to the respondent being heirs of the deceased employee. 3.2    It is further submitted that as per the prevailing government orders, the exercise of option to retire at the age of 58 years (now 60 years) for availing the benefit of death-cum-retirement gratuity was a mandatory exercise. It is submitted that therefore in the absence of any option exercised by the deceased employee, the High Court has materially erred in directing the appellants to grant the benefit of death- cumretirement gratuity to the respondent on the death of the deceased employee. 4.     While opposing the present appeal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent – heirs of the deceased employee has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, no error has been committed by the High Court in granting the benefit of death-cum-retirement gratuity to the respondent on the death of the deceased employee. 4.1    It is submitted that the deceased was appointed as a Lecturer on 2.7.2001 and died while in service on 11.8.2009. It is submitted that before the deceased could exercise the option, unfortunately he died. It is submitted that as per the Government Order dated 16.09.2009, the deceased was entitled to exercise the option to retire at the age of 60 years which was available up to 01.07.2010, however, before he could exercise the option, unfortunately he died. It is submitted that therefore in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and taking note of the aforesaid facts, no error has been committed by the High Court in directing the appellants to grant the benefit of death-cum-retirement gratuity to the heirs of the deceased – respondent herein. It is submitted that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the grant of benevolent scheme of gratuity by the learned Single Judge of the High Court, confirmed by the Division Bench, may not be interfered with. 5.     We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the date of birth of the deceased was 1.7.1951. He was appointed as a Lecturer on 2.7.2001. He would have completed 60 years of his age on 30.06.2011. As per Government Order dated 16.09.2009, he would have exercised his option to retire at the age of 60 years on or before 1.7.2010, However, before he could exercise the option, unfortunately he died. In fact, he had died even prior to the Government order. He had died on 11.08.2009 whereas the Government order is dated 16.9.2009. Therefore, there was no chance for him to exercise any option at all. There is hence no merit in this appeal. The High Court has rightly observed that the respondent would be entitled to the benefit of the Government Order dated 16.9.2009 and would be entitled to the benefit of death-cum-retirement gratuity being the heirs of the deceased employee. At this stage, it is required to be noted that it is not the case on behalf of the appellants that if the deceased employee would have exercised the option, even then he would not have been entitled to the benefit of death-cum-retirement gratuity under the scheme. The deathcum-retirement gratuity is the benevolent scheme and the same is extended to the respondent being heirs/dependent of the deceased employee by the learned Single Judge, confirmed by the Division Bench. In the facts and circumstances of the case, no interference of this Court is called for. 6.     In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal fails and deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. We deprecate the practice of a State filing such cases before the Apex Court. Hence the appeal is dismissed with cost of Rs. 50,000/payable by the appellant to the respondent within a period of four weeks from today.
Appeal is filed assailing the order dated:17.10.2018 passed by Vth Additional Civil Judge and JMFC Court at Kalaburagi in C.C.No.2735/2013, wherein the learned JMFC dismissed the case for non-prosecution. 2.      The    brief  case   which  has   given   rise  for consideration of this appeal is that:- The appellant was a complainant before the Trial Court who      filed     a     private    complaint     against    the respondent/accused for offences under Section             138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short hereinafter referred to as ‘N.I Act’).          After recording the sworn statement,     the    criminal  case   number   was   given    as C.C.No.2735/2013, but the said case came to be dismissed for non-prosecution, as the complainant has not appeared before the Court. Being aggrieved by the impugned order, this appeal is filed. 3.      Heard Sri. Santosh Paitl, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri. M.A.Jagirdar, learned counsel for the 4.     The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the learned JMFC has not dismiss the case on merits instead the case was dismissed for default. Learned counsel submits that   respondent/accused       has    borrowed     a   sum   of Rs.4,50,000/- from the complainant. But the accused did not repay    the  said   amount     and    when    the   complainant approached him, the       accused    gave a cheque bearing No.037971 dated 12.02.2013 in favour of the complainant drawn on IDBI Bank Ltd., Kalaburagi. But the said cheque given by the respondent/accused came to be dishonoured with   an   endorsement    ‘in  sufficient   fund’.  Hence,  the complainant    issued   a    legal   notice.   Even    then  the respondent/accused did not turn-up to pay the amount. Hence the complainant filed a private complaint. But the Trial Court has dismissed the case of the complainant for default. Learned counsel argued that infact challenging the dismissal order, the appellant filed a revision petition under Section 397 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short hereinafter referred to as ‘Cr.P.C’) before the learned Sessions Judge in Crl.R.P.No.2/2019, learned Sessions judge vide order dated 21.10.2019 allowed the petition and directed to restore C.C.No.2735/2013 to its original file. Aggrieved by the said order, the respondent/accused filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C., before this Court, wherein this Court allowed the petition and held that the remedy of complainant/appellant is to file an appeal. Hence he has filed this appeal. Learned counsel also argued that this Court by order dated 16.8.2022 has condoned the delay. Looking into the stage of the case and the cheque amount involved, he prays to allow the appeal by remanding the matter back to the trial Court. 5.    Against     this     learned     counsel     for respondent/accused agued that there is an exorbitant delay in filing the appeal. Even looking into the averments made in the appeal, it does not show why he has not presented the appeal before this Court well in time. There are no valid grounds in the appeal to allow the appeal. The appellant should give detail reason for restoration of the case. In paragraph No.8 of the appeal memo, the grounds stated with regard to limitation cannot be considered, as it does not disclose sufficient cause for filing the appeal at a belated stage. In view of the fact that there is inordinate delay in filing  the  appeal,  if  the  appeal  is  allowed    and    the C.C.No.2735/2013 is restored to its original file, it will cause much hardship to the respondent/accused, as there is no bonafide    reason    mentioned    for   non-appearance       of complainant/appellant    before  Trial  Court.   The    learned counsel in support of his arguments, relied on the decision of Bombay High Court in the case of Vamsi Labs Private Ltd. Vs. Alpine laboratories, passed in Criminal Appeal No.498 Of 1998 dated 15.11.2019, wherein the Bombay High Court at paragraph No.6 has considered that there is no explanation regarding absence of complainant or his pleader. The Bombay High Court held that the Magistrate has rightly exercised jurisdiction under Section 256(1) of Cr.P.C and dismissed the appeal. With these contentions he prayed to dismiss the appeal. 6.   I have perused the appeal memo, the trial Court records and other materials placed on record. It is evident from the records that a complaint came to be lodged by the appellant under Section 138 of N.I.Act and the order sheet of the Trial Court reveals that the present respondent who is accused did not appear before the Court for several years and NBW came to be issued. Thereafter, the accused appeared and got himself released on bail. Though the case is of the year 2013, this respondent/accused appeared before the Court after five years i.e. on 13.06.2018. When the matter was posted for recording plea of accused, learned JMFC dismissed the complaint on 17.10.2018 for non- appearance of the complainant. 7.    Be that as it may, the appellant filed revision petition against said dismissal order. There was 44 days delay in filing the revision and that was condoned by the learned Sessions Judge and the revision was allowed. The complaint was restored to its original file. Against that order, respondent/accused filed criminal petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., which came to be allowed on 12.07.2021 by this Court. Consequently, this appeal is filed on 11.02.2022. 8.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag and another vs. Mst.Katiji and others reported in AIR (1987) Supreme Court 1353 at paragraph No.3 held as under: 6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalize injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so. Making a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause for condoning the delay in the institution of the appeal. 9.     In the light of these principles, let me consider the contentions of appellant. The order sheet of the trial court discloses that the respondent/accused did not appear before the Court when the summons was issued in the year 2013. Subsequently only after five years i.e., on 13.6.2018 he appeared before the Court. The case was posted for recording plea of the accused. On 15.9.2018 the accused was absent. But the Court without taking into consideration all these aspects after lapse of five years of lodging the complaint, kept the case pending for want of appearance of respondent/accused but, dismissed the complaint when the case is posted for recording plea of the accused for non- appearance of the complainant. The complainant presence is not at all essential at the time of recording plea of the accused is not at all essential. It is the duty of the Court to record  plea   of  the  accused     by   putting  substance  of accusation against him. The complainant presence is not all 10.   In order to appreciate dismissal of complaint, it is necessary to refer to the provisions of Section 256 of Cr.P.C, which reads as under: complainant.-(1) If the summons has been issued on complaint, and on the day appointed for the appearance of the accused, or any day subsequent thereto to which the hearing may be   adjourned,   the   complainant     does  not appear, the Magistrate shall, notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, acquit the accused, unless for some reason he thinks it proper to adjourn the hearing of the case to Provided   that  where   the  complainant     is represented by a pleader or by the officer conducting    the  prosecution   or  where    the Magistrate is of opinion that the personal attendance     of   the  complainant     is   not necessary, the Magistrate may dispense with his attendance and proceed with the case. (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall, so far as may be, apply also to cases where the non-appearance of the complainant is due to his death." 11.   On perusing the said Section, it is evident that the Court has to exercise its discretion judiciously. The proviso clearly indicates that when the Court is of the opinion that the personal attendance of the complainant is not necessary, the Magistrate may be dispense with attendance of complainant and proceed with the case. Here complainant is represented by an advocate. The stage of the case is for recording of plea. The complainant presence was not necessary and recording plea is by the Court. It is the task to be performed by the Court for progress of case. Therefore, when the presence of complainant on that day is not necessary, the learned JMFC ought not to have dismissed the complaint for non-appearance of the complainant. The case is not posted for hearing. For non-appearance of the complainant on each and every date of hearing, an order of acquittal cannot be passed in every case. The Court has to see the stage of the case and the previous appearance of the accused and complainant and how many years the complaint is pending, what is the nature of case before passing any such dismissal order. Simply to dispose of the cases or get rid of the case, the complaint cannot be dismissed when there no necessity of presence of complainant. 12.   Here the complainant’s case is under Section 138 of N.I Act. The amount of cheque involved is stated to be Rs.4,50,000/-. The sworn statement of complainant is given and he has produced documents in support of his case. Therefore, keeping in mind, the exercise of power under appeal and the peculiar facts and circumstance of this case, and in view of Section 256 Cr.P.C., in my considered view the appeal deserves to be allowed. Simply because the drafting of appeal memo is lacking some ingredients is not a ground to dismiss the appeal. Keeping in mind the purpose for which the Courts are meant and making justice oriented approach in my considered view, the appeal deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, I pass the following : i)    The appeal is allowed. ii)   The     order   dated    17.10.2018      passed  in C.C.No.2735/2013 by V Additional Civil Judge, JMFC, Kalaburagi is hereby set aside. The C.C.No.2735/2013 is restored to the original file of V Additional Civil Judge, JMFC, Kalaburagi. iii)  The Trial Court shall proceed further from the stage    when   the   complaint   is   dismissed in accordance with the procedure prescribed for trial of such cases. iv)   As the case of the year 2013, both Appellant and Respondent shall appear before Trial Court on    21.10.2022      and  assist    the   Court in disposing the said case as expeditiously as possible.
1.           The Appellant has challenged the Judgment and order dated 11/09/2017 passed in Sessions Case No.152 of 2015 by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kalyan. The Appellant was convicted for commission of offence punishable U/s.307 of I.P.C. and was sentenced to suffer R.I. for 7 years and to pay fine of Rs.3000/- and in default of payment of fine to suffer S.I. for 3 months. He was given benefit of set off U/s.428 of the Cr.p.c. The Appellant was acquitted from the Charges of commission of offence punishable U/s.150, 152 and 155 of the Indian Railways 2 of 21                 205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) 2.         Heard Shri. Swapnil Ovalekar, learned appointed Advocate for the Appellant and Shri. Agarkar, learned APP for the 3.         Learned   APP      has  submitted   a   report      from      the Superintendent of Nashik Road Central Prison dated 18/07/2022. It is mentioned in the report that the Appellant had suffered actual imprisonment of 5 years, 4 months and 8 days till 15/05/2022. After that he was released on Covid-19 parole and then he has not 4.         The prosecution case is that the injured Nandkumar Joshi in this case was travelling in a bogie for handicapped persons in Kasara bound local train. He boarded the train at Dombivali. At that time, the Appellant was standing at the door. It was difficult for the injured to enter the bogie and, therefore, there was some heated exchange of words. The other passengers supported the injured. One of them even slapped the Appellant. There was further trouble. The Appellant scuffled with others and pushed the injured Joshi from the bogie from a running train. Joshi fell down 3 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) and suffered compound fracture of his right elbow. He also suffered injuries on his head. The co-passengers caught the appellant in the bogie itself. Somebody pulled the chain. The train stopped at Kalyan station. In the meantime, the injured had walked back upto Dombivali railway station. He was helped by railway police. The Appellant was brought from Kalyan and was handed-over to the police. The F.I.R. was lodged. The investigation was carried out. The charge-sheet was filed and the case was committed to the court of Sessions. 5.         During trial, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses including the injured Nandkumar Joshi, two eye witnesses, the Motorman and the Guard of the local train, two Medical officers, G.R.P. personnels, Deputy Station Master of Kalyan Railway station and two Investigating Officers. 6.         The defence of the Appellant was that, he was travelling in that local train in a bogie for handicapped people. A passenger asked him to get down. He told him that he would get down on the next station, but the passengers started abusing and beating 4 of 21                 205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) him with kicks and fist blows, though he was standing at the inner side of the bogie. A false case was lodged against him. He has not committed anything wrong. His defence was not accepted by learned trial Judge. He believed the evidence of the prosecution. According to learned trial Judge, all the ingredients of Section 307 of I.P.C. were made out. After recording his conclusion, he convicted and sentenced the Appellant, as mentioned earlier. 7.         The prosecution case unfolds through the evidence of PW-1 Nandkumar Joshi. He has deposed that, he was having issue of blood pressure. He boarded a fast local train going towards Kasara at 7.19p.m. on 09/01/2015 from Dombivli railway station. He boarded a bogie for handicapped persons. The Appellant was standing at the door obstructing the entrance. PW-1 requested him to shift aside, but the Appellant started abusing and assaulting him with fists. The other passengers tried to pacify him, but he was not in a mood to listen. One of the co-passengers slapped the Appellant on the back side. PW-1 tried to intervene and stop the 5 of 21                   205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) quarrel, but the Appellant was angry with him due to the incident at the entrance of the bogie. He pushed the PW-1 from the bogie. PW-1 fell down. His right hand was fractured at the elbow joint. He also received six severe injuries to his head. He went towards Dombivli by walking. According to him, the incident took place between Dombivali and Thakurli railway station. He reached the platform No.2 of the Dombivali railway station. Somebody took him to the railway police on platform No.3. A memo from the Station Master was obtained and the PW-1 was taken to Shastri Nagar Hospital. The Medical Officer gave him first aid treatment and referred him to Sion Hospital. Till then his relatives came there. Then he was taken to Sai Sadan Hospital, Kalyan; where he was treated further. The police came to Sai Sadan Hospital and recorded his F.I.R. The F.I.R. was produced on record at Exhibit 15. He was hospitalized for about 9 to 10 days. He identified his own blood stained clothes in the Court. He also identified the Appellant in the Court. In the cross-examination, he deposed that, while lodging his F.I.R. he had mentioned that the said boy scuffled with him when he entered the bogie, however, that particular portion 6 of 21                  205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) was not mentioned in his statement before the police and he could not assign any reason as to why the word ‘scuffle’ was not mentioned in his statement. He was suffering from high blood pressure and he agreed that if his blood pressure shot up, he felt giddiness and usually fell down. On 09/01/2015, his blood pressure was high. He accepted that, because of heavy crowd there was no place to sit in the bogie. He denied the suggestion that, he fell down due to giddiness suffered because of blood pressure. After the incident, he saw the Appellant for the first time while his evidence was recorded in the Court. His F.I.R. at Exhibit 15 substantially corroborated his evidence. 8.          PW-4 Ashwin Purohit was one of the co-passengers. He has deposed that, he was travelling in the same bogie at the time of incident. PW-1 boarded the bogie at Dombivli railway station. There was exchange of words between the Appellant and PW-1. During that quarrel somebody shouted that, ‘uncle fell down from the train’. PW-4 and others tried to pull the chain, but the train did not stop. Some passengers caught the Appellant. The local train arrived at Kalyan station. Then they alighted at Kalyan railway 7 of 21                205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) station and approached the R.P.F. office and reported the incident. The Appellant was handed-over to R.P.F. officials. Then he was handedover to Dombivli police. This witness stated that, he was not in a position to identify the Appellant because he had seen him only once at the time of the incident. Thus, his evidence describes the incident in general and is not of much help to either the prosecution or the defence. Its Evidentiary value is limited. It only corroborates the prosecution case to a certain extent and demonstrates that the incident had taken place. 9.        PW-9 Vivek Bhor is another important eye witness. He has deposed that the incident took place on 09/01/2015. He caught the Kasara local train at Mulund station at 07.08p.m. One physically normal boy entered their bogie. The others told him to get down, but he started quarreling with them. At Dombivli railway station, PW-1 boarded the bogie. He also asked the Appellant why he had boarded that bogie and there was quarrel. The Appellant started scuffling and beating PW-1. This witness has further deposed that, the Appellant pushed PW-1 thrice. He pushed on his chest and therefore, PW-1 fell down. Then he also pushed 8 of 21                205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) PW-1’s legs. PW-1 fell down between Thakurli and Kalyan. The other passengers caught the Appellant. One Ashwin Purohit (PW-9) travelling in the train pulled the chain and also caught the Appellant. The others also helped him in catching the Appellant. The local train did not stop at Thakurli station, but stopped at Kalyan railway station at about 7.30p.m. Then railway officers along with R.P.F. came there. The Appellant was handed over to them. This witness identified the Appellant in the Court as the person who had pushed the PW-1 from the train. There were certain portions of his depositions which were not mentioned by him in his police statement. Those portions in the form of omissions were put to him. He could not explain as to why those portions were not appearing in his police station. He could not explain why it was not mentioned that, PW-1 was talking with the Appellant angrily, or that the Appellant beat PW-1, or that the Appellant pushed PW-1 thrice, or that he had given two jerks on the chest and one jerk on the leg. All these omissions were important, however, the defence has not taken care to prove these omissions through the evidence of the Investigating officer. 9 of 21                205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) Therefore, those omissions cannot be used by the defence in this From the evidence of these three witnesses i.e. PW-1, PW-4 and PW-9 the incident is established as to how the PW-1 was pushed by the Appellant outside the running train. The other evidence is mostly supportive in nature. 10.         PW-2 Harjiram Menon was Deputy Station Master at Kalyan Railway station. He has deposed that the concerned local arrived at Kalyan at 7.28p.m. The motorman gave a specific sound indicating an emergency and seeking help. The railway officials went to the local train and heard the noise from the coach for handicapped persons. They went there and found that the Appellant was caught by some passengers. The R.P.F. personnels were called. The boy was handedover to them and then he was taken to G.R.P. police station, Kalyan. This witness identified the Appellant in the Court. Thus, this witness has not deposed about the main incident, but has given evidence about handing over of the Appellant to the police officers. 11.        PW-3 Sachin Ugale was attached to G.R.P. Kalyan. He has deposed in a similar fashion as deposed by PW-2. He has deposed that, after the co-passengers had apprehended the Appellant, he was handed over to G.R.P. police station at Kalyan railway station. The co-passengers Vivek Bhor – PW-9 and Ashwin Purohit – PW-4 were with him. The incident had taken place within the jurisdiction of G.R.P. Dombivli police station and, therefore, the Appellant was taken there and was handed over to P.S.O. of Dombivali G.R.P. police station. 12.        PW-5 Suresh Jadhav was a point-man on platform Nos.4 and 5 of Kalyan railway station. He has also spoken about the co- passengers having caught the appellant. He has supported the evidence of PW-2 and 3. 13.        PW-6 Soheb Shaikh was a pancha in whose presence personal search of the Appellant was conducted and then clothes of the injured PW-1 were seized. Those panchanamas were produced on record at Exhibit 33 and 34. 14.        PW-7 Ramgopal Verma was a Motorman of the said local 11 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) train. He has deposed that the train halted at Dombivli platform at 7.25p.m. Thereafter it started from Dombivli and had reached around Thakurli. He noticed the buzzer and audio sound indicating chain pulling. According to him, at that time, the speed of his local train was upto 100 Kms. per hour, but because of that sound he reduced the speed to about 20Kms. per hour. Then he gave a signal to the Guard who responded by giving normal buzzer after verifying the situation. Therefore, he took the train to Kalyan railway station. Then he gave whistle sound indicating some trouble. The Station Master responded and then the Appellant was 15.        PW-8 Prakash Swami was the Guard on that train. He has deposed similar to PW-7. 16.        PW-10 Dr. Majetia Shamjibhai and PW-11 Dr. Swapnil Zambre were examined by the prosecution to prove injuries. Both of them had treated the injured PW-1. It is hardly in dispute that the injured PW-1 had suffered following injuries: i) Compound fracture injury on right forearm. 12 of 21                 205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) ii) Multiple C.L.W. on scalp over left ear-pinna. In the cross-examination of PW-10, he accepted that if the blood pressure shoots up the person may feel giddiness and because of fall due to giddiness these injuries were possible. He also accepted that there was no abnormalities in the brain of PW-1. 17.        PW-11 Dr. Zambre elaborated and deposed that, there was Grade 3 B open fracture of radius ulna with bone loss. Size of the injury was 8cm x 6cm x bone deep. The nature of injury was grievous and dangerous to life. The injuries were possible if a person was pushed from a running train. The second stage surgery failed and the patient was advised for third stage surgery, but the patient did not respond positively. All the medical papers were produced on record. This witness also accepted that PW-1 was suffering from blood pressure and those injuries were possible if a person fell down from a running train because of giddiness caused by blood pressure. 18.        PW-12 P.S.I. Jayant Dumbre was attached to Dombivali (Railway) police station. He has deposed that, PW-1 came to their 13 of 21              205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) police station at about 10.00p.m. to 10.15p.m. and narrated the incident. PW-1 was sent to Shastri Nagar Hospital, Dombivli along with memo issued by the Station Master of Dombivli railway station. The report of PW-1 was reduced into writing in the hospital. This witness had carried out personal search of the Appellant brought by two passengers. The clothes of the victim were seized. The medical papers were collected by him. He identified the Appellant before the Court. 19.        PW-13 Mahesh Bagve was the next Investigating Officer. He had recorded the statements of various witnesses. He carried out the remaining investigation and had submitted the charge- 20.        Learned counsel for the Appellant made following That the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence of PW-1, PW-4 and PW-9 is not consistent. PW-9 himself has given contrary answers and there are major omissions in his evidence. The injuries could have been 14 of 21              205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) possible because of the fall caused by high blood pressure. The nature of injuries do not match with the description of the 21.        Learned APP, on the other hand, submitted that the prosecution has proved its case through the evidence of PW-1, PW- 4 and PW-9. Rest of the evidence sufficiently corroborates their version. The Appellant was caught at the spot by co-passengers. The PW-4 and PW-9 have specifically deposed about his arrest. 22.        I have considered these submissions. The evidence of PW-1, PW-4 and PW-9 is consistent on major aspects. Though there are minor discrepancies regarding some minor details, the incident as a whole is consistently deposed by them. There are some omissions in the evidence of PW-9 Vivek Bhor, but as mentioned earlier, these omissions are not proved through the evidence of the Investigating Officer. Even if those omissions are ignored, the consistent fact which is proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt is that, after PW-1 boarded the train there was a quarrel between him and the Appellant. There was also scuffle and 15 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) quarrel between the Appellant and other passengers. In that incident the Appellant deliberately pushed the PW-1 from a running train. The PW-1 fell down and suffered these injuries. Though, PW-4 had not actually seen the PW-1 falling from the train, the PW-1 himself has deposed that, because of the push given by the Appellant, he had fallen down. To that extent, the PW- 9 has supported the version of PW-1. Thus, the prosecution has proved that, because of the quarrel the appellant got angry and he deliberately pushed the PW-1 from a running train. 23.       The Appellant was caught in the bogie itself by co- passengers. This fact is consistently deposed and proved through the evidence of PW-4 and PW-9. In that behalf, both these witnesses corroborate each other. They are further corroborated by the evidence of PW-2 the Deputy Station Master of Kalyan Railway station, PW-3 Sachin Ugale – G.R.P. personnel and PW-5 Suresh Jadhav. These witnesses have deposed as to how the Appellant was already caught by the co-passengers and how he was taken in their custody by the officers. Thus, the prosecution has also proved that the Appellant was caught by the co-passengers in the bogie itself 16 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) after he had pushed the PW-1 from a running train. Though, PW-4 has not identified the Appellant, the PW-1, PW-9 and other witnesses have identified the Appellant. Thus, the prosecution has proved that the co-passengers had caught the Appellant in the bogie after the incident. He was immediately caught at the scene of offence. 24.       The medical evidence is also clear enough. The PW-11 has deposed that the injury was grievous and dangerous to life. The injuries suffered by PW-1 are undisputed. Though, the injuries are possible by falling from a running train; it is also established that the Appellant had pushed the PW-1 and, therefore, he has caused those injuries to PW-1. 25.       PW-7 Ramgopal Verma was a Motorman and in spite of having received an indication of chain pulling, he went ahead upto Kalyan railway station because of the signal given by the Guard. He has deposed that the train was running at a speed of 100 Kms. per hour when he received the signal of chain pulling. The incident had taken place soon after the train had left the Dombivli railway 17 of 21               205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) station. The train was gathering speed. But when the PW-1 fell down, the prosecution has not proved that, at that point of time the train was running at a speed of 100 Kms. per hour. The chain was pulled after the PW-1 had already fallen down from the bogie. Thus, the prosecution has not proved that, at that point of time the train was running in a high speed. What is proved by the prosecution is that the injured PW-1 was pushed from a running train and that itself was dangerous. The prosecution has also not established whether the injured PW-1 fell on another railway track or on the side where there was no to and fro traffic of the local trains. This aspect is important in considering whether the Appellant had requisite intention necessary U/s.307 of I.P.C. Thus, from the above discussion, I am of the opinion that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that, in the quarrel and scuffle the Appellant had deliberately pushed the PW-1 from a running train, causing grievous injury. 26.        The next crucial question is whether the offence would fall within the four corners of Section 307 of I.P.C. In that behalf, 18 of 21              205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) the prosecution evidence is lacking. The prosecution case falls short of proving offence U/s.307 of I.P.C. From the evidence discussed above, it is clear that the Appellant was not knowing the injured PW-1. There was no premeditation and no preparation for commission of offence. The incident had taken place suddenly as a result of sudden quarrel. In that quarrel the Appellant got angry and pushed PW-1 from a running train. Therefore, his intention or knowledge cannot be stretched to conclude that he attempted to commit murder of PW-1. Though, it is proved that the injured PW- 1 had suffered grievous injury, which was even dangerous to his life, the requisite intention and knowledge mentioned U/s.307 of I.P.C. is not proved. From the nature of evidence, in my view, though the ingredients of Section 307 of I.P.C. are not proved, the ingredients of Section 308 of I.P.C. are proved by the prosecution. Section 308 of I.P.C. reads thus: “308. Attempt to commit culpable homicide. - Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both; and, if hurt is caused to any person by such act, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.” 27.       As mentioned earlier, it was a sudden fight and, therefore, there was no premeditation or preparation. At the same time, the Appellant had pushed the injured from a running train, therefore, he can be attributed knowledge that his act was endangering to life of the PW-1. Therefore, his act would fall within the meaning of Section 308 of I.P.C. To that extent, the conviction recorded against the Appellant needs to be modified and instead of Section 307 of I.P.C. the Appellant will have to be convicted U/s.308 of I.P.C. which is a lesser offence. Since, in the incident hurt is caused to         PW-1, the maximum punishment prescribed U/s.308 of the I.P.C. can extend to 7 years. But in the present case, looking at the nature of injuries suffered by PW-1, it is not a case where maximum punishment is required to be imposed on the Appellant. At the time of arrest, the Appellant was hardly of 22 years old. He was recently married and was blessed 20 of 21                 205-apeal-128-18 (Judgment) with a child only a few days before the incident. These are the mitigating circumstances in deciding the quantum of sentence. The Appellant has already suffered 5 years, 4 months and 8 days of imprisonment for his act. Thus, the sentence can be reduced to the period he has already undergone. 28.       With the result, following order is passed: i)   The Appeal is partly allowed. ii) The conviction and sentence of the Appellant recorded U/s.307 of the I.P.C. is set aside. iii) Instead, the Appellant is convicted for commission of offence punishable U/s.308 of the I.P.C. His sentence is reduced to the period which he has already undergone. iv) The imposition of fine of Rs.3000/- and in default of payment of fine, sentence to suffer S.I. for 3 months is maintained. v) The Appellant is granted benefit of Section 428 of the Cr.p.c.

After hearing the learned senior counsel and learned Solicitor General, we are of the view that the interest of justice demands that the following order be passed. We record the submission of Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Respondent-State of Maharashtra that if permission is applied by Sakal Hindu Samaj for holding contemplated meeting on 05.02.2023 and if permission is granted it will be subject to the condition that nobody will make any hate speech and in defiance of law or disturbing the public order. Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant/petitioner drew our attention to Section 151 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Section 151 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short "151. Arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences. (1) A police officer knowing of a design to commit any cognizable offence may arrest, without orders from a Magistrate and without a warrant, the person so designing, if it appears to such officer that the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented. (2) No person arrested under sub-section (1) shall be detained in custody for a period exceeding twenty-four hours from the time of his arrest unless his further detention is required or authorised under any other provisions of this Code or of any other law for the time being in force." Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Respondent-State of Maharashtra would submit that the State is not concerned with Section 151 of the Cr.P.C. alone but it is concerned with the entire gamut of law. We also direct that the Officer(s), in case, permission is granted and, in case, the occasion arises for invoking the power under Section 151 of Cr.P.C. as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the Officer(s) concerned to invoke the said power and to act as per the mandate of Section 151 of the Cr.P.C. Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant/petitioner points out that having regard to what has happened according to the petitioner on earlier occasion (29th of January, 2023), the meeting may be video- graphed and the same shall be presented before this Court. Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Respondent-State of Maharashtra does not oppose the said request and would submit that the he has no objection to carry out videography of the meeting in question, if the meeting takes place. Accordingly, we direct that the Police Inspector of the area in question will conduct videography of the meeting in question and it shall be made available to this Court on the next date of hearing.

2.    The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as “the National Commission”) on 07th June 2019 had passed the following order in the Revision Petition No. 483 of 2018 filed by the respondent-SBI. “The revision petition is allowed. The complaint is dismissed, with liberty to the complainant to approach a competent civil court as per the law. It goes without saying that, if the complainant chooses to bring action in a civil court, he is free to file an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and, in such contingency, the chronological facts and proceedings in the consumer protection fora would be application. Learned counsel for the revisionist State Bank of India submits that it will not press the issue of limitation if action is brought by the complainant in a civil court. Reasoned judgment to follow.” 3. The National Commission passed impugned judgement on 14th June, 2019, allowing the said Revision Petition. Being aggrieved by the said judgement and order, the appellant (original complainant) has filed the present appeal. 4. The short facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the appellant- complainant had filed the consumer case being no. 08 of 2014 before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Purba Medinipur (hereinafter referred to as “the Consumer Forum”) alleging inter-alia that the appellant i.e., Sunil Kr. Maity had a saving account number 01190010167 with the respondent-bank since January, 2000. On 24.02.2010, the said account number was changed to number 10140478732. On 15.09.2012, the appellant went to deposit a sum of Rs. 500/- in the said account, when a staff of respondent-bank informed him that the account number had again been changed and wrote account number being 32432609504 on his passbook. The said amount was deposited in the said account number. Thereafter, on 16.01.2013, appellant deposited a cheque being no. 670013 for Rs. 3,00,000/- drawn on SBI of the said Branch issued by one Prabir Pradhan having an SBI account number 030608507950. When the appellant went to update his passbook on 11.12.2013, he noticed that his passbook showed the balance of Rs. 59/- only, though he had not made any transaction between 16.01.2013 to 11.12.2013. On the enquiry having been made, the respondent-bank informed the appellant that there was another customer by the name Sunil Maity (the respondent no. 2 herein) whose account number was 32432609504 and the said account number was wrongly given to the appellant whose name was Sunil Kr Maity on 15.09.2012. The said Sunil Maity (respondent no. 2) on 25.01.2013 and 28.01.2013 had withdrawn the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- and Rs. 2,00,000/- respectively from the said account number. The appellant-complainant therefore wrote letters to the respondent-bank but in vain. He thereafter filed the complaint before the Consumer Forum against the respondent-SBI and the said Sunil Maity. 5. Both the respondents had entered their appearance and filed their respective replies to the complaint filed by the appellant-complainant. The Consumer Forum after appreciating all the documents filed by the appellant as well as by the respondents in the light of their pleadings, allowed the complaint vide the order dated 14.05.2014. 6. Being aggrieved by the said order, the respondent-bank had preferred the First Appeal being No. 784 of 2014 before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, West Bengal (hereinafter referred to as State Commission), which by the order dated 25 October, 2017 partly allowed the appeal. The State Commission while confirming the rest of the order passed by the Consumer Forum, modified it to the extent that the order for fine @ Rs. 100/- per diem was struck off. The State Commission after a closer scrutiny of the documents on “On closer scrutiny of the documents on record, following facts emerge. First, we find that there was complete parity in the signature being put on the deposit slip pertaining to the disputed cheque for an amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- vis-à- contained in the official record of the bank. Respondent No. 1 signs in English; whereas, ‘Sunil Maity’, account-holder of saving account no. 32432609504 signs in Bengali. Significant here to note that while depositing the cheque for Rs. 3,00,000/-, the depositor was mentioned as ‘Sunil Kr. Maity’. Thirdly, it seems that the Respondent No. 1 voluntarily disclosed the source wherefrom did he get the said cheque. On the other hand, the Respondent No. 2, stated to be a salaried person, has not uttered any word in this regard. Since, Rs. 3.00.000/- is quite a considerable sum, reluctance of the Respondent No. 2 to disclose the source wherefrom did he receive the said cheque, if at all received, does raise eyebrows. Fourthly, it is only natural that one would write his name properly while filling up the deposit slip. There is no reason to believe that ‘Sunil Maity’ (Respondent No. 1) would write his name in the deposit slip as ‘Sunil Fifthly, since banks quite meticulously check the name, account no., amount, date etc. before/while crediting proceeds of cheques/demand drafts etc., it was but natural that while the disputed cheque was issued in the name of ‘Sunil Kr. Maity’, the Respondent No. 2 would impress upon the issuer of the said cheque to correctly write his name as ‘Sunil Maity’ by issuing another cheque. The amount being quite substantial, the Respondent No. 2 could hardly afford such leaving anything to chances. Sixthly, there is nothing to show that Respondent No. 2 can write his name in English. Therefore, questions depositing the cheque in English. Seventhly, it appears from the WV submitted by the appellant that when the Respondent No. 1 lodged complaint with it, the Appellant, on several occasions, Manager. However, on one pretext or the other, the Respondent No. 2 avoided meeting him. An honest person never fight shy of proving his bona fide. Lastly, the Respondent No. 2 has not placed on record any counter part of deposit slip to show that the said amount were indeed deposited by him. All these emerging facts induce us to hold that the disputed cheque indeed belonged to the Respondent No. Given that it is virtually impossible for one to know the account number of another person, and more so, as passbook is stated to be updated by Group ‘D’ staff of the bank, it would be myopic not to believe that the goof up created at the end of the Appellant itself. Besides this, since the Appellant made a great blunder while crediting the amount of the cheque to the account of Respondent No. 2, we feel, the Appellant must own up due responsibility in this regard.” 7. The respondent-bank being aggrieved by the said order had preferred the Revision Petition before the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act (hereinafter referred to as “the said Act”). The National Commission allowed the said revision application vide the impugned order as stated hereinabove. 8. It is pertinent to note that pending the revision application, the National Commission had called for a report on the whole matter from the SBI. Accordingly, a report dated 19th March, 2019 was filed by the Regional Manager of the SBI. Relying upon the said report, the National Commission allowed the revision application filed by the bank, by observing inter-alia that though revisional jurisdiction of the Commission under section 21(b) of the Act, 1986 has a defined purview and ambit, it does allow interference if grave misappreciation of evidence or superficial appraisal of a case is discernible on the part of the two fora below. This court is at a loss to understand as to how the National Commission could have sought for a report at the revisional stage, that too from an officer of the party which already had an opportunity to submit all the documents necessary for the purpose of defending itself before the Consumer Forum, and as to how such a report in the form of an additional evidence produced at the revisional stage could be relied upon, in respect of which the two fora below had no opportunity to deal with. 9. It is needless to say that the revisional jurisdiction of the National Commission under Section 21(b) of the said Act is extremely limited. It should be exercised only in case as contemplated within the parameters specified in the said provision, namely when it appears to the National Commission that the State Commission had exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or had failed to exercise jurisdiction so vested, or had acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. In the instant case, the National Commission itself had exceeded its revisional jurisdiction by calling for the report from the respondent-bank and solely relying upon such report, had come to the conclusion that the two fora below had erred in not undertaking the requisite in-depth appraisal of the case that was required. In the opinion of the Court, both the State Commission as well as the Consumer Forum had elaborately appreciated the documents on record and passed the reasoned orders. The report that tries to absolve the respondent-bank of its liability is based on surmises and conjectures as it abstrusely and without evidence holds that the bank has every reason to believe that wrong account number was intentionally inserted by the appellant himself for reasons best known to the appellant or on account of negligence by the appellant by not keeping the passbook in his safe and proper custody. The suppositions are contradictory as well as incredulous and fanciful. The appellant did not know the second respondent and would not have known his account number unless given to him by a bank officer. There was no way that the appellant would have known that the second respondent, namely Sunil Maity had an account in the same branch. No sane person would deposit cash or cheque meant to be deposited in his account in an account number belonging to another person with similar name. On the other hand, the bank should have been extra cautious given the fact that accounts of the appellant, Sunil Kumar Maity, and the second respondent, Sunil Maity, were with the same bank branch. What is rather surprising is that the National Commission for setting aside the findings and conclusion recorded by the District and State Forum, simply reproduced the report by one of the officers of the party in litigation with the appellant. The National Commission has not adverted and delved into the sound reasoning given by the State Commission as quoted above. 10.     Though a party can produce additional evidence at the appellate stage, the same has to be within the four corners of law, that is as contemplated in order-41, R.27. The party has to establish that notwithstanding the exercise of due diligence, such evidence was not within its knowledge or could not even after due diligence, be produced by it at the time when the decree appealed against was passed. Apart from the fact that there is a vast difference between the exercise of appellate jurisdiction and the revisional jurisdiction, no such application was filed by the respondent-bank before the National Commission. Under the circumstances, calling for the report by the National Commission on its own from the officer of the bank was absolutely unwarranted. 11.     Further, it is also well settled legal position1 that requirement of leading detailed evidence could not be a ground to shut the doors of any forum created under the Act like the Consumer Protection Act. The anvil on which entertainability of a complaint by a forum under the Act is to be determined, is whether the 1 CCI Chambers Coop. Hsg. Society Ltd. vs. Development Credit Bank Ltd. questions, though complicated they may be, are capable of being determined by summary enquiry. 12.   The National Commission therefore has grossly erred in observing in the impugned order that the appellant-complainant would be at liberty to seek remedy in the competent Civil Court and that if he chooses to bring an action in a Civil Court, he is free to file an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, recording the statement of Ld. Counsel for the SBI that it will not press the issue of limitation if action is brought by the complainant in a Civil Court. Such an observation/order passed by the National Commission is in utter ignorance of the provisions of the Limitation Act, in as much as Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not apply to the institution of civil suit in the Civil Court. Be that as it may, the impugned order passed by the National Commission solely relying upon the suo-moto report called for from the respondent-bank during the pendency of the revision application, being highly erroneous, deserves to be set aside and is accordingly set aside. The order passed by the State Commission is restored. The appeal stands allowed accordingly.
1.           This appeal questions an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,1 (hereinafter, “NCDRC”) which allowed the insurance claim of Levi Strauss (India) Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter, “Levi / insured / respondent”). Prior to this order, United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (hereinafter, “insurer / appellant”) had repudiated the policy issued to Levi. 2.           The insurer issued to Levi a Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy (hereinafter, “SFSP Policy”), for the period of 01.01.2007 to 31.12.2007. This policy covered Levi’s stocks while in storage for the sum of ₹ 30 crores. Levi obtained another SFSP Policy for the period of 01.01.2008 to 31.12.2008 on similar terms. Meanwhile, the parent company of Levi (i.e., Levi Strauss & Co.) had obtained a global policy from Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty Digitally signed by Dr. (hereinafter, “Allianz”) for the period of 01.05.2008 to 30.04.2009, covering C.C. No. 213/2011, dated 01.08.2019. stocks of all its subsidiaries, including Levi. The coverage through this stock throughout policy (hereinafter, “STP Policy” or “foreign policy”) was for $10 million in any one vessel or conveyance, and $50 million in any one location. The parent company also got another “all risks” policy (hereinafter, “AR Policy”) issued by Allianz for the same period i.e., from 01.05.2008 to 01.05.2009 covering the stocks of its subsidiaries throughout the world being commercial lines policy. The limit of liability of the AR Policy was up to $ 100 million. 3.     During subsistence of all these policies, on 13.07.2008, a fire broke out in one of the warehouses containing Levi’s stocks. On 18.07.2008, Levi claimed ₹12.20 crores from the insurer. The claim form furnished to the insurer on that date valued extent of loss to be slightly higher at ₹ 12.5 crores. However, on the instructions of the global insurer of the parent company, the Surveyor & Loss Assessor Mr. K.P. Sen submitted a status report on 28.07.2008 provisionally assessing the loss at a higher figure of ₹14.30 crores. The insurer i.e., the appellant appointed its professional surveyor, Professional Surveyors and Loss Adjusters Pvt. Ltd., for an assessment. The surveyor submitted the final Survey Report dated 08.08.2009 assessing the net loss at ₹11.34 crores. The insurer’s report recommended that it was not liable for the claim in view of Condition No. 4 in the SFSP Policy due to the policies issued by Allianz. 4.     After considering the materials including Survey Report and the conditions of the policies, the insurer repudiated Levi’s claim on 11.09.2009.                 The repudiation letter stated as follows: “The affected stocks in the present claim, at the hands of the logistics provider would squarely fall within the scope of the aforesaid Marine cover, in storage in the course of movement to retail locations. Condition No.4 of the Fire Policy issued by us reads as under: - “4. This insurance does not cover any loss or damage to property which, at the time of the happening of such loss or damage is insured by or would, but for the existence of this policy, be insured by any marine policy or policies except in respect of any excess beyond the amount which would have been payable under the marine policy or policies had this insurance not                         been                          effected." The Fire Policy thus excludes liability for such loss payable under marine policy, had the Fire Policy not been effected. In view of coverage under the Companies Insurance Policy being a marine cover, Condition No.4 of the Fire Policy is attracted and you have to recover the loss from the marine policy. In fact Clause 47 of the marine policy stipulates that "where the Assured.... Are obligated by legislation or otherwise to arrange insurance locality, they shall continue to have the full benefits of these insurance in respect to difference in perils insured:...." Therefore, Clause 47 rather than excluding liability in such cases of local Policy being available, agrees to pay where loss is not payable under such local policy. The aforesaid clause is thus intended to operate even in respect of property required to be insured locally, to the extent that the local policy may not apply. In this case since the Fire Policy excludes liability where there is a marine policy, it is a situation contemplated by Clause 47 and therefore marine policy cannot refuse to answer the claim. Accordingly, the Companies Insurance Policy being applicable to the affected stocks and there is nothing to indicate that the extent of liability for insurer thereunder would be less than the loss suffered, we have no liability under the fire Policy issued by us. We therefore regret our inability entertain the claim.” The Complaint and Proceedings before NCDRC 5.     Levi approached NCDRC with its complaint under Sections 21 and 22 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter, “Act”). It alleged that in view of Section 25 of the General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act, 1972 (hereinafter, “Nationalization Act”) it was obligated to obtain a policy issued by a domestic insurer to cover various risks, and that as a consequence, the condition in Clause 47 of the STP Policy (which guaranteed coverage of the foreign policy in the event that the insured was obliged to seek domestic policy) was met. 6.     It was further argued that the SFSP policy was to cover loss exclusive of $50 million inventory, which was the limit indicated in the STP Policy. Levi alleged that claim repudiation on the ground that the risk was covered by the global insurance policies (the STP Policy included) was contrary to Clause 41 (on ‘other insurance clauses’) of the STP Policy. In fact, Levi also argued that Clause 41 provided that if any fire insurance was specifically available to it, the STP Policy would be void to the extent of such being available. 7.     The insurer’s defence was that the SFSP Policy did not cover any loss or damage to the property which at the time of the happening of such loss or damage was insured, and which, but for the existence of the SFSP Policy, was insured by any marine policy or policies except in respect of any excess beyond the amount which would have been payable under such marine policy. The insurer argued the fire policy issued by it, therefore excluded liability in respect of property covered by marine policy. The further argument was that in Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy, coverage under the marine policy i.e., the STP policy, was excluded. It was submitted that Levi could (and did) recover loss from the STP Policy. In this regard it was argued that Clause 47 of the STP Policy would continue to cover the insured if the local laws or other conditions obligated the insured (i.e., Levi) to arrange insurance locally. In the present case, it was submitted that Levi was not obliged to secure a domestic policy. 8.     The impugned order allowed Levi’s complaint. The NCDRC did not finally decide whether the STP Policy was a marine policy. It held, on a consideration of Clause 47 of the STP Policy, that to the extent of the insured risk being covered by the domestic policy, coverage by the STP Policy stood excluded. The impugned order was based on the reasoning that there was difference in the perils insured and the conditions and / or limits of liability under the domestic policy and the STP Policy. Therefore, the loss of profit which Levi would have earned on sale of the damaged/destroyed cost was payable to it by Allianz, whereas the loss suffered by Levi to the extent of the cost of those goods would be reimbursable under the domestic policy issued by the insurer. After noting that Levi had received $4.54 million (which, when converted into Indian currency, worked out to be ₹ 19.52 crores), the claim was allowed to the extent of ₹ 1.78 crores. 9.       Mr. A.K. De, learned counsel appearing for the insurer argued that on a reading of the STP Policy issued by Allianz, fire risk in question was covered by virtue of the STP Policy being applicable whilst in transit and/or in store or elsewhere, including whilst at retail locations. It was argued that the impugned order erroneously interpreted Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy issued by it (i.e., insurer) and Clause 47 of the STP Policy (issued by Allianz) to hold that the loss caused to the goods was covered by the SFSP Policy, and loss of earnings of Levi was covered by the STP Policy. It was argued that there was no basis either in the pleadings or in the material on record to bear out this distinction. 10.      It was pointed out that the NCDRC completely overlooked the fact that in the claim form dated 18.07.2008, Levi specifically alleged that it suffered a loss of ₹12.4 crores, and against this, received $4.54 million (equivalent to ₹ 19.52 crores) from Allianz. Clearly, on its own showing, Levi collected far more than the actual loss admitted by it. It was also argued that the NCDRC erred in not considering the facts of the case and in upholding Levi’s argument that the STP Policy covered the loss sustained by virtue of loss of profit in addition to the cost of goods destroyed, and that the SFSP Policy covered only loss. It was argued that the loss suffered or included was a composite one which could not be bifurcated in the manner that NCDRC was persuaded to, at the behest of Levi. 11.      Mr. Joy Basu, learned senior counsel for Levi argued that by virtue of Clause 47 of the STP issued by Allianz, the findings of the NCDRC were justly warranted. It was urged that the primary obligation by law to arrange insurance locally i.e., through a domestic insurer, reflected the statutory mandate which arose in this case by virtue of Section 2(c)(b) of the Insurance Act, 1938 (hereinafter, “Act”) and Section 25 of the Nationalization Act. It was also urged that arguendo, if it were to be held that there was no legal obligation, nevertheless, Clause 47 contemplated other obligations by use of the term “or otherwise”. In the present case, Levi was under a contractual obligation – in addition to its obligation under Section 25 – to cover its risk under a domestic policy. In such an event, by the virtue of Clause 47, the primary liability towards the insured risk lay with the domestic insurer, i.e., the appellant. 12.     It is submitted that if such a domestic policy had not been availed, there would’ve been non-compliance of Clause 47 of the STP Policy which would have entitled Allianz to repudiate any claim if and when made by the parent company of Levi. It was further argued that Clause 47 of the STP Policy had to be read harmoniously with Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy. The coverage under both policies was envisioned to be mutually exclusive. 13.     It was argued next that by virtue of Clause 47 of the STP Policy, the fire incident cast liability upon the appellant insurer, and did not result in repudiation of the SFSP Policy. It was submitted in this regard that the SFSP Policy contained specific exclusions. Clause 9 of the General Exclusion condition was relied upon to show that specific kinds of profit or earnings were excluded i.e., loss of profit / opportunity cost as being not payable under the domestic policy. Consequently, all in direct losses stood excluded. Such a specific condition did not rule out other kinds of loss of profits. It was urged that the primary aim or purpose of the SFSP Policy was to cover all manner of losses arising out of insurable incidents of different kinds. In this case that was fire; the only amount payable under the SFSP Policy was relatable to loss. Undoubtedly, the SFSP Policy expressly disassociated itself from loss other than manufacturing as a result of fire. That was covered by the STP Policy. Consequently, there was no overlap between the claims under the two policies. 14.      It was argued that the insurer in its repudiation letter dated 11.09.2009 and 29.01.2010 specifically took a position with respect to liability, by holding that Clause 47 was not intended to operate in respect of the property. It was therefore argued that the insurer was liable to the extent of the local policy applicable. Learned Counsel relied upon the decision of M/s. Galada Power and Telecommunication Ltd. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd2 to submit that the insurer could not be allowed to travel beyond the grounds on which the claim was repudiated by it. Therefore, the appellant could not be allowed to resist the claim on the ground that it was payable under the AR Policy, even if it was not payable under the STP Policy issued by Allianz. 15.      Learned senior counsel urged that it was only after attaining full clarity on the aspects of difference in conditions with regard to profit element and manufacturing cost, and affording the insurer an opportunity to dispute and question the same, did the NCDRC pass the impugned order, which assessed the loss. It was argued that first, the NCDRC took the figures in terms of report of the Domestic Surveyor appointed by it, who assessed gross cost of goods at ₹ 12.59 crores. A sum of ₹ 88.57 lakhs was deducted from that for seconds goods (after washing and drying); and cost of stock impacted by fire was assessed @ ₹ 11.70 crores. Salvage of ₹ 36 lakhs was assessed by the Domestic Surveyor. It was deducted, bringing the net loss to ₹ 11.34 crores. The NCDRC noted that Levi claimed ₹ 9.08 crore in its complaint. 16.      To reconcile the figures, NCDRC noticed the affidavit of Kevin Heston Whelan and the Final Survey Report of the Foreign Surveyor, which found that the Foreign Surveyor assessed salvage at ₹ 2.6 crores, i.e., higher than that assessed by the Domestic Surveyor. If this salvage amount is deducted from the figure of ₹ 11.70 crores instead, then the figure of ₹ 9.1 crores was payable to Levi by the insurer (after deduction of policy excess of ₹ 10,000/-). It was urged that in the alternative, NCDRC also assessed insurer’s liability on the basis of assessment by the Global Insurer’s surveyor, which ultimately worked out to a total figure of ₹ 27 crores. After deducting the sum of ₹ 19.52 crores, the balance i.e., ₹ 7.48 crores was held payable by the insurer. 17.     Counsel lastly urged that if the insurer’s interpretation of the SFSP policy, as well as Clause 47 of the STP policy were to be accepted, the result would be anomalous inasmuch as the SFSP policy would in effect result in no coverage. In such case, the insurer would have collected the premia (which it undoubtedly did) without any liability at all. 18.     The first issue involved before the NCDRC was whether the STP Policy was a marine policy. The NCDRC considered the stipulations in the policy, having regard to Condition No. 4 in the SFSP Policy. However, it did not return any positive finding that the STP Policy was a marine policy. Since the parties have joined issues on this aspect, and made submissions, the issue has to be decided, particularly in the context of the Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy and provisions of law. It would therefore, be relevant to examine the provisions of the Marine Insurance Act, 1963 in addition to other provisions. Section 3 of the Act defines marine insurance. The expression “marine adventure” is defined by Section 2(d). Similarly, “maritime peril” referred to in “marine adventure” is defined in Section 2(e). Those definitions are extracted below: (d) "marine adventure" includes any adventure where - (i) any insurable property is exposed to maritime perils; (ii) the earnings or acquisition of any freight, passage money, commission, profit or other pecuniary benefit, or the security for any advances, loans, or disbursements is endangered by the exposure or insurable property to maritime (iii) any liability to a third party may be incurred by the owner of, or other persons interested in or responsible for, insurable property by reason of (e) "maritime perils" means the perils consequent on, or incidental to, the navigation of the sea, that is to say, perils of the seas, fire, war perils, pirates, rovers, thieves, captures, seizures, restraints and detainments of princes and people, jettisons, barratry and any other perils which are either of the like kind or may be designated by the policy..” 19.     Section 4 clarifies that a contract of marine insurance may, by its express terms, or by usage of trade, be extended so as to protect the assured against losses on inland waters or on any land risk which may be incidental to any sea voyage. The provisions of Marine Insurance Act are therefore subject to the terms of the policy of insurance. Sections 3 and 4 read as follows: “3. Marine insurance defined.—A contract of marine insurance is an agreement whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the assured, in the manner and to the extent thereby agreed, against marine losses, that is to say, the losses incidental to marine adventure. (1) A contract of marine insurance may, by its express terms, or by usage of trade, be extended so as to protect the assured against losses on inland waters or on any land risk which may be incidental to any sea voyage. (2) Where a ship in course of building or the launch of a ship, or any adventure analogous to a marine adventure, is covered by a policy in the form of a marine policy, the provisions of this Act, in so far as applicable, shall apply thereto, but except as by this section provided, nothing in this Act shall affect any rule of law applicable to any contract of insurance other than a contract of marine insurance as by this Act defined. Explanation.—“An adventure analogous to a marine adventure” includes an adventure where any ship, goods or other movables are exposed to perils incidental to local or inland transit.” Section 57 states that where the subject matter insured is destroyed, or so damaged so as to cease to be a thing of the kind insured, or where the assured is irretrievably deprived thereof, there is an actual total loss. 20.     It is also relevant to note at this stage that Section 2 (13A) of the Insurance Act, 1938 too defines “marine insurance” expansively. It reads as follows: “(13A) “marine insurance business” means the business of effecting contracts of insurance upon vessels of any description, including cargoes, freights and other interests which may be legally insured, in or in relation to such vessels, cargoes and freights, goods, wares, merchandise and property of whatever description insured for any transit, by land or water, or both, and whether or not including warehouse risks or similar risks in addition or as incidental to such transit, and includes any other risks customarily included among the risks insured against in marine insurance policies” 21.    It is the consistent argument by Levi that the provisions of the Nationalization Act obligate it to cover its risks through a domestic policy. Section 25 of the Nationalization Act, is as follows: "25. Properties in India not to be insured with foreign insurers except with permission of Central Government.-- (1) No person shall take out or renew any policy of insurance in respect of any property in India or any ship or other vessel or aircraft registered in India with an insurer whose principal place of business is outside India save with the prior permission of the Central Government. (2) If any person contravenes any provision of sub-section (1), he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both." Relevant provisions of the STP policy and the SFSP policy 22.    The relevant provisions of the STP Policy are extracted below: Levi Strauss & Co. (and Majestic Insurance International Ltd. as a reassured where applicable) and/or subsidiaries and/or associated and/or affiliated controlled companies or corporations as may now exist or may hereafter be formed or acquired, any companies or corporations over which the Assured exercises management control and/or for whom they have authority to insure. Hereinafter referred to as the Assured (For account of whom it may concern) (1)     In consideration of premium to be paid at rates to be agreed, insurance herein covers all shipments of goods and/or merchandise of every kind and description, (including, but not limited to, raw stock, materials, stock and goods in process, finished goods and packaging materials), machinery, equipment, spare parts and shipping containers, freight and all other interests incidental to the Assured's business, lost or not lost, by any conveyance including                             any                             connecting conveyances between ports and/or places throughout the world, including (2)     This policy covers continuously while in transit, from the time of commencement of transit until delivery to ultimate destination without limitation of time (except as may be specifically excluded elsewhere herein) notwithstanding the Warehouse to Warehouse Clause and Marine Extension B.        This insurance to cover all shipments, whether made by the Assured, or its agents, or by others for its account or in which it may have an insurable interest; also shipments belonging to others, which the Assured has instructions, or is under obligation (whether by arrangements, understandings, agreements or otherwise) or has a right to insure. C.        To take all insurances attaching hereto during the period from 1st May, 2008 to 30th April, 2009, both days inclusive, Local Standard Time, at the place the shipment commences and, on all goods, and/or merchandise and/or property in storage at locations insured under this policy. Goods and/or merchandise and/or cargo of every description incidental to the Assured's business as may be declared. Consisting principally of, but not limited to, raw stock, materials, stock, goods in process, finished goods etc. and similar property of others for which the Assured is liable and/or duty and/or freight and/or insurance and/or interest and/or advances and/or charges. Coverage hereunder includes whilst in transit and/or in store or elsewhere, including whilst at retail locations. USD 10,000,000 any one vessel and/or conveyance USD 50,000,000 any one location and in the aggregate per annum in respect of earthquake (first loss). But in respect of Retail Locations USD 5,000,000 any one Retail Location and in the aggregate per annum in respect of earthquake This insurance attaches from the time the goods leave the warehouse at the place named in the policy or certificate or declaration for the commencement of the transit and continues until the goods are delivered to the final warehouse at the destination named in the policy or certificate or declaration, or a substituted destination as provided in Clause 7.B hereunder. In case the interest hereby insured is covered by other insurance (except as hereinafter provided) the loss shall be collected from the several policies in the order of the date of their attachment, insurance attaching on the same date to be deemed simultaneous and to contribute pro rata; provided, however, that where any fire insurance, or any insurance (including fire) taken out by any carrier or bailee is available to the beneficiary of this policy, or would be so available if this insurance did not exist, then this insurance shall be void to the extent that such other insurance is or would have been available. It is agreed, nevertheless, that where these Assurers are thus relieved of because of the existence of other insurance, these Assurers shall receive and the premium payable under this policy and, in consideration thereof, shall guarantee the solvency of the companies and/or underwriters who issued such other insurance and the prompt collection of the loss hereunder to the same extent (only) as these Assurers shall have been relieved of liability under the terms of this clause, but not exceeding, in any case, the amount which would have been collectible under this policy if such other insurance did not exist. It is agreed that where the Assured or any of their Associated, Affiliated or Companies or Partners are obligated by legislation or otherwise to arrange insurance locally, they shall continue to have the full benefit of these insurances in respect to difference in perils insured, definitions, conditions and/or limits of liability.” “Policy covers various loss or damage caused on account of fire (excluding destruction or damage caused to the property insured by: a) i) its own termination, natural heating or spontaneous combustion ii) its undergoing any heating or drying process. b) burning of property insured by order of any Public Authority. “9. Loss of earnings, loss by delay, loss of market or other consequential or indirect loss or damage of any kind or description whatever.” Condition No. 4 which is material for the purpose of deciding this case is “4. This insurance does not cover any loss or damage to property which, at the time of the happening of such loss or damage, it insured by or would, but for the existence of this policy, be insured by any marine policy or policies had this insurance not been effected”. 24.    The fire incident took place on 13.07.2008. Levi’s goods were stored in the warehouse of Safexpress. There is no dispute that the fire incident was reported immediately. On 22.07.2008 and 23.07.2008, the premises were visited by authorized representative of Kaypsens & McLarens Young International, Surveyor & Loss Assessor for final survey to value the loss caused by the fire at the premises. They were nominated by Allianz. Pursuant to that visit, a Status Report dated 28.07.008 was prepared setting out the details of the accident and losses incurred. Subsequently the premises were once again inspected on 07.08.2008 and 08.08.2008, pursuant to which a Second Status Report was made on 11.08.2008. In the meanwhile, on receipt of the fire accident intimation the insurer appointed M/s Professional Surveyors and Loss Adjusters Pvt. Ltd. for survey and assessment of loss submitted their final Survey Report on 08.08.2009. The surveyor assessed the loss for ₹ 11.34 crores. So far as the claim’s admissibility is concerned, the surveyor noticed the two policies issued by Allianz, Clauses 41 and 47 of the STP Policy, and Condition No. 4 of the SFSP policy, and stated that in its opinion the insurer “had no liability in respect of the captioned claim, in view of the Global Marine Policy.” The relevant observations a. The Insured's Parent Company M/s Levi Strauss & Co., has two Insurance Policies, one Companies Marine policy covering the goods worldwide and while at locations worldwide for storage, processing or packaging or otherwise, on First Loss basis for an amount of USD 50,000,000 for any one location, as. per Endorsement No: 2 - Storage/Inventory/Processing Coverage. Clause 41 - Other Insurance Clause - also provides for pro-rata contribution along with all other insurance-policies. This policy has been taken from Allianz Global Risks. b. The other Policy taken by the Parent is a Commercial Lines Policy from Allianz Global Risks US Insurance Company. This policy also covers goods worldwide upto a loss limit of USD 100,000,000/= per location. This Policy also has a Standard Fire Bay Provisions Endorsement which mentions “Pro- rata Liability”. c. According to Condilion No: 4 of the SFSP Policy issued by UIC, “The Insurance does nol cover any loss or damage to property which, at the time of happening of such loss or damage, is insured by or would but for the existence of this policy, be insured by any marine policy or policies except in respect of any excess beyond the amount which would have been payable under the marine policy or policies’ had this, insurance not been effected.” d. Therefore, in our opinion, UIIC has no. lability in respect of the captioned claim, in view of the Global Marine Policy.” Eventually, the insurer, on 11.09.2009, repudiated the claim. In the meanwhile, even before that event, on 18.07.2009, the insurer had intimated to Levi that by virtue of Condition No. 4 of the SFSP policy, since the risk was covered by another policy, that fact had to be considered. 25.     The complaint before the NCDRC claimed the sum of ₹ 9.08 crores along with interest @ 18% calculated from the date of claim to the date of payment. It was in these proceedings, for the first time, that Levi disclosed that it received amounts in satisfaction of its claims under the STP Policy issued by Allianz. It was submitted that the position with regard to the losses incurred by Levi as on date of the complaint was that the total inventory loss was $ 7.01 million. Under the STP Policy issued by Allianz to Levi’s parent company, US $4.54 million had already been paid to the parent company. Levi claimed that this was amount in excess to the claim made by it under the SFSP Policy on “Difference in Conditions” basis. Levi, therefore, claimed it was entitled to receive $ 1.97 million (~ ₹ 9.08 crores) under the SFSP Policy plus interest for inventory losses caused by the fire. The insurer resisted, arguing that by virtue of a co-joint reading of Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy, and Clause 47 of the STP Policy, it was not liable. 26.     NCDRC, in its impugned order, repelled the insurer’s contention, holding firstly that Condition No. 4 could operate only if the other policy (i.e., one issued by Allianz) was a marine policy. The NCDRC did not decide this issue. The impugned order next held that by reason of Section 25 of the Nationalization Act, Levi was obligated to cover its risks through a domestic policy and therefore the condition in Clause 47 of the STP Policy, it was entitled to the full benefit of the SFSP Policy. It was lastly held that the claimant was entitled to the amount of loss constituting the difference between the pay out by Allianz and the value of the goods. 27.      In the light of the above facts, the first question which this Court has to decide is regarding the nature of the STP Policy issued by Allianz. The insurer asserts that it was a marine policy. However, the NCDRC has held otherwise. 28.      This Court has, in a previous section of this judgment, noted relevant provisions of the Marine Insurance Act. The expression “marine adventure” is defined by Section 2(d). Similarly, “maritime peril” referred to in “marine adventure” is defined in Section 2(e). Section 3 defines a marine policy; Section 4, which is relevant for this case, deals with mixed marine and land risks. It inter alia, enables coverage – through “express terms, or by usage of trade” – extension of marine policies “so as to protect the assured against losses on inland waters or on any land risk which may be incidental to any sea voyage.” 29.      In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Hira Lal Ramesh Chand & Ors3 this court described a marine policy as follows: “14. Marine Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the assured in the manner and to the extent thereby agreed, against marine losses, that is to say losses incident to marine adventure. The instrument in which the contract of marine insurance is generally embodied is called a policy. The thing or property insured is called the subject matter of insurance and the assured's interest in that subject matter is called his insurable interest. That which is insured against is the loss arising from maritime perils and casualties, and these are called the perils insured against or the losses covered by the policy. When the insurer's liability commences under the contract, the policy is said to attach; or in other words, the risk is said to attach or to begin to run from that time. A marine insurance cover applies to the shipment and if the shipment reaches the destination, in a safe and sound condition, no claim can arise against the insurer. A contract of marine insurance may, however, by its express terms or by trade usage, be extended so as to protect the assured against losses on inland waters or against any land risk which may be incidental to a sea voyage. (Vide Sections 3 & 4 of Marine Insurance Act, 1963 and Halsbury's Law of England, 4th Edition, Vol.25 paras 216 and 218). 30.      Warehouse risks, combined with voyage and other marine risks, are considered as part of marine insurance policies in India. This has been held in Peacock Plywood Pvt. Ltd. v. The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd4; United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd 5. In Hira Lal (supra), this Court, after considering Section 4 of the Marine Insurance Act, held as follows: “17. In view of the insurance cover extending `warehouse to warehouse' the consignments are covered by insurance not only during the sea journey, but beyond as stated in the policy. Therefore, the contention of the insurer that the insurance cover is available only in regard to maritime perils that is perils relating to or incidental to the navigation of the sea may not be correct. Having regard to Section 4 of the Marine Insurance Act and the terms of the policy undertaking insurance cover against wider risks, the policy of insurance would cover the loss not only while goods or navigating the sea but also any loss or damage during transit from the time it leaves the consignor's warehouse till it reaches the consignee's warehouse. The cover against risks will however cease on the expiry of 60 days after discharge of the consignment from the vessel at the final port of discharge, if the goods do not reach the consignee's warehouse or place of storage for any reason within the said 60 days.” 31.      In the present case, the first two recitals of the STP Policy, as well as the warehouse-to-warehouse transit (Clause 6) and other stipulations clearly state that the policy covers both marine and other risks. An express condition is that “Coverage hereunder includes whilst in transit and/or in store or elsewhere, including whilst at retail locations. USD 10,000,000 any one vessel and/or conveyance USD 50,000,000 any one location and in the aggregate per annum in respect of earthquake (first loss). But in respect of Retail Locations USD 5,000,000 any one Retail Location and in the aggregate per annum in respect of earthquake.” In fact, the STP describes itself as “OPEN MARINE INSURANCE 32.      In view of these materials, it is clear that the STP Policy was a marine policy which comprehensively covered voyage, transit, transportation and warehouse perils. As can be seen from the description of the policy, and other express stipulations, all kinds of risks, including marine risks were covered. In fact, different limits for “retail locations” were provided; further Clause 6 also extended to warehouse risks. In these circumstances, and having regard to the law declared by this Court, what is material is not whether the insurable event occurred during the voyage; rather, the focus is on the nature of the cover. The cover in this case, clearly and unequivocally included marine perils. Therefore, it was a marine cover. 33.      Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy, which constituted a contract between the parties, precisely contemplated a situation whereby in the event of occurrence of an insurance risk, if Levi (or someone on its behalf, like in the present case the parent company) was entitled to claim under a marine policy, the insurer was not to be held liable. 34.      In Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. v. Garg Sons International6, this Court held: “The insured cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the insurance policy. The terms of the contract have to be construed strictly, without altering the nature of the contract as the same may affect the interests of the parties adversely. The clauses of an insurance policy have to be read as they are. Consequently, the terms of the insurance policy, that fix the responsibility of the insurance company must also be read strictly. The contract must be read as a whole and every attempt should be made to harmonise the terms thereof, keeping in mind that the Rule of contra proferentem does not apply in case of commercial contract, for the reason that a Clause in a commercial contract is bilateral and has mutually been agreed upon. (Vide Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sony Cheriyan [ (1999) 6 SCC 451], Polymat India (P) Ltd. v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. (2005) 9 SCC 174], Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. ONGC Ltd. (2010) 11 SCC 296 and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Dewan 35.      Similar views about the nature of insurance contracts and the principles of their interpretation were expressed in Vikram Greentech India Ltd v New India Assurance Co.7 and Sikka Papers Ltd v National Insurance Co8. It has been held recently, in Impact Funding Solutions Ltd. v. Barrington Support Services Ltd.9 “As a matter of general principle, it is well established that if one party, otherwise liable, wishes to exclude or limit his liability to the other party, he must do so in clear words; and that the contract should be given the meaning it would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which is reasonably available to the person or class of persons to whom the document is addressed... This applies not only where the words of exception remove a remedy for breach, but where they seek to prevent a liability from arising by removing, through a subsidiary provision, part of the benefit which it appears to have been the purpose of the contract to provide.” 36.      In the light of the above discussion, on a plain and reasonable construction of Condition No. 4 of the SFSP policy, that once it is established that Levi – or on its behalf, in this case, its parent company – was covered for the risk under a marine policy, (the STP Policy) and was entitled to claim under it, the appellant insurer’s liability was excluded. Therefore, on a plain construction of the terms of the policy issued by Allianz, it was a marine policy. Therefore, Condition No. 4 operated to exclude the insurer’s liability. 37.      Clause 47 of the STP Policy issued by Allianz stated that the assured (i.e., Levi’s parent company) “or any of their Associated, Affiliated or Companies or Partners are obligated by legislation or otherwise to arrange insurance locally”. 38.      The second question which arises for consideration is what is the meaning of the term “obligated by legislation” This expression is an integral part of Clause [2016] UKSC 57. This judgment was followed in New India Assurance Company Limited and Ors. vs. Rajeshwar 47 of the STP Policy. An overall reading of that condition bears out the intention of the parties that regardless of whether domestic legislation in a particular country mandates the taking out of a policy issued by local insurer, the global insurer, i.e., Allianz would still continue to be liable. This is clear from the latter part of the condition, “they shall continue to have the full benefit of this insurance in reference to the difference in the insured, definitions, conditions and/or limits of liability.” 39.       It is clear that if and only if the insured, i.e., Levi, is obligated by law, i.e., required to have some form of mandatory insurance by virtue of express provisions of law that the particular stipulation would operate to the extent of ‘difference’, Levi would be entitled to claim from Alliance. The expression “obligated by law” has to be understood in the context as mandatory. 40.       According to Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases10: "Obligation" is a word of his own nature of a large extent; but it is commonly taken in the common law, for a bond containing penalty, with condition for payment of money or to do or suffer some act or thing, etc. and a bill is most commonly taken for a single bond without condition. The person bound is the "obligor"; the other party is the "obligee". See Ryland Vs. Delisle L.R. 3 P.C 17 The word "obligation" primarily means a tie. Legally it was in origin the binding tie established by what is called a "bond" as between obligor and obligee. [Watkinson Vs. Hoolington (1944) K.B 16, 21 (Scott L.J.)] "Oblige" :- A person is "obliged" to do a thing when placed in such circumstances that he can scarcely help it; e.g. a constable who has been suspended and on whom an inquiry has been ordered, and who thereupon sends his resignation, has been "obliged to resign", within the rules of a pension fund (Lapointe Vs. L'Association de Retraite, Montreal [1906] A.C. 535)” P. Ramanatha Iyer’s Advanced Law Lexicon11 explains the term: “"Obligate" means to bring or place under obligation; to bring or firmly hold to an act. "Obligated" means strictly, and in common parlance, to be bound. Ninth Edition (2016) Vol. II pg. 1691. "Obligatio" denotes not merely the passive duty imposed upon the obligor but also the relationship between the obligor and the obligee such as that between debtor and his creditor. It is that legal relationship subsisting between two persons by which one is bound to the other for a certain performance. "obligatio civilis" means an obligation enforceable by action, whether it derives its origin from the jus civile, as the obligation engendered by formal contracts or the obligation enforceable by bilaterally penal suits, or from such portion of the jus gentium as has been completely naturalized in the civil law and protected by all its remedies, such as obligation engendered by formless contracts.” According to Black's Law Dictionary12: "Obligation is a legal or moral duty to do or not to do something". "Legal obligation" has wide and varied meanings. It may refer to anything that a person is bound to do or forbear from doing, whether the duty is imposed by law, contract, promise, social relations, courtesy, kindness or morality.” 41.       It is therefore evident from the above discussion that there should be a mandate in law or in contract or by contract (which is covered by the expression “or otherwise”). The argument on behalf of Levi was that Section 25 prohibits the foreign insurers from taking or bringing any policy of insurance in respect of any property in India and as a result it was compelled to take out the SFSP Policy. If the plain meaning of the expression “obligated by law” or “obliged by law” is to be understood, there should be an express requirement in law, which compels the insured to obtain a policy. There are provisions in specific legislations in this regard, such as the Motor Vehicles Act, 198813; the Merchant Shipping Act, 195814; Carriage by Air Act, 197215 and the Public Liability Insurance Act, 199116, etc. The conditions spelt out in these specific instances compel entities and business to obtain specific kinds of insurance policies to cover particular Section 4A read with Para 50, Chapter VI, Third Schedule to the Act. Section 4 imposes a duty on owners of establishments involved in hazardous industries, to take out insurance 42.    In this case, it is not Levi’s position that there exists any legislation which compelled it to obtain insurance to cover risks which it sought to get covered by the SFSP Policy. In this context, a mere prohibition in Section 25 of the Nationalization Act clearly did not apply to Levi’s parent company, which conducts business overseas (and not only in India) and obtain a marine cover which catered to all risks, (including marine risks as well as risks to the goods in transit and when they were warehoused). Therefore, the prohibition in Section 25 per se does not apply. Equally, there was no specific provision requiring Levi to obtain a domestic policy, in the conduct of its business. The NCDRC, in this Court’s opinion, was clearly wrong in holding that Clause 47 applied and it had to be read in the way it was. Interpretation of Clause 6 and 41 of STP Policy and Condition No. 4 of SFSP 43.    As concluded in the first section of the analysis of this judgment, Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy clearly excluded the insurer’s liability in the event Levi could collect amounts under another insurance policy for the same risk. Clause 6 of the STP Policy as well as the recitals (noted earlier) point to the fact that a comprehensive overall coverage was envisioned by Levi’s parent company. That comprehensive risk included fire risks at the various warehouses where different subsidiaries, including Levi (insured in this case) had stored its goods. The surveyors appointed by Allianz, Mr. K.P. Sen, prepared and submitted two reports. In the final report, according to the assessment made, two alternatives were provided. In the first one, the value of the goods was affected by the fire incidents after deduction for 2.5% for obsolete desktops and the value of net realization of salvage at actuals was fixed at ₹ 11.10 crores. According to the second alternative, which was on sale cost basis, again, after taking 2.5% for obsolete/dead stocks and subtracting net realization of salvage value at actual cost, the next cost at net sale basis was assessed at ₹ 15.30 crores. Initially, the assessment (in terms of the documents placed on the record) was $3.60 million as on 19.08.2008. This report took note of a plausible claim by Levi upon the insurer. The subsequent supplementary report which provided global claims services to Levi’s parent company dated 03.10.2008 indicated that “based on present information”, it stated that the loss reserves should be increased to $4.5 million. It further stated that upon review, MYI calculation of inventory at wholesale selling price loss salvage value was $6.85 million. In these circumstances, finally, the sum of $ 4.54 million was paid out ($ 3 million plus ~$ 1.54 million). 44.    A plain reading of Clause 41 of STP Policy shows that where fire insurance or any insurance which was taken out by the carrier was available to the beneficiary, i.e., Levi, or ‘would be so available’ if the STP did not exist, then a claim under that policy, i.e., STP Policy would not be maintained and the insurance would be void to that extent. There is nothing on the record to show that any carrier or bailee in this case made a claim upon Alliance or any other insurer to recover possible liability in furtherance of any policy. What has been established from the record is that the sum of $4.54 million was in fact disbursed to Levi as admitted liability by Allianz. In the circumstances, clearly, Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy operated and excluded the appellant-insurer’s liability. 45.    What is in issue in this present case has been characterized as “double insurance”, i.e., where an entity seeks to cover risks for the same or similar incidents through two different - overlapping policies. There is a wealth of international jurisprudence on the various nuances of double insurance. Such double insurance is per se not frowned upon in law. The courts however, adopt a careful approach in considering policies which seeks to exclude liability on the part of the insurer. 46.        The celebrated commentary on insurance, Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance, has this to say on double insurance - 17: Pg. 12-130: General definition. Double insurance arises where two or more independent insurers cover the same interest against the same risk, that is, there is a common liability18. As a matter of principle, it is clear that there cannot be double insurance unless there is in existence more than on valid policy attaching to the same interest. There is, for example, no double insurance where one policy is substituted for another19. For there to be double insurance the policies need not be identical but may cover different subjects and different risks as well as the risk covered in common, but what is essential is that a common liability to indemnify the same assured in respect of a specified loss must exist. The loss which more than one insurer is liable to make good must be identical, so that payment of a claim by one insurer will provide a co-insurer with a defence to a like claim against it. In other words, two or more insurers must have insured the same assured in respect of the same risk on the same interest in the same subject-matter.20 Pg. 12-131: Same assured and same interest Double insurance arises only where both policies cover the subject-matter which has been the subject of the loss. This is essentially a matter of construction of each of the policies. Thus, in Baag v Economic Insurance Co Ltd21 it was held that a lorry-load of cigarettes insured under an all-risks transit policy did not form part of the assured's stock in trade at a factory at which the load had been temporarily stored, so that the fire insurers of the factory were not liable to contribute towards payments made by the all-risks insurers on the destruction of the factory and the load by fire.” Pg. 12-132: Same assured and same interest. Generally, double insurance arises where the same assured possesses two overlapping policies, although there could potentially be double insurance where two assureds with the same interest in the subject-matter insured that interest. It is more likely, however, that different assureds will have different interests in the insured subject-matter, and there is no double insurance in that situation because each assured is insuring his own interest. Typical illustrations include concurrent interests in Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance 12th edition Sweet & Maxwell (2019) Ed. Robert Merkin See generally, Albion Insurance Co Ltd v GIO (NSW) (1969) 121 C.L.R. 342. In Equity Syndicate Management Ltd v Glaxosmithkline Plc [2015] EWHC 2163 (Comm); [2016] Lloyd’s Rep. I.R. 155 a motor policy which by its terms covered a claim by an employee driving a hired car was rectified to accord with the parties’ common intention, so that the risk was borne solely by a policy designed to cover such risks and there was no double Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd v Martin (1866) 35 L.J.C. P. 181. See also QBE Insurance (International) Ltd v Allianz Australia Ltd [2018] NZCA 239, where the second policy was held to incept on the termination of the first, so that there was no overlapping cover.

QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd v Westfarmers General Insurance Ltd [2010] land held by vendor and purchaser,22 landlord and tenant,23 employer and contractor, or mortgagor and mortgagee,24 and concurrent interests in goods held by bailor and bailee.25 Equally, there is no double insurance between a primary policy and a subsequent excess of loss policy26 or between a primary policy and an increased value policy.27” 47.       Similarly, Mac Gillvray on Insurance Law28 has this to say: “There is high appellate authority29 for preferring the reasoning in the Eagle Star case to that in Legal & General on the ground that an insurer should be able to rely on policy defences to a claim by the assured in answer to a claim for contribution. It is very respectfully submitted that Legal & General should prevail. If an insurer can defeat a claim for contribution by reliance upon defences to his liability to the assured arising after the loss, this will strike at the foundations of the doctrine. First, once the first insurer has paid a complete indemnity to the assured, the second insurer would be entitled to decline liability to the assured on the ground that he has been fully indemnified30, although the payment is the basis of the equity between the two insurers. Secondly, it would be possible for the second insurer to defeat the claim for contribution by agreeing with the assured to cancel the second policy after the first insurer had paid a complete indemnity, contrary to the decision in O'Kane v Jones, The 48.       In National Employers Mutual General Insurance Association v Haydon32, ‘S’, a firm of solicitors was insured by ‘P’ under a policy, renewable annually; that policy excluded indemnification where the claimant was doubly insured. It however covered claims arising after expiration, if due notice was given of the likelihood of the claim before the policy expired. The claimant was later insured Davjoyda Estates Pty Ltd v National Insurance Co of NZ Ltd (1965) 69 S.R. (NSW) 381. Portavon Cinema v Price [1939] All E.R. 601.

Drake insurance Co. Austin v. Zurich General Accident & Liability Insurance Co. [1945] KB 250 at 258; AMP Workers’ Compensation v. QBE Insurance [2001] NSWCA 267, stating – “The right of contribution cannot depend upon the continued existence of co-ordinate liabilities for the same demand because the very payment which calls the right into existence will have put an end to the liablility of the other insurance.” O’Kane v. Jones, the Martin P [2004] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 389, where the court held it was bound by precedent to follow Legal & General Assurance Society v. Drake Insurance Co. [1992] QB 887 at [201]-[202]. by another insurer under a policy with similar double insurance provisions and excluding cover for prior claims. S gave notice to P of a future claim in due time. P claimed a contribution from D, on the ground that this claim was a case of double insurance. It was held that “Where each of two insurers agrees to an indemnity payable under one policy, unless it is payable under another policy, neither insurer can prove that he is not liable; therefore both insurers are liable and there is a true event of double insurance. In my judgment, however, the principle of Weddell's case as to the sharing of liability only applies if an indemnity is payable under both policies. A clause of express absolution from one policy by reference to another only applies if there is another policy which indemnifies against the same risk. If this were not the case, an unfortunate insured could fail to recover against the first insurer because of the existence of the second policy, but fail to recover under the second policy because the risk had not been accepted by the second insurer. If only one insurer is liable the insured can claim the whole.” 49.      In the present case, the facts are that the only claim preferred by Levi with the insurer on 18.07.2008 was for ₹ 12.2 crores. There is no material on the record to show that during the subsistence of the policy issued by the parent insurer, it was ever notified by Levi about the existence of the policy issued by Allianz. The final report of the surveyors appointed by the appellant insurer assessed the total loss at ₹ 11.70 crores. However, it also stated that as Levi’s parent company had obtained another policy under which the loss was to be recovered, the claim was inadmissible because of Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy. It is also a matter of record that as against the claim of ₹12.2 crores made upon the insurer in this case, Levi ultimately received equivalent of over ₹19 crores. 50.      A contract of insurance is and always continues to be one for indemnity of the defined loss, no more no less. In the case of specific risks, such as those arising from loss due to fire, etc., the insured cannot profit and take advantage by double insurance. Long ago, Brett LJ in Castettion v Preston33 said that: “The contract of insurance … is a contract of indemnity, …, and this contract means that the assured, in the case of a loss …, shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully indemnified.” 51.    Levi could not have claimed more than what it did, and not in any case, more than what it received from Allianz. Its endeavour to distinguish between the STP Policy and the SFSP Policy, i.e., that the former covered loss of profits, and the latter, the value of manufactured goods, is not borne out on an interpretation of the terms of the two policies. Even the facts here clearly show that Levi received substantial amounts towards the sale price of its damaged goods, over and above the manufacturing costs. 52.    In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal has to succeed; the impugned order of NCDRC is hereby set aside. Levi’s complaint is dismissed; consequently, the appeal is allowed.

She is also the petitioner in Criminal Petition No.7026/2019.             A charge sheet    was    filed  by    respondent      No.1-Police     in  Crime No.400/2015, for the offences punishable under Sections 302, 493, 494, 496, 120-B, 201 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `IPC').     An application under Section 227 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `Cr.P.C.'), filed by said Smt.Mamatha R., (accused No.3) in S.C.No.20/2017, pending in the Court of learned V Addl.District & Sessions Judge, Mandya (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `Sessions Judge's Court'), came to be allowed by the order of the Sessions Judge's Court dated 04.08.2017 and accused No.3 came to be discharged for the offences above mentioned. 2. Challenging the said order, CW-2 K.C.Ramu @ Ramanna, the father of the deceased K.R.Manjunatha and father-in-law of accused No.3-Smt.Mamatha R., has filed Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018, under Section 397(1) read with Section 401 of Cr.P.C. Very same CW-2 K.C.Ramu @ Ramanna has filed Criminal Petition No.711/2018, under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking a direction to any other investigating authority to investigate  the    case  in  Crime No.400/2015,      which   is later numbered as S.C.No.20/2017 pending in the Sessions After the discharge of accused No.3 by the Sessions Judge's   Court  vide   its order  dated    04.08.2017,      the complainant-State has filed an application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. on 22.08.2019. The Sessions Judge's Court issued summons to the said Smt.Mamatha R., on the application. Aggrieved by the said order of the Sessions Judge's Court, said   Smt.Mamatha      R.,  has   filed   Criminal     Petition No.7026/2019 under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. 3. The respondent No.1-State is being represented by learned High Court Government Pleader.       The respondent- Smt.Mamatha R., is being represented by her counsel. 4. The records in S.C.No.20/2017 were called for and the same are placed before this Court. 5. Since all these matters have arisen out of the very same Sessions Case No.20/2017, all these matters are connected with each other and taken up to hear the common arguments and to pass a common order. 6. Heard the arguments from both side.             Perused the materials placed before this Court. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the trial Court. 7. After hearing both side, the points that arise for my consideration are,- (1) Whether the order dated 04.08.2017, passed in S.C.No.20/2017 by the Sessions Judge's Court is perverse warranting interference at the hands of this deserves    to be    allowed   with a   direction    for an investigating agency other than the Karnataka State Police to investigate in Crime No.400/2015 in the 1st respondent-Police Station? (3) Whether the order dated 22.08.2019, passed in S.C.No.20/2017 by the Sessions Judge's Court ordering issuance of summons to the proposed accused No.3 therein deserves to be set aside? 8. The case of prosecution is that, on 25.08.2015, in the afternoon, the respondent-Police received an information about the presence of a dead body near V.C. canal, which was closed to Kalenahalli. The police after visiting the spot, taken out the dead body and noticed that it had piercing injuries on the back of the head and stomach and also the legs, hands and neck of the dead body were tied with a rope. Thereafter, on the same day, at about 5.30 p.m., upon an information of one Sri H.Anand Kumar, the Police Officer, Crime No.400/2015 came to be registered in the respondent- Police Station against unknown persons for the offences punishable    under   Sections     302,   201    of   IPC.      After investigation,   the   respondent-Police     filed   charge    sheet against the three accused, including Smt.Mamatha R., the petitioner in Criminal Petition No.7026/2019, for the above said offences. 9. The summary of the charge sheet is that the deceased     was  one   Sri K.R.Manjunatha.         He    married accused No.3 Smt.Mamatha R., on 04.03.2009. Out of their marriage, they got a girl child by name Bhandavya. On the date 09.10.2013, deceased K.R.Manjunatha left his house. Thereafter, his whereabouts were not known till 2015. When said K.R.Manjunatha returned back to his house in April 2015, he came to know that his wife Mamatha R., (accused No.3), had married to accused No.1 Manjunath Y.D. @ Sketch Manju @ Manju. The deceased K.R.Manjunatha had requested said accused No.1 to give the custody of his daughter Bhandavya back to him.         The accused No.1 and accused No.3 thinking that so long deceased K.R.Manjunatha is alive, they wont have peace in life, hatched a conspiracy to cause his death. Accordingly, accused No.1 engaged accused No.2 to kill K.R.Manjunatha. Accordingly, accused Nos.1 and 2 took the deceased K.R.Manjunatha with them and made him to consume liquor and put him in a car and caused his murder by inflicting multiple pierce injuries upon him with a knife and in order to destroy the evidence of the incident, took the dead body in the same car for some more distance and threw it in V.C. canal near Hulikere.     Thus, they have committed the alleged offence. 10. Learned counsel for the petitioner in Criminal Revision   Petition   No.206/2018     and   Criminal     Petition No.711/2018 in his argument submitted that CW-30 – Smt.Lakshmi, the mother of the deceased, apart from giving the details of the marital life of the deceased with accused No.3, has also stated about the second marriage of accused No.3 with accused No.1 and has specifically expressed her suspicion that accused No.1 and accused No.3 with the help of others, have taken her son some where, killed him and dumped his body in V.C. canal.      He further submitted that CW-31 Nataraj, the friend of the deceased also spoken about the marital life of accused No.1 with accused No.3 and the second marriage of accused No.3 with accused No.1. He too has expressed his belief that accused No.3 was involved in the death of the deceased. Learned counsel further submitted that CW-8 Sukanya is the neighbour of accused Nos.1 and 3 and she has also spoken about she seeing accused No.1 and accused No.3 living together as her neighbour as husband and wife. 11. These evidences clearly make out a prima facie case that accused No.3, apart from marrying with accused No.1, has also involved in the commission of the murder of her first husband deceased K.R.Manjunatha. However, the trial Court opining that the offence punishable under Section 494 of IPC cannot be investigated by the police and it could not notice any tangible material to attract Section 120-B of IPC, has allowed the application filed by accused No.3 filed under Section 227 of Cr.P.C., which is erroneous, as such, the Criminal Revision Petition deserves to be allowed. He   further   submitted    that   during   the    course     of investigation, the Investigating Officer since has not recorded the statement of Bhandavya, the daughter of the deceased and accused No.3, the investigation has not been done properly,   as   such,  further    investigation   to   record    the statement of said Bhandavya is required, for which, Criminal Petition No.711/2018 deserves to be allowed. 12. Learned counsel for respondent No.2 in Criminal and for the petitioner in Criminal Petition No.7026/2019 i.e., for accused No.3, in his argument submitted that none of the charge sheet witnesses have stated         about the involvement of accused No.3 in the alleged commission of crime.             There are no proof for the second marriage between accused Nos.1 and 3. Further stating that if Criminal Revision Petition is allowed, his Criminal Petition No.7026/2019 becomes infructuous, learned counsel  prayed    for dismissal    of Criminal   Revision    Petition No.206/2018 and Criminal Petition No.711/2018. 13. Learned High Court Government Pleader who was directed to file his written arguments, has filed his written arguments, wherein he has contended that there are ample materials to prosecute accused No.3 for the offences. There are sufficient materials to show that she had undergone second marriage with accused No.1 and hatched a conspiracy to eliminate her first husband deceased K.R.Manjunatha. It is further stated by the     learned High Court Government Pleader that since the State did not challenge the order of the trial Court   allowing the IA. filed by   accused No.3 under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. and after recording of evidence of few witnesses, it noticed that there are incriminating materials against accused No.3, as such, the prosecution filed an application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. in the trial Court, upon which, the summons has been ordered against accused No.3.    He orally submitted that if the Criminal Revision Petition, which he supports, is allowed, his application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. pending in the trial Court become 14. The deceased K.R.Manjunatha married the original accused No.3 Smt.Mamatha R., on 04.03.2009. The couple got a small child born to them out of their wedlock by name Bhandavya and the said child was aged about six years as on the date of the alleged incident.   Said K.R.Manjunatha was said to have left his house without intimation to anybody due to the debt incurred for his vices.    After lodging the police complaint, said K.R.Manjunatha was said to have traced by the police.  His father K.C.Ramu (CW-2) was said to have cleared his debts. CW-2 is also shown to have stated that, at the instance of his second son,     K.R.Mahesha (CW-3), the family property was said to be partitioned.        The property going to the share of deceased K.R.Manjunatha is shown to have been made in the name of his daughter Bhandavya. According to CW-2, once again on 09.10.2013, his son K.R.Manjunatha was found missing, in which connection, a complaint was lodged with the police on 15.11.2013.         His wife i.e., Smt.Mamatha R., and their daughter Bhandavya were started living in the house of CW-2. However, later at the instance of maternal uncle of said Mamatha R., the said Mamatha R., (original accused No.3) was shown to have married to accused No.1 Y.D.Manjunatha.         Later in April 2015, K.R.Manjunatha, the missing person, was said to have returned to his house and after coming to know that his wife Mamatha R., had married to accused No.1 and was residing with him, he started seeking the custody of his daughter Bhandavya from her. It is in that connection, in order to get rid of K.R.Manjunatha, who was frequently visiting accused Nos.1 and 3 and pestering them to give custody of his daughter   Bhandavya,    all the  three   accused,    including Mamatha R., hatched a conspiracy and killed K.R.Manjunatha and threw his dead body into V.C. canal. The father of the deceased i.e., CW-2 K.C.Ramu, brother of the deceased i.e., CW-3 K.R.Mahesha, mother of the deceased CW-30 Smt.Lakshmi, are shown to have given their statements before the Investigating Officer on the above lines. 15. Apart from the above witnesses, CW-4 Papanna, CW-5 Thimmegowda and CW-6 Shivanna, are shown to have stated before the Investigating Officer about the second marriage of Mamatha R. (original accused No.3) with accused No.1. CW-8 Sukanya is shown to have stated before the Investigating Officer that accused No.1 and accused No.3 Mamatha R., were residing together as her neighbour. Apart from these witnesses, CW-22 Nandisha, who is none else than the elder brother of Mamatha R. (accused No.3) is also shown to have stated about they performing the second marriage of Mamatha R. with accused No.1. 16. The charge sheet witnesses in the additional charge sheet CW-42 K.B.Prakash is shown to have given his statement stating that it was him who as a Purohit, performed the marriage of accused No.1 and Mamatha R. CW-43 S. Siddesh and CW-44         K.B. Kumaraswamy in the additional charge sheet are shown to have given their statement stating that both of them have attended the marriage of Mamatha R., (accused No.3) with accused No.1. Thus, at this stage, there are ample materials to prosecute original accused No.3 Mamatha R. for the offence punishable under Section 494 of IPC. The Sessions Judge's Court observing that an offence punishable under Section 494 of IPC cannot be investigated by the police, has proceeded to ignore the ample materials available before it to prosecute accused No.3 Mamatha R., for the alleged offence. 17. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner relying upon     the   judgment      of    Hon'ble   Apex      Court    in State of Orissa –vs- Sharat Chandra Sahu and another, reported in (1996) 6 SCC 435, submitted that police are not debarred from investigating non-cognizable cases and include them in the charge sheet, more particularly, Section 494 of In Sharat Chandra Sahu's case (supra), the police had filed a charge sheet for the offence punishable under Section 498-A of IPC as also under Section 494 of IPC.                The respondent No.1 therein filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. before the Orissa High Court seeking quashing of the proceedings and charges framed against him.             The High Court partly allowed the petition with the finding that since respondent No.2, the wife who had made the complaint in writing to the Women's Commission about respondent No.1 contracting the second marriage, but, not personally herself filed  complaint  under    Section  494   of   IPC,    on  which cognizance could not have been taken by the learned Magistrate in view of provisions contained in Section 198(1) of Cr.P.C. Consequently, the charge framed by the learned Magistrate under Section 494 of Cr.P.C. was quashed, but, the charge under Section 498-A of IPC was maintained and the petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to that extent was dismissed. The same was challenged by the State of Orissa before the Hon'ble Apex Court.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraphs-11 and 12 of its judgment observed as below : " 11. Sub-section (4) creates a legal fiction and provides that although a case may comprise of several offences of which some are cognizable and others are not, it would not be open to the police to investigate the cognizable offences only and omit the non-cognizable offences.      Since the whose case (comprising     of  cognizable    and   non-cognizable offences) is to be treated as cognizable, the police had no option but to investigate the whole of the case and to submit a charge-sheet in respect of all the offences, cognizable or non-cognizable both, provided it is found by the police during investigation that the offences appear, prima facie, to have been committed. 12. Sub-section (4) of Section 155 is a new provision introduced for the first time in the Code in 1973.    This was done to overcome the controversy about investigation of non-cognizable offences by the police without the leave of the Magistrate.           The statutory provision is specific, precise and clear and there is no ambiguity in the language employed in sub-section (4).      It is apparent that if the facts reported to the police disclose both cognizable and non-cognizable offences, the police would be acting within the scope of its authority in investigating both the offences as the legal fiction enacted in sub- section (4) provides that even a non-cognizable case shall, in that situation, be treated as cognizable." With the above observation, the Hon'ble Apex Court allowed the appeal and the impugned judgment and order passed by Orissa High Court in so far as it purports to quash the charge under Section 494 of IPC and the proceedings relating thereto, was set aside. 18. In Ushaben –vs- Kishorbhai Chunilal Talpada and others,    reported in    (2012) 6 SCC 353,        the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to observe that, where complaint contains allegations of commission of offences both under Section 498-A of IPC, as well as Section 494 of IPC, the Court can take cognizance thereof even on the police report. It further observed that no fetters can be put on powers of police preventing them from investigating the complaint alleging offences both under Section 494 and Section 498-A of IPC. From the above judgment, it is clear that when a complaint comprises both cognizable and non-cognizable offences, the investigating agency i.e., the police are required to treat all the offences cognizable and proceed to investigate the case and to submit the charge sheet for all the offences, cognizable or non-cognizable both, provided it is found by the police during investigation that offences alleged prima facie have been committed. 19. In the instant case also, after recording statements of several of the witnesses, including the one mentioned above, the Investigating Officer has rightly come to a conclusion that there are ample materials to file charge sheet against Mamatha R., (original accused No.3) also for the offence punishable under Section 494 of IPC.        Hence, the impugned order of the learned Sessions Judge's on the said point appears to be erroneous. 20. With regard to other offences, including the one punishable under Section 302 and Section 120-B of IPC are concerned, no doubt, none of the charge sheet witnesses appears to have alleged any direct overt act against accused No.3   -  Mamatha    R.,  however,  the  very    case   of  the complainant and his family members is that the property that has come to the share of the deceased K.R.Manjunatha in a family   partition was   made   in favour   of   his  daughter Bhandavya      as  a  guardian.    The   conclusion     of  the Investigating Officer in Column No.17 of the charge sheet is also that the accused in order to take advantage of the property made in favour of Bhandavya, the daughter of the deceased, had not only refused to give custody of said Bhandavya to the deceased, but, also decided to eliminate him so as to retain the property with them. It is attributing with the said mens rea on the part of the accused, the charge sheet has included Section 120-B of IPC also with other A perusal of the charge sheet papers go to show that CW-30 - Smt.Lakshmi, the mother of the deceased, has in her statement before the Investigating Officer accuses the involvement    of  her  daughter-in-law   i.e.,  Mamatha     R., (accused No.3) in the murder of her son K.R.Manjunatha. 21. CW-31 - Nataraja, who is shown to be a friend of deceased K.R.Manjunatha, is shown to have stated before the Investigating Officer that deceased K.R.Manjunatha was telling him about his marital life with Mamatha R., and second marriage of said Mamatha R., with accused No.1 and also he (deceased) demanding the custody of their child Bhandavya to him, however, accused No.3 Mamatha R., refusing to hand over the custody of the child to the deceased. He has stated that he believes that accused No.3 Mamatha R., and accused No.1 might have killed the As observed above, CW-8 Sukanya is shown to have stated before the Investigating Officer that accused No.1 and accused No.3 were residing as her neighbour as husband and wife. Even the elder brother of Mamatha R., (accused No.3) has also spoken about they performing the second marriage of Mamatha R., with accused No.1. 22. In the supplementary charge sheet filed by the police, several of the charge sheet witnesses, including CW-4 Papanna,    CW-5 Thimmegowda and CW-6 Shivanna,              are shown to have stated about the marital dispute between the deceased and accused No.3.      Among them, CW-4 Papanna and CW-5 Thimmegowda are also shown to have conducted a panchayat and advised the parties. 23. The Investigating Officer is said to have collected several   of the   incriminating  materials,   including   motor vehicles used in the commission of the crime, rope of a larger length, a plastic rope, a knife with iron handle, blood stained car-mat, cell phones, DVRs etc.,      According to the learned High Court Government Pleader, several of those articles have got relationship with accused No.3-Mamatha R., and it is only during the course of the trial, the conspiracy between the accused can be established by the prosecution. I do not find any reason to reject the said argument of learned High Court Government Pleader, particularly in the instant case when Mamatha R., (accused No.3) was said to be the wife of deceased K.R.Manjunatha and subsequently married to accused No.1 - Y.D.Manjunatha and accused No.1 and accused No.3 are said to have been refusing to give the custody of daughter of the deceased to him only with an intention to retain the property said to be standing in favour of Bhandavya, daughter of deceased and accused No.3. There are all the reasons to believe that there are materials to subject Mamatha R., (accused No.3) also for trial for all the alleged offences in the charge sheet. 24. In Hem Chand –vs- State of Jharkhand, reported in (2008) 5 SCC 113,     the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para-9 of its judgment was pleased to observe that, it is beyond any doubt or dispute that at the stage of framing of charge, the Court will not weigh the evidence. The stage for appreciating the evidence for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion as to whether the prosecution was able to bring home the charge against the accused or not would arise only after all the evidence is brought on record at the trial. In the instant case also, since it is observed above that there are sufficient materials to proceed with the trial against Mamatha R., (original accused No.3), the Sessions Judge's Court was at error in allowing her application filed under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. and discharging her from the alleged offences.    As such, the said order deserves to be set aside and her application filed under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. deserved to be dismissed. 25. CW-2 K.C.Ramu, the father of the deceased has filed Criminal Petition No.711/2018, seeking a direction for any other investigating authority to investigate the case in Crime    No.400/2015,    which    is  the   subject     matter   in S.C.No.20/2017.     As submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner, the only reason for seeking a fresh investigation is for  the   limited  purpose   of   recording   the    evidence   of Bhandavya, the girl child of the deceased and accused No.3. Even according to the petitioner, the said daughter is aged only about six years. When according to the prosecution, the alleged murder has taken at a place which was away from the home of accused No.3, where the child was residing, the said child cannot be expected to speak about the murder of her father. Regarding the alleged conspiracy, it is not the case of the prosecution that in the presence of said girl Bhandavya, the conspiracy was hatched by the accused.        Further more, the said child was only of about 6 years in her age. For all these reasons, the investigation cannot be found fault with and also for the reason of non-recording the statement of Bhandavya, the girl child of the deceased. As such, I do not find any reason for allowing Criminal Petition No.711/2008. 26. The matter was proceeded with in the Sessions Judge’s Court in S.C.No.20/2017, where six witnesses from PW-1 to PW-6 were examined on behalf of the prosecution. After recording their evidence, the prosecution has filed an application under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. seeking inclusion of discharged accused No.3 in the case and to take cognizance against her. The Sessions Judge’s Court ordered for issuance of summons to accused No.3- Mamatha R., on 22.08.2019. It is challenging the said order, said Mamatha R., has filed 27. Learned counsel for the petitioner for Smt.Mamatha R., in the said petition in his argument made a submission that, in case if this Court allows Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018,     then,  his  Criminal Petition   No.7026/2019 becomes infructuous. Learned   High   Court   Government    Pleader    for  the respondent-State also submitted that if Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018 is allowed, his application filed under Section 319 of Cr.P.C. in the Sessions Judge’s Court becomes infructuous. In view of the fact that the impugned order in Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018 is now found to be perverse and deserves to be set aside, the said Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018 deserves to be allowed. Consequently, the Criminal Petition No.7026/2019 proves to be devoid of merit and deserves to be dismissed. 28. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following order: [i] Criminal Revision Petition No.206/2018 is allowed. The order dated 04.08.2017, passed by the learned V Addl. District & Sessions Judge, Mandya,    in  S.C.No.20/2017,    in    so    far  as discharging respondent No.2        (accused No.3) Smt.Mamatha R., for the offences punishable under Sections 302, 493, 494, 496, 120-B, 201 read with Section 34 of IPC, stands set aside. [ii] The application filed by said accused No.3 Smt.Mamatha R., under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. stands dismissed. [iii] The   Criminal   Petition No.711/2018       and Criminal      Petition    No.7026/2019         stands dismissed. In view of disposal of the main petitions, the pending IA.No.3/2018 in Crl.RP 206/2018 does not survive for Registry to transmit a copy of this order to both the trial Court as also the Sessions Judge’s Court along with their respective records forthwith.
1]                Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. With the consent of both the sides, heard finally at admission stage. 2]                By this Petition, the petitioner is challenging the order dated 04.12.2019 passed by respondent No. 2 thereby rejecting the proposal of petitioner being appointed on compassionate ground as Peon in respondent No. 3 School and the petitioner is also seeking directions against respondent no.2 to grant approval in favour of petitioner as Peon being appointed on compassionate ground from the date of initial appointment i.e. 01.11.2018 and also to make the payment of salary from the date of initial appointment till today and also in future. 3]                The undisputed factors are as under: [a]        The husband of the petitioner – Deepak Desale, was a ‘Peon’, working with respondent no. 3 – [b]        Husband of the petitioner passed away on [c]        The petitioner applied for the post of ‘Peon’ on compassionate ground on 06.10.2018. [d]        Respondent no.3–School by passing a Resolution on 27.10.2018 appointed the petitioner as Peon on 01.11.2018. [e]        The proposal of the petitioner was forwarded to respondent no.2 Education Officer by respondent no.3 – School on 27.11.2018. [f]        On 04.12.2019, respondent no.2 - Education Officer refused to accord approval to the compassionate appointment of the petitioner on the ground that the proposal seeking sanction to the new staffing pattern is pending with the Government and as yet no sanction is received from the Government. 4]                The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the reasons assigned in the impugned order are not sustainable in the light of decision of this Court in Writ The State of Maharashtra and others], Writ Petition No.163/2020 [Sachin Shivajirao Suryawanshi versus The State of Maharashtra and others] and also in Writ Petition State of Maharashtra and others]. 5]                It is the contention of the learned AGP that new staffing pattern has not been sanctioned by the State Government, therefore, approval cannot be granted to the petitioner as Peon. 6]                Upon hearing the learned counsel for the respective parties, we find that issue involved in this petition is no longer res-integra and is covered by the decision / order of this Court in the case of Smt.Yogita Shivsing Nikam [supra]. While considering similar fact situation in para nos. 28, 29 and 30 of the order, this Court “28.        To say the least, we are shocked by the stand taken by the State Government, which is not only against logic and reason, but is in complete contradiction to the law crystallized by this court in numerous judgments. It is unconscionable for the State to canvass such grounds virtually rendering the bereaved family to starvation. We find that the State has consistently ensured that not a single Government Resolution, pertaining to ban on recruitment, stay on filling in vacant posts and prohibition on appointments until the staffing pattern of the non teaching posts is formalized, would apply to appointments made on compassionate grounds. This Court has also consistently taken a view that compassionate appointment would be an exception to the mandatory rule of following specific selection procedure for recruitment on vacant posts or on newly created posts. 29.           We have noticed the agony caused to litigants in such cases. We, therefore, find it appropriate at this stage to record that after the delivery of this judgment, if any case refusing approval to a compassionate appointment which is otherwise legally sustainable satisfying the eligibility criteria, comes to this court, we would be issuing directions recommending strict disciplinary action against the Education Officer and we would not hesitate to initiate contempt of Court proceedings against persons responsible, since they are interpreting the Government        Resolutions       in      the       most inappropriate manner, despite the crystalised position of law. Because of such acts of the Education Officers, widows and eligible candidates are compelled to rush to this Court after having suffered mental and physical agony of a personal loss of a sole bread earner and also spend on litigation which is costly these days. We would also impose heavy costs to be recovered from the salaries of such Education Officers for the pain caused to such petitioners. We find it appropriate to record that if the Education Officer notices that a particular Management is attempting to defeat the rights of an eligible candidate for compassionate appointment, the Education Officer would be at liberty to initiate appropriate action against such Management. 30.           In view of the above, these petitions are allowed. The impugned orders stand quashed and set aside. Approvals stand granted to these petitioners from the dates of their joining duties on compassionate basis, with all monetary benefits accruing to their posts. Formal approval orders shall be issued by the concerned      Education      Officers,          before 7]                In view of the above, there is no necessity to have sanction to the new staffing pattern for appointment on compassionate ground, therefore, the petition deserves to be allowed. Hence we pass the following order : a]                Writ Petition is allowed. The impugned order dated 04.12.2019 is set aside. Respondent no.2 is directed to accord approval to the petitioner’s appointment on compassionate ground from 01.11.2018, as expeditiously as possible. b]                Rule is made absolute in the above terms.
1.      CRL.M.C. 533/2021 has been filed for quashing FIR No.239/2017 dated 12.05.2017, registered at Police Vasant Kunj(North), New Delhi for offences under Sections 509, 506, 323, 341, 354, 354A and 34 IPC. The complainant/respondent No.2 in the said FIR has alleged that on 12.05.2017, when she was going to drop her children to school, the accused who reside in the neighbourhood beat her and outraged her modesty and also committed act of sexual harassment. The contents of FIR are not being repeated here. 2.      CRL.M.C. 534/2021 has been filed for quashing FIR No.238/2017 dated 12.05.2017, registered at Police Vasant Kunj(North), New Delhi for offences under Sections 509, 506, 323, 341, 354, 354A and 34 IPC. 3.      The complainant in the said FIR is the accused in CRL.M.C. 533/2021. The allegation in this FIR is that the petitioners herein have committed offences punishable under Section 354 IPC i.e. assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty. The parties in all the FIRs are residents of 95/9, Kisangarh, Vasant Kunj, Delhi, and are 4.      It is stated that with the intervention of some common friends, relatives and family members, the parties have settled their dispute and an oral settlement has been reached between the parties. It is stated that both the parties, the petitioners and respondents in CRL.M.C. 533/2021 and CRL.M.C. 534/2021, have realised their mistake and they had decided to compromise the matter. 5.      As per the said oral settlement, the parties have agreed that they will approach this Court for the quashing of the abovementioned FIRs. It is stated that they had agreed that they will maintain harmonious relations with each other. It is requested that the FIRs be quashed as the dispute has been amicably resolved. 6.      The parties have also filed their respective affidavits affirming the fact that the matter has been settled amicably.           It is also stated that the complainants in both the petitions do not have any objection if the instant FIRs and the proceedings emanating therefrom are quashed. 7.      Unfortunately, it is now becoming a trend to register FIRs alleging offences under Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D IPC either to force a party from withdrawing a complaint instituted against them or to arm twist a party. Offences under Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D IPC are serious offences. Such allegations have the effect of tarnishing the image of the person against whom such allegations are made. Allegations regarding these offences cannot be made at a drop of a hat. This practice is an abuse of the process of law. The instant case is a classic example as to how frivolous allegations of Section 354 and 354A have been levelled by the parties against each other. A small fight regarding parking has been escalated by levelling allegation of outraging modesty of women. This court can take judicial notice of the fact that the police force is very limited.           Police personnel have to spend time in investigating frivolous cases. They have to attend court proceedings, prepare Status Report etc.          The result is that investigation in serious offences gets compromised and accused escape because of shoddy investigation. Time has come to initiate action against persons who file frivolous complaints under Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D IPC etc. only for ulterior purpose. Some of the petitioners in these instant petitions are students who should understand not to take courts and the police for granted and assume that anything and everything can be settled and they can get away by filing false cases. 8.      In view of the mutual settlement arrived at between the parties, this Court is satisfied that no useful purpose will be served in prosecuting with the present proceedings. Resultantly, the FIR No.238/2017 and FIR No.239/2017 dated 12.05.2017, under Sections 509, 506, 323, 341, 354, 354A and 34 IPC registered at Police Vasant Kunj(North), New Delhi and the proceedings emanating therefrom are hereby quashed. The parties shall remain bound by the mutual settlement and the undertaking given to the 9.      Since the Police has had to spend valuable time in investigating the offence and considerable time has been spent by the Court in the criminal proceedings initiated by the parties, this Court is inclined to impose cost on the petitioners with a warning not to file false and frivolous cases. The petitioners in CRL.M.C. 533/2021 are directed to deposit a sum of Rs.30,000/-(Rupees Thirty Thousand Only) with ‘DHCBA Lawyers Social Security and Welfare Fund’ within three weeks from today and the petitioners in CRL.M.C.534/2021 are directed to deposit a sum of Rs.30,000/-(Rupees Thirty Thousand Only) with ‘DHCBA Lawyers Social Security and Welfare Fund’ within three weeks from today. Details of the Copy of the receipts be also filed with the Registry to show compliance of the order. 8.      The petitions stand disposed of in above terms.
The criminal justice system of ours can itself be a punishment! It is exactly what has happened in this case. 14 years on an issue of abetment of suicide in an episode where a student was reprimanded for misconduct in the College and on endeavor to take disciplinary action and call the father, though the parent did not turn up and subsequently the child committed suicide. An unfortunate situation! However, we are concerned with the issue whether there is any element of an abetment to suicide in the present case which was at the threshold of charges having been framed. On 16.4.2008, the deceased viz. Mr. Gaurav Wahi was attending the last lecture under Mr. Nitin Shyam, one of the accused, and is alleged to have misbehaved with him in the class under the influence of alcohol. When Mr. Shyam asked Mr. Gaurav to leave the class, he ran out of the class. This incident was reported by Mr. Nitin Shyam to Mr. Sarabjit Singh, the acting Head of the Department. The incident was reported in writing by Mr. Nitin Shyam on the next date i.e. 17.4.2008 to the then Head of the Department. An order was passed suspending the deceased from the class and calling upon him to call his parents as an exercise of legitimate disciplinary action. To redeem himself, Mr. Gaurav Wahi, the deceased wrote a letter of apology to the Head of the Department on 21.4.2008 in a way accepting the incident but denying that he was under the influence of alcohol. On 23.4.2008, the Principal, Mr. V. P. Singh issued a notice whereby he directed action against two students including the deceased in separate incidents calling for a security amount of Rs.10,000/- to be deposited with the College as security deposit as a disciplinary exercise and to bring the parents to the office. This deposit was to be refunded at the end of completion of course. Unfortunately the deceased, instead of complying with the disciplinary action, chose to take his own life by jumping in the canal. Before doing so, he sent an SMS to his brother viz. Mr. Himmat Wahi. The purport of the message when translated into English and even read in the original language, was an intimation that he was jumping into the deep side of the river. He stated that amongst all, he loved his mother the most and wanted his father not to be troubled. The obvious purport of this is that while he was closest to his mother, he sought to anticipate that his father may be blamed for the episode and that the father should not be troubled by it. On the complaint of the father, an FIR No.62 of 2008 was registered at P.S. Sardar Rupnagar District, Punjab on 29.4.2008 under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the complaint that the said suicide was instigated by the three accused i.e. the teacher, the Head of the Department and the Principal. It is interesting to note that on the bail application on 06.8.2008, one of the factors which weighed with the High Court while granting bail was that the conduct could not be construed to make the accused liable for offence under Section 306 of IPC as it was to ensure discipline in the class and the campus and even if the teachers are stated to be acting harshly, it could not be said that they wanted to incite, urge or provoke the deceased to commit suicide. On investigation the charge sheet was filed on 13.9.2008 and charges were framed on 16.4.2009. Aggrieved by the said order, three accused preferred criminal revision petition before the High Court which was dismissed on 30.4.2009 with a cryptic order only stating that the proceedings were at an early stage and did not call for any interference. The present appeals were preferred assailing that order and interim stay was granted at the threshold. The trial of course naturally did not proceed in view of the stay by this Court. The matter has rested at that for the last thirteen years! In the present appeal proceedings, the appellants were called upon to file the complete records of the trial Court proceedings vide order dated 26.9.2019 which has been accordingly filed. We have heard learned counsel for parties and examined the record. If we turn to the complaint, the charge sheet is simply an incorporation of what the complainant has said. It is the say of the father, complainant (who was certainly not present to witness what happened) that some students were causing the noise and it was not the son/deceased. The son stated that he was not at fault but he was shouted at by Mr. Nitin Shyam to go out of the classroom. The deceased did so and closed the door. It is alleged that thereafter Mr. Nitin Shyam ran after the son and caught hold of him by the arm and dragged him towards the office of the Head of the Department. On the next day i.e. 17.4.2008, when the deceased went to college, he found the notice to him pasted on their notice board recording that he had been suspended and calling upon his parents, failing which, he will not be permitted to appear in the examination. He was not permitted to enter the classroom on 17.4.2008 and even on making a grievance to the Head of the Department, he did not succeed as he was threatened to spoil his career but on meeting Mr. Nitin Shyam, he was turned away and also stated that if he were to die, it would not bother him. Since nothing happened for the next few days despite the best endeavour of the deceased, he committed suicide. On perusal of the charge sheet, it was found that there is no other independent witness whose statement was recorded or who is cited as a witness to the actual incident. In view of the letter exchanged including his apology letter, it is quite obvious that the complaint has embellishments and endeavour to make out a case of abetment of suicide. If one may say, on even reading of the charge sheet, on the basis of the complaint as it is, there is still no case made out for abetment of suicide. Learned senior counsel for the appellants has relied inter alia on the judgment of this Court in “S. S. Chheena Vs. Vijay Kumar Mahajan and Anr.” reported as (2010) 12 SCC 190 more specifically paragraph 24 & 25. The Court examined the matter in the conspectus of the prevalent legal position in the Country. While suicide by itself is not an offence but an attempt to suicide is an offence under Section 309 of IPC. The Court thereafter turned to the definition of abetment under Section 107 of IPC which reads as “107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing” In the conspectus of the different judgments referred to in that case it was opined that the words “instigation” and “goading” should be intention to provoke, incite or encourage the doing of an act by the latter. While each person’s suicidability pattern is different from others, each person has his own idea of self-esteem and self-respect and therefore it was difficult to lay down any straightjacket formula in dealing with such cases. In this context paragraph 25 reads as under:- “25. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear that in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed suicide.” Learned counsel has also referred to the judgment in “Sanju Alias Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs. State of M.P.” reported as 2002 (5) SCC 371 to contend that the opinion of this Court is that even where a person stated that his death would not make any difference or that he could go and die. That itself would not amount to an instigation in absence of mens rea. One other judgment referred before us is in the case of “State of West Bengal Vs. Indrajit Kundu and Ors.” reported as 2019 (10) SCC 188 in which earlier judgment in “Ramesh Kumar Vs. State of Chhattisgarh” reported as (2001) 9 SCC 618 cited for approval setting out the consideration of the scope of section 306 and ingredients which are essential for abetment as set out in Section 107 IPC. While interpreting the word instigation it was observed in paragraph 20 of Ramesh Kumar Case (Supra) as under: “20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do “an act”. To satisfy the requirement of instigation though it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out. The present one is not a case where the accused had by his acts or omission or by a continued course of conduct created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide in which case an instigation may have been inferred. A word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be instigation. In fact in Indrajit Kundu case (Supra) the judgment referred to us in Sanju case (supra) was once again referred to where the husband and wife’s quarrel resulted in the husband telling the wife “to go and die” and the suicide was committed two days later, was not said to have proximity to the quarrel even if stated in the suicide note. To examine the factual matrix in the present case, in view of the aforesaid legal position, we find not an iota of material on record even assuming the complete charge sheet to be correct which could lead to a conviction in a case of abetment as there was absence of the necessary ingredients to make the offence. While we appreciate the anguish of a father who has lost a young son, that cannot result in blaming the world (in the present case, the institution and its teachers) for what is a basic disciplinary action necessary for running the institute. A contra position would create a lawless and unmanageable situation in an educational institution. The suicide note further shows that there is something to be said about the relationship between the deceased and his father where in fact the deceased thought that his father could be blamed for the episode and thus asked to not to trouble his father. The anguish of the father ought not to have been converted into a case of abetment of suicide and certainly the investigation and the approach of the trial Court could have been more realistic keeping in mind the surrounding facts and circumstances in which the suicide episode occurred. We thus set aside the order framing charges dated 16.4.2009 and impugned order of the High Court sustaining the same and discharge the accused in respect of FIR No.62 The appeals are accordingly allowed leaving parties to bear their own costs.
These appeals, by special leave, challenge the judgment and order dated 28th August, 2009 rendered by the Delhi High Court (hereafter ‘the High Court’, for short) while disposing of 5 (five) writ petitions, viz. WP(C) Nos. 1854 and 1895 to 1898 of 2.     The High Court, for the reasons assigned in the impugned judgment, declared section 9-D of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (hereafter ‘Excise Act’, for short) as intra vires while dismissing the writ petitions. 3.     In course of hearing before us, Mr. S.K. Bagaria, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, did not even attempt to assail the reasons assigned by the High Court for up-holding the constitutional validity of section 9-D of the Excise Act. However, Mr. Bagaria argued that by a judgment and order dated 25th April, 2008, this Court had remitted the matters back to the High Court for consideration thereof afresh. In view of the judicial mandate, while deciding the writ petitions afresh on remand, the High Court could not have limited its decision only to the issue relating to vires of section 9- D. The writ petitions, as amended, also raised the issue as to how the essential pre-requisites of section 9-D were breached by the department in the adjudication orders. The effect of the principles and pre-requisites laid down by the High Court for invocation of section 9-D vis-à-vis the appellants’ case could not have been left undecided. 4.     According to Mr. Bagaria, the principles laid down by the High Court in the impugned judgment ought to have been applied to test the legality and correctness of the impugned action of the department and there being apparent breach of such principles at the end of the department, the High Court committed an error of law in not deciding the other issues raised in the writ petitions. In other words, according to Mr. Bagaria, the High Court could not have stopped at deciding the issue of vires of section 9-D by reading it down and summarizing the conditions precedent in-built into it and it was obligatory for the High Court to decide the writ petitions in its totality; and while so deciding, to declare whether on the parameters of the conditions precedent in section 9-D, as laid down in the impugned judgment, the petitioners were entitled to any relief or not. 5.       Mr. Bagaria continued by submitting that the details of the earlier proceedings as well as all earlier orders including the orders passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (hereafter ‘Tribunal’, for short) and this Court were placed on record before this Court by way of a ‘status chart’. Such status chart was reproduced in the judgment and order dated 25th April, 2008; and after noting all these facts, the matters were remitted to the High Court for deciding the writ petitions afresh. It is not as if the remand was only for deciding the issue of section 9-D alone without deciding the remaining issues raised in the writ petitions. 6.       The argument of Mr. Bagaria was that if the effect of the principles and pre- requisites laid down by the High Court visà-vis the appellants’ case were to be left undecided, the entire proceedings continuing since the last several years would simply be rendered academic. He has, therefore, endeavoured to persuade us hold that the High Court committed an error of law requiring correction by us. 7.       Mr. Bagaria referred to the decisions of this Court in State of UP vs. Mohammad Nooh1, Calcutta Discount Company vs. ITO2, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs. L.K. Ratna3 and Andaman Timber Industries vs. CCE4 in support of his arguments. 8.       To appreciate the contentions of Mr. Bagaria, we need to take a quick look at the events preceding the impugned judgment and order. 9.       The facts giving rise to the writ petitions reveal that huge demands of about Rs. 94,00,00,000/- were raised by the department on the ground that the appellants and its job workers had manufactured deceptively similar versions of certain regular brands of cigarettes showing sale price whereas the same were sold through marketing chain at the higher price of normal brands and that the difference between the two prices was received by the appellants as flow-back through various super wholesale buyers. On 23rd March, 1988 and 29th March, 1988, two show-cause notices were issued by the department to the petitioners raising demands for alleged short payment of excise duty. Such notices primarily relied on the statements of 75 (seventy-five) witnesses to establish the recovery of prices higher than the declared prices and flow back of additional amounts to the appellants. Pursuant to directions of the Bombay High Court, facility of cross-examination was extended in respect of only 29 (twenty-nine) witnesses and most of them, during crossexamination, denied any flow back to the appellants. The remaining statements remained untested but were relied upon by invoking section 9-D of the Excise Act. Grievance of the appellants in the writ petitions was that the parameters of section 9-D had been completely ignored by the authorities. 10.      Since the show-cause notices were spread over a thousand pages and 600 (six hundred) of which were related to 63 (sixty-three) statements on which the department had placed reliance, the appellants on 6th March, 1991 made a request for cross- examination of 31 (thirty-one) witnesses. However, without attempting to follow the principles of natural justice, adjudication orders in respect of the showcause notices had been passed by the adjudicating authority confirming the demands. 11.     Despite persistent requests, the facility of crossexamination was denied. Even before the Collector of Central Excise had passed any order confirming the demand of duty against them, the appellants had rushed to the High Court to complain about the fairness of the procedure followed by the Collector, more particularly, the denial of the opportunity to cross-examine. During the pendency of the proceedings, the Collector had passed the final orders. By applying for amendment in each one of the writ petitions, permission was sought to assail the validity of the orders passed by the Collector. Such applications were disposed of by an order dated 28th October, 1992 with the observation that the order of the Collector being appealable, the petitioners could pursue their remedy in appeal before the prescribed appellate authority. However, since there was also a challenge to the constitutional validity of section 9-D of the Excise Act, the High Court did not dispose of the writ petitions finally but intended to examine that limited question later. The petitioners had preferred appeals before the Tribunal for the period relevant to WP(C) 1854/1992 and 1895/1992. The Tribunal had disposed of the appeals in favour of the department, whereafter appeals were carried to this Court. The appeals arising out of orders passed by the Tribunal relevant to WP(C) Nos. 1896/1992 and 1898/1992 were dismissed by an order dated 12th September, 1997 of this Court for failure to make the requisite pre-deposit. 12.     The Tribunal on 21st March, 2001 had allowed appeals filed by M/s J&K Cigarettes and M/s. Kanpur Cigarettes Pvt. Ltd. These orders were carried in appeal by the department by filing appeals before this Court under section 35L of the Excise Act, being Civil Appeal Nos. 6398-6403 of 2002. 13.     During the pendency of these 2 (two) appeals, the 5 (five) writ petitions came up for hearing before the High Court on December 6, 2006. The common grievance of the petitioners was noted by the High Court in paragraph 3, that they had invoked the writ jurisdiction feeling aggrieved by denial of adequate opportunity to cross- examine certain witnesses whose statements were recorded by the excise authorities in the course of investigation. The appellants had argued that the statements of such witnesses, obtained by the excise authorities in the course of their investigation, could only be used if they were given an opportunity to crossexamine the witnesses. 14.     The High Court in its order dated 6th December, 2006 recorded that 2 (two) issues emerged for decision, viz., “1. Whether this Court would be justified in reading down or interpreting Section 9-D of the Act as suggested by counsel for the petitioner company when three appeals involving the validity of the orders passed by the Collector and the CEGAT placing reliance upon Section 9-D of the Act are pending before the Supreme Court? 2. If answer to question No. 1 is in the affirmative, whether Section 9-D suffers from any vice 15.     Insofar as the first question is concerned, the High Court, inter alia, held as “Two of the orders when challenged before the Supreme Court, were upheld by Their Lordships also while the remaining three appeals are pending adjudication. It is obvious that stand (sic) disposed of or those pending before the Apex Court, the question of fairness of the procedure and in particular, the denial of any opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses was and continues be available to the petitioner. If the discretion vested in the authority in terms of Section 9D(1)(a) has been improperly exercised, Their Lordships could have granted relief in the disposed of appeals and can even now grant relief to the petitioner in the appeals that are pending for disposal. It is also evident that while examining the question of fairness of the procedure adopted by the adjudicating authority, the interpretation of provisions of Section 9D(1)(a) would fall for consideration of Their Lordships. What is the true scope of Section 9 D(1)(a) and what is the true interpretation to be placed upon the same having regard to the possible 'constitutional infirmity suggested by the petitioner's is a matter which would legitimately arise for consideration of the Supreme Court. Even assuming that the dismissal of two appeals filed by the petitioner involving the same question is not indicative of the Court finding infirmity either (sic, in) the procedure adopted by the adjudicating authority or in the interpretation placed upon Section 9D(1)(a) by the saidauthority or the Tribunal, the contrary interpretation which petitioner wishes this Court to place upon Section 9D is a matter still open to the petitioners before the Supreme Court. That being so, there is no compelling reason why this court should take upon itself the exercise of interpreting Section 9 D and in the process reading the same down as suggested by the petitioner. If the interpretation suggested does eventually appeal to the Supreme Court during the course the hearing pending before Their Lordships, the opinion of this court on that aspect would be wholly inconsequential and academic. Such an academic exercise need not be undertaken by this court nor is any duplication of the process of interpretation (sic) Question number 1 is, therefore, answered in the negative.” In the light of the answer to question no. 1, the Court felt that the answer to the second question becomes unnecessary. Consequently, the writ petitions were dismissed with 16. The judgment and order dated 6th December, 2006 was carried in appeal before this Court in Civil Appeal Nos.3187-3189/2008. By an order dated 25th April, 2008, this Court disposed of the appeals by the following order:- “7.      The High Court, as noticed hereinbefore, did not decide the question of constitutionality of the said provision, nor did it determine the objection of the respondents that no cause of action had arisen therefor. 8.       We are, therefore, of the opinion that interest of justice would be subserved if the impugned judgments are set aside and the matters are remitted back to the High Court for consideration thereof afresh. We direct accordingly. 9.       The appeals are disposed of with the aforementioned observations and directions. 10.      However, as these matters are pending for a long time, we would request the High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of thewrit petitions, filed by the appellants, as expeditiously as possible, preferably without a period of three months from the date of communication of this order. All contentions of the parties shall remain open.” 17. It was in terms of the order dated 25th April, 2008 that the High Court once again considered the challenge of the appellants to the vires of section 9-D of the Excise Act. Upon hearing learned counsel appearing for the parties, the High Court in the impugned judgment and order dated 28th August, 2009 recorded the following “32. Thus, we summarize our conclusions as under:- (i)      We are of the opinion that the provisions of Section 9- D(2) of the Act are not unconstitutional or ultra vires; (ii)   While invoking Section 9-D of the Act, the concernedauthority is to form an opinion on the basis of material on record that a particular ground, as stipulated in the said Section, (iii)  Such an opinion has to be supported with reasons; (iv)   Before arriving at this opinion, the authority would give opportunity to the affected party to make submissions on the available material on the basis of which the authority intends to arrive at the said opinion; and (v)    it is always open to the affected party to challenge the invocation of provisions of Section 9-D of the Act in a particular case by filing statutory appeal, which provides for judicial and dismissed the writ petitions holding that the same had no merit. 18. Bearing in mind these preceding facts and circumstances, we need to consider the contentions raised by Mr. Bagaria. For the reasons that follow, the contentions do not commend acceptance. 19. This Court while remitting the writ petitions to the High Court for hearing the same afresh had taken note of the fact that, inter alia, the appellants’ appeals bearing Civil Appeal Nos. 5134-34/1997 questioning the order of the Tribunal confirming the demands against the appellants stood dismissed by an order of this Court dated 12th 20. As noted above, the orders of the Tribunal dated 21st March, 2001 deciding the appeals in favour of the appellants, were the subject matter of challenge in this Court at the instance of the department in Civil Appeal Nos.63986403/2002 . Such appeals were ultimately allowed by order dated 31st July, 2008; while directing a remand, it was observed by this Court that the Tribunal had not recorded any findings regarding the flow back. 21. At this juncture, from paragraph 1(xxiv) of the Statement of Case filed on 10th December, 2012, we also note that pursuant to the remand ordered by this Court as above, the Tribunal disposed of the statutory appeals confirming the demands against Kanpur Cigarettes Pvt. Ltd. and J&K Cigarettes. Civil Appeal Nos. 1533-1534 of 2011, carried before this Court from the orders of the Tribunal, were thereafter dismissed in view of inability to comply with the conditional order passed by this Court directing issue of notice subject to deposit of the entire demand amount as confirmed. 22. There was one other appeal filed before this Court but the same too had not been not pursued by the appellants and the job workers. 23. Therefore, as on date of hearing of these civil appeals, there is no lis pending in respect of the concerned demands between the parties. 24. It would be appropriate to note the issues involved in the writ petitions. First, the vires of section 9-D of the Excise Act was under challenge. Secondly, even if section 9-D were intra vires, whether the parameters thereof were completely ignored by the excise authorities. 25. The writ petitions were instituted before the High Court way back in 1992 before any adjudication order was passed praying, inter-alia, for cross-examination of the remaining witnesses whose cross-examination had already been permitted but who were not produced. Pursuant to the liberty given by the High Court, the appellants filed an application for amendment mentioning in detail as to how and for what reasons invocation of section 9-D by the Commissioner was illegal and also challenging the vires of section 9-D of the Excise Act. 26. Though vehemently argued by Mr. Bagaria, there is no pending proceeding where the principles and prerequisites laid down by the High Court for invocation of section 9-D of the Excise Act vis-à-vis the appellants’ case could be attracted for a decision. When this Court by its order dated 25th April, 2008 remitted the matter to the High Court for deciding the question of vires of section 9-D, only the civil appeals carried from the orders of the Tribunal by the department were pending. These appeals were ultimately allowed by this Court vide its order dated 31st July, 2008 and the matters remitted to the Tribunal. These two appeals, on remand to the Tribunal, have since been decided in favour of the department and against the appellants. As noticed above, the appeals carried to this Court by the appellants from the orders of the Tribunal confirming the demands against the appellants also stand dismissed. We are, therefore, left to wonder in which proceedings would the principles and prerequisites and/or the parameters of the conditions precedent in section 9-D, laid down by the High Court, could at all be applied. 27. The contentions raised by Mr. Bagaria that the parameters of section 9-D were completely ignored while the adjudication orders were made could have been regarded to be of some worth and engaged our attention if only any remedy by way of an appeal before the departmental authority or by a petition before any court were open to be pursued by the appellants as on date these civil appeals came up for consideration before us. What we find from the factual narrative is that although two proceedings were pending before the Tribunal in view of the order of remand dated 31st July, 2008 when the judgment and order dated 28th August, 2009 under challenge came to be made, even those proceedings stand closed today after the appellants had approached this Court and their civil appeals stood dismissed for non-deposit of the amount demanded. With the final decision on all the appeals arising from the orders of the Tribunal being rendered against the appellants, there is no pending lis where the principles and conditions precedent could be applied. The endeavour of the appellants to have these appeals argued before us is, therefore, of purely academic interest and would not serve any real purpose. 28. While dismissing the civil appeals, we endorse the views of the High Court insofar as it spurned the challenge of the appellants to the constitutional validity of section 9-D of the Excise Act. 29. For unnecessarily protracting the proceedings before this Court, although no lis survived for resolution, we impose costs of Rs.5,00,000/- on the appellants. This amount is to be paid to any charitable organization involved in providing help, assistance and relief to children suffering from cancer. Such costs shall be paid within a month from date. Within two weeks thereof, proof of payment shall be produced before the Registrar who shall satisfy himself that the recipient organization is, in fact, providing care to children suffering from cancer. In default thereof, the amount of costs shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue.
1.   The present appeal is directed against an order passed in an intra- court appeal by the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi on 28.5.2012 whereby the judgment and decree passed by the learned Single Bench of the High Court was set aside and the suit filed by the appellant-plaintiff was dismissed. The learned Single Bench decreed the suit of the appellant for a sum of Rs.96,41,765.31 along with simple interest @ 15% p.a. from the date of institution of the suit i.e., 5.10.1987, till the date of payment, on the principal amount of Rs.71,82,266/-. 2.   The appellant filed a suit for recovery of Rs.96,41,765.31 on the ground that appellant is a manufacturer of various varieties of Kraft, writing and printing papers which are sold to customers through wholesalers.     The appellant sells its products through direct payment or payment against hundies payable on due date with the bank by such wholesalers. Respondent-defendant No. 1 was a wholesale dealer of the appellant company in the territory of Delhi since 1984 and was purchasing paper from the Delhi Sales Office of the appellant as well as from its mills situated at Saharanpur.    The tentative stock lifted by respondent no. 1 was worth Rs.15-20 lakhs per month.      The respondents were making regular payments and were enjoying immense confidence of the appellant.    The appellant further explained the terms of the payment in the plaint filed.   The terms of the sale of paper to respondent No. 1 were stated to be through limited credit of 45-60 days as well as through hundi documents. Fifteen days interest- free credit facility from the date of delivery was available and thereafter interest was charged.   Any default of payment carried interest @ 21 % p.a. from the date of delivery till the date of payment and further penal interest @ 3 %. 3. The Respondent No. 1 lifted huge stocks in the month of November 1985 to January, 1986 but did not make the due payments. Even some of the hundi documents were dishonored.        The appellant supplied goods worth Rs.72,27,079/- by 189 consignments against the term of direct payment.     The goods were duly received by respondent no.1 with the signatures of respondent no. 2, its director, but they defaulted in making the payments. The respondents made a payment of Rs.2,99,480/- for 9 consignments by hundi documents but the hundi documents were also returned by the bank unpaid. It was pointed out that since respondent No. 1 was a wholesaler, they were getting trade discount of Rs.700-750 per ton. Thus, the appellant claimed the following amount: Interest on outstanding Bills Rs.24,59,499.31 4. In the written statement, it was alleged that the appellant company was owned and controlled by the family of Bajoria headed by S.S. Bajoria prior to May 1986. The said family was closely connected to the respondents. The appellant installed a paper manufacturing mill at Saharanpur in 1935-36 and offered dealership to the respondents for Delhi and Bombay markets.            The dealership of Bombay was given up in or about 1955-56. The management of the appellant changed in May, 1986.              It was asserted by the respondents that the appellant has not rendered true and proper receipts and a sum of Rs.45 lakhs are due from the appellant. It was also alleged that the bills raised by the appellant are based on fictitious transactions which are tainted with fraud, deceit and circumvention of law.        Such transactions are therefore against public policy and void ab initio. The respondents further alleged that in 1972-73, the Managing Director of the appellant approached Shri Nagarmal Jaipuria and suggested that the respondents should receive certain bills drawn on them inasmuch as the appellant intended to sell certain quality of paper in open market at prices higher than the Mill price. The goods could not be taken out from the Mill unless accepted by one of the wholesalers or dealers. At the threat of termination of the wholesaler agreement, the respondents agreed for such proposal. The respondents averred as “10. Near about the same time, the plaintiff, in addition to the selling of papers in cash in open market, also indulged in tax evasion the sales tax on direct sale from Saharanpur was 4%. The sales tax if the goods were transported to Delhi Depot of the plaintiff and sold from the said depot was Nil. Thus, there was a net tax saving of the value of the goods sold in the open market at Delhi. There is no sales tax leviable on the sale of paper from the Dealer to Dealer at Delhi. If the sales were made directly from Saharanpur the Sales Tax leviable was 4%. The dealer to dealer transaction of sale did not attract payment of anysales tax whatsoever at Delhi. The Plaintiff in addition to making profit by sale of paper in the open market at the price higher than the Mill price also wanted to pocket the sales tax which would have ordinarily been payable had the sales been made from their Mills at Saharnapur. This whole ingenious scheme and device was tainted with fraud and the Jaipuria under undue influence and coercion were made to submit to the illegal transactions which were indulged in by the Bajorias/Plaintiff.” 5. One of the issues framed after completion of pleadings was whether the alleged bills forming the claim in the suits have been raised on the basis of the fictitious and fraudulent transactions. The suit has been dismissed by the Division Bench on such issue inter-alia on the ground that documents had not been proved by summoning the person, who had issued such large number of documents (Ex-P1 – Ex-P976). 6. The appellant filed an affidavit of Shri A.S. Bhargava, Retainer, formerly General Manager-Management Services on 8.12.2003. In such   affidavit, the  appellant   has  produced    976  documents including copies of all the invoices, debit notes, delivery challan, ST-1 Form, interest debit notes, letter of the respondents, credit notes and the statement of accounts. All the invoices are stamped and signed by the respondents. The appellant also produced ST-1 Form in respect of each of the invoices stamped and signed by respondents. In the cross-examination, the witness stated that in case of sale transaction by the company/manufacturer with any wholesaler, the sales tax can be avoided against ST-1 Form. However, if the manufacturer would sell these goods directly to any retailer or consumer, sales tax would be payable.        He further deposed that he has not placed on record the copies of the books of accounts and that the Bills-cum-Challans have not been acknowledged by the respondents in their presence.         He stated that the respondents used to lift the material from their godown. He further deposed that sales tax number is given on the top of the invoices though he could not say if the sales tax number is not of Delhi but of Calcutta. He further stated that the transactions in the suit were from Delhi and no transaction took place from Saharanpur. The suggestion that the suit transactions are fictitious was denied. 7. The respondents produced an affidavit of Shri R.C. Jaipuria in evidence.    It was stated that the books of accounts were not produced for the reason that the office of the respondents was reconstructed during the period 1993-1995 when there were torrential rains and the records kept on the open roof got spoiled and eaten by pests. Though, it is averred that income tax, sales tax returns of these years have been finalized on the basis of destroyed books of accounts.     The respondents have denied the receipt of goods and produced documents Ex. DW-1/1 to Ex. DW- 1/5. He accepted his signatures on the invoices, ST-1 Form and the debit notes but denied signatures on the delivery challans as not of any of the employee of the respondents. It was stated that signatures got signed from him on large number of documents under pressure and duress in the circumstances stated in his affidavit.   He admitted that books of accounts pertaining to transactions in question have not been filed. He denied that the respondents had not paid a sum of Rs.2,72,08,398.29 to the plaintiff between the period 1.5.1985 to 19.3.1987. In respect of signatures on ST-1 Form, he deposed that he used to sign such forms under duress and bear his signatures. 8. On the basis of the evidence led, the learned Single Bench decreed the suit. However, the first appeal was accepted inter alia on the ground that the appellant has failed to prove that it was registered as a dealer with the Sales Tax Authorities in Delhi and it failed to prove having any godown in Delhi. Since the appellant has failed to prove that it was a registered dealer, it could not effect any sale of paper at Delhi without paying Central Sales Tax. The Division “31. We may summarize. The respondent No.1 has failed to prove that it was registered as a dealer with the Sales Tax Authorities in Delhi. It failed to prove having any godown at Delhi. As per the laws applicable to Sales Tax, unless respondent No.1 proved being a dealer registered at Delhi, it could not effect any sale of paper at Delhi without paying Central Sales Tax. It is obvious that respondent No.1 surreptitiously removed its goods from its mill at Saharanpur not under the cover of the invoices raised in favour of the appellant, for the reason these invoices show an intra-city sale and not an inter-city sale. The respondent No.1 has not led any evidence with respect to goods receipts pertaining to movement of goods from its mill at Saharanpur to Delhi and much less shown delivery by any transporter to the appellant. The aforesaid has been totally ignored by the learned Single Judge and therefrom it is apparent that the sales were fictitious i.e. appellant was shown as a name- lender. Respondent No.1 managed to cheat the revenue.” 9.  Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the finding of the High Court is patently erroneous as the respondents have not denied that the appellant is a dealer in the State of Delhi which is evident from Para 10 of the written statement reproduced above. It was further pointed out that the respondents have not disputed the registration of the appellant in the written statement nor any issue was framed about the appellant being a registered dealer in Delhi. Therefore, the High Court had made out a new case for the respondents when such case was not even referred to in the written statement filed. 10. The appellant had filed a registration certificate as the reseller dealer in Delhi as Annexure P/12 along with an application to produce such certificate. The said certificate shows that the appellant was registered as a Dealer under Section 14 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975.       The nature of business being Reselling of Paper and Boards only.        There is a mention of godown in the registration certificate as well. 11.     Learned counsel for the respondents supported the judgment of the learned Division Bench and relied upon judgment of this Court reported as Subhra Mukherjee and Another v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. and Others1 to contend that the onus of proof whether transactions were genuine and bonafide has to be discharged by the appellant. Learned counsel for the respondents also relied upon the judgment of this Court reported as Ishwar Dass Jain v. Sohan Lal2 to contend that the appellant has not produced account books but only extracts which are not admissible in evidence and hence suit was rightly dismissed by the High Court in appeal. 12.    We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find that the Division Bench of the High Court has gravely erred in law in accepting the appeal of the respondents on wholly erroneous and untenable grounds.        Each of the invoices produced bears the registration No. S.T. No. 36/102499/08/84 and also bears the stamp and     signatures   of  the  Managing   Director/  Director  of the respondents.     Apart from such invoice, the appellant has proved the debit note which has also been stamped and signed by the Managing Director/ Director. The ST-1 Form also bears the stamp and signature of the Director of the respondents. Such ST-1 Form bears the invoice number and the date as well as the value of the goods. The witness of the respondent has admitted his signatures on the ST-1 Form, invoice and debit notes.          The respondent company has only denied the signatures of its representative only on the Delivery Challan. 13. The judgments referred to by the learned counsel for the respondents    are   not  applicable  in  the   present  case.   The respondents have alleged that the alleged bills have been raised on the basis of fictitious and fraudulent transactions. Since such stand was of the respondents, the onus of proof of such issue was on the respondents. Such issue necessarily implies that the raising of the invoices is not in dispute but it was alleged that such bills are fictitious and fraudulent. The onus of proof of issue no. 4, whether the defendant no.1 accepted the bills without actual delivery of goods to it is also upon the respondents as it is their stand that the bills were accepted without actual delivery of goods. 14. The reasoning of the Division Bench that the witness examined by the appellant was not in Delhi when the transactions took place is wholly irrelevant to determine whether the invoices, debit notes and ST-1 Form are proved or not. It is not a case of mere exhibition of documents. Such documents were proved by a witness as such documents were kept by the appellant in their ordinary course of business. All these documents are stamped and counter-signed by the representatives of the respondents. Such documents have come from the records of the appellant. It is not necessary for the witness to be signatory of such documents or such documents were executed in his presence. The documents were maintained in the regular course of business of the appellant. In fact there is no dispute about the maintenance and production of such documents. The witness of the respondent has admitted the execution of all the invoices, debit notes and ST-1 Form which bear their stamp and also the signatures of the authorized representative. Therefore, the reasoning given by the High Court is bereft of any merit. 15. The judgments referred to by the learned counsel for the respondents are not applicable to the facts of the present case at all. In Subhra Mukherjee, it was held that a person who attacks a transaction as sham, bogus and fictitious must prove the same. It is the respondent, who have alleged the transaction as fraudulent. In fact, in the aforesaid case, the transaction of sale was found to be bogus and appeal of the alleged purchasers was dismissed. Thus, the onus of proof was on the respondents but the respondents have failed to discharge the same. 16. In Ishwar Dass Jain, it was suit for redemption of usufructuary mortgagee which was dismissed by the High Court. The appellant before this Court was the plaintiff. The defence of the respondent was that there was no relationship of mortgagor and mortgagee between the parties but that the relationship was as landlord and tenant. It was the defendant who has not produced his books of accounts to show that he was paying various amounts as rent to the appellant every month. In these circumstances, the extract of accounts     produced   by   the  respondent    was   found   to  be unbelievable and the suit decreed. In fact, the respondents in the written statement itself denied that they do not have the account books as they got damaged in rain and eaten by pests when they were kept on the roof of a building during the process of reconstruction. Such defence on the face of it appears to be made up defence. The account books were not produced by the respondents to discharge the onus on them. Therefore, the adverse inference had to be drawn against the respondents rather than against the appellant who are not relying upon the entries in the account books alone to maintain suit but reliance is on the invoices, debit note as well as ST-1 Form which had been issued only after the receipt of goods. Though the respondents have denied the receipt of goods but the receipt of goods is proved by numerous documents stamped and signed by the respondents. 17. Section 4(2)(a)(v) of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975 excludes the sale made to the registered dealer from the taxable turnover, which “(2) For the purposes of this Act, “taxable turnover” means that part of a dealer’s turnover during the prescribed period in any year which remains after deducting therefrom,— (i) sale of goods ………………………. (A) of goods of the class or classes specified in the certificate of registration of such dealer, as being intended for use by him as raw materials in the manufacture in Delhi of any goods, other than goods specified in the Third Schedule or (2) for sale by him in the course of inter-State, trade or commerce, being a sale occasioning, or effected by transfer of documents of title to such goods during the movement of (3) for sale by him in the course of export outside India being a sale occasioning the movement of such goods from Delhi, or a sale effected by transfer or documents of title to such goods effected during the movement of such goods from Delhi, to place outside India and after the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India; or” 18. Rule 7 of the Delhi Sales Tax Rules, 1975 allows the dealer to claim deduction from his turnover if he files a declaration in ST-1 Form duly filled in and signed by the purchasing dealer or a person authorized by him in writing. The said Rule reads thus: “7.    Conditions subject to which a dealer may claim deduction from his turnover on account of sales to registered (1) A dealer who wishes to deduct from his turnover the amount in respect of sales on the ground that he is entitled to make such deduction under the provisions of sub-clause (v) of clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 4, shall produce- (a) copies of the relevant cash memos or bills according at the sales are cash sales or sales on credit; and (b) a declaration in Form ST-1 duly filled in and signed by the purchasing dealer or a person authorised by him in writing:” 19. The respondents have admitted that no sales tax is payable by a dealer to a dealer. By necessary implication, the respondents are admitting the appellant to be a dealer as also the respondents to be dealer under the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975. It is only on account of sales made by a dealer to a dealer that the sales tax is not be payable as the incidence of payment of tax would be when the goods are sold to a consumer. The respondents as wholesaler, were getting the benefit of trade discount, which is an agreed term of sale. 20. The High Court, in the impugned judgment erred in holding that the appellant had not examined the author of the documents. Such reasoning is absolutely erroneous as in the written statement, the respondents had not denied their signatures on the documents referred to by the appellant but pleaded duress in executing of these large number of documents. The witness examined by respondent no.1 in his cross examination admitted his signature or that of the representative of company on invoices, debit notes and on ST-1 Form. The respondent had led no evidence in respect of fraud    or  duress  apart    from   self-serving  statement.     The consignment of goods was sent from the month of November 1985 to January 1986. The respondent had signed large number of documents during this period. However, no complaint was made to any person or authority or even to the plaintiff. It is a denial of receipt of goods without any basis raised only in the written statement filed. Such stand is wholly bereft of any truth and is thus rejected. 21. The debit notes stamped and signed by the respondents were in respect of trade discount on the wholesale price mentioned in the invoice. Having accepted the trade discount, which is evident from the stamp and signatures not only on the debit notes but also on the invoice as well as on ST-1 Form, shows that the goods were actually lifted by the respondents for which payment has not been made. The respondents have taken up wholly untenable ground that the documents were signed under duress. Large number of documents such as invoices, debit notes and ST-1 Form spread over 3 months is unbelievable to be an exercise of duress. The stand of the respondents is wholly untenable and unjustifiable in law and is only to defeat the legitimate claim raised by the appellant.     The High Court in the appeal has gravely erred in setting aside the reasoned order of the learned Single Bench on the grounds which were not even raised by the respondents. 22. In view of the said fact, the order of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 28.5.2012 is set aside.             The suit is decreed for recovery of Rs.96,41,765.31 and future interest on the principal sum of Rs.71,82,266/- @9% p.a. from the date of filing of the suit till realisation. The appeal is thus hereby allowed.
The present appeal is directed against an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission [in short, “NCDRC”] in R.P. No. 170 of 2006 on 21.10.2009, whereby the revision against an order   of   the   State   Dispute      Redressal   Commission dismissing the complaint was upheld. The appellant is the brother-in-law of one Kiran Srivastava, who was four months’ pregnant when she was   taken    for   treatment     to   the   clinic   of  the respondent on 22.12.2001.           It is not necessary to examine    the   allegations     on   merits,    however,  the question required to be examined is as to whether the appellant    could    file   a   complaint    in   respect  of deficiency    in   service    on   part   of  the   respondent regarding the treatment given to his sister-in-law The argument of the appellant is that his brother is  a  Constable     and,  therefore,     the   appellant  had availed the services for consideration on behalf of his   sister-in-law,   being   the   Karta   of  Joint  Hindu Family.    Therefore, the complaint on his behalf would be maintainable. A   ‘complainant’ is defined under Section 2(1)(b) of   the  Consumer   Protection     Act,   1986,   whereas  a ‘consumer’ is defined under Section 2(1)(d) of the “(b) "complainant" means - (ii)    any  voluntary      consumer     association registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) or under any other law for the time (iii) the Central Government or any State (iv) one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same interest; (v) in case of death of a consumer, his legal heir or representative; who or which makes a (d) "consumer" means any person who— (ii) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services other than the person who [hires or avails of] the services for consideration paid or promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person [but does not include a person who avails of such services for any commercial purpose]” Learned counsel for the appellant relied upon two judgments of this Court reported as (1998) 4 SCC 39 - Anr., and (2020) 3 SCC 455 - Canara Bank Vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd. and Ors. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and find no merit in the present appeal. A consumer as mentioned above, means any person who   hires     or     avails     of    any     services     for    a consideration      which   has    been    paid    or   promised    or partly   paid     and    partly    promised      and    includes    a beneficiary    of    services.       The    brother-in-law      of  a pregnant   woman     would   not    be   a   beneficiary     of   any services   rendered     by   the   respondent.        There   is   no allegation     that     he    has     paid    or     promised     any consideration      for    engaging      the    services     of    the respondent.      The only assertion in the complaint is that  he   is   the    ‘Karta’    of   a    Joint    Hindu  Family, therefore,    he    is  entitled     to    file   a   complaint    on account of the alleged deficiency of service by the respondent.          Spring Meadows (supra) was a case of medical negligence in respect of a child.                It was the parents   of   the     child,    who    had    filed    a  consumer complaint, which was found to be maintainable in terms of Section 2(1)(d)(ii).        This Court held as under :- “12. In the present case, we are concerned with clause (ii) of Section 2(1)(d).              In the said clause a consumer would mean a person who  hires    or   avails     of   the   services     and includes   any    beneficiary      of   such    services other than the person who hires or avails of the services. When a young child is taken to a hospital by his parents and the child is treated by the doctor, the parents would come within   the    definition      of   consumer     having hired the services and the young child would also become a consumer under the inclusive definition     being     a    beneficiary      of   such services.   The    definition     clause   being    wide enough to    include not       only the    person who hires the services but also the beneficiary of such services which beneficiary is other than the person who hires the services, the conclusion    is    irresistible      that    both    the parents of the child as well as the child would  be    consumer      within    the   meaning     of Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Act and as such can claim compensation under the Act.” Further, Canara Bank (Supra) was a case arising out  of  a  claim    on   account     of   fire   in   the   cold storage, which was used to store the crop of the farmers.    It was, in these circumstances, it was held that the complaint on behalf of the farmers, who were the beneficiaries, was maintainable.                This “29.    The definition of ‘consumer’ under the  Act    is    very    wide    and   it    includes beneficiaries who can take benefit of the insurance availed by the insured. As far as the present case is concerned, under the tripartite    agreement      entered    between   the Bank, the cold store and the farmers, the stock of the farmers was hypothecated as security   with the      Bank and     the Bank    had insisted    that    the   said    stock   should   be insured    with     a   view    to   safeguard    its interest. We may refer to the penultimate clause   of   the    tripartite    agreement   which “WHEREAS the Third Party has agreed to insure the produce/goods stored in the   cold   storage     to   indemnify    the produce in case of any casualty or accident by any means to cover the risk   and    also    to    cover   the   loan amount to avoid loss at the cost of the   Second     Party   till    the   release order    or     repayment     of    the   loan amount.” 30.     The       aforesaid        clause      in unambiguous terms binds the cold store to insure the goods, to indemnify the produce, to cover the risk and cover the loan amount. This insurance policy has to be taken at the cost of the second party which is the farmer. Therefore, there can be no manner of doubt that the farmer    is    a     beneficiary     under   the policy.     The     farmer     is,    therefore, definitely a consumer and we uphold the orders of both the Commissions that the complaint      under       the     Act      is maintainable.” The appellant herein is the ‘Karta’ of a Joint Hindu Family. He cannot be said to be availing the services of a medical practitioner in respect of the pregnancy  of   his  sister-in-law.      The   concept   of Joint Hindu Family does not extend to the treatment of a pregnant sister-in-law.          It is needless to mention that no objection regarding maintainability of  complaint   was  raised   either   before   the  State Commission   or  the  National     Commission,   but   such issue of maintainability of the complaint goes to the root of the case and we have found it to be non- maintainable on the bare assertions of the complaint alone.   We find that the complaint itself was not maintainable and, therefore, the present appeal is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Pending  interlocutory    application(s),    if   any, is/are disposed of. Date : 15-09-2021 This appeal was called on for hearing today. UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following The appeal is dismissed in terms of the signed order. Pending interlocutory application(s), if any, is/are disposed (Signed order is placed on the file)
1         The Special Leave Petition arises from an interlocutory order dated 7 March 2022 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Public Interest Litigation (L) No 9775 of 2020. 2         The petitioners claim to be aggregators within the meaning of Section 2(1A) of the Motor Vehicles Act 19881, as amended by Act 32 of 2019. An aggregator is defined to mean a digital intermediary or market place for a passenger to connect with a driver for the purpose of transportation. Section 93 was amended by the Amending Act so as to encompass the business of aggregators. Sub-section (1) of Section 93, inter alia, stipulates that no person shall engage himself as an aggregator unless he has obtained a licence from such authority and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the State Government. As in the case of other statutes, Section 2(32) defines the expression “prescribed” to mean prescribed by rules made under the Act. The State Government is conferred with a rule making power, inter alia, by Section 96(1) in terms of which it may make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Chapter. 3         The first proviso to Section 93(1) stipulates that, while issuing a licence to an aggregator, the State Government may follow such guidelines as may be issued by the Central Government. Though draft rules were issued by the State Government, no rules have been notified by the State Government as of date. The Central Government has formulated Guidelines in 2020. 4         The provisions noted above have been construed recently in a judgment of this Court in Roppen Transportation Services Pvt Ltd v Union of India2 5         The Division Bench of the High Court, by the impugned order dated 7 March 2022 , observed that in view of the statutory mandate of Section 93(1), no person could be allowed to continue as an aggregator without obtaining a licence. Taking note Special Leave Petition (C) No 3006 of 2023 decided on 7 February 2023 of the fact that the rules were at the draft stage, the High Court has observed that till such time that draft rules are finalized, the Guidelines of 2020 would hold the field and any person willing to operate as an aggregator must follow the regulatory framework brought about by the Guidelines. Taking note of the statutory regime which was brought into force in 2019 by the amendment of Section 93, the Division Bench observed that the second respondent had permitted aggregators, such as the petitioners, to operate in Maharashtra without insisting on compliance with the statutory requisites and though no statutory licences were obtained. While balancing the equities, the Division Bench held that instead of restraining the petitioners herein from operating in the State, it was inclined to grant an opportunity both to the petitioners and to other unlicensed aggregators to apply for licences as required by sub-section (1) of Section 93. The following interim directions were issued in paragraph 10 of the interim order dated 7 March 2022: “10. For such purpose, we direct the Transport Department of the State Government to issue appropriate notification in the Official Gazette forthwith and not later than 9th March, 2022 empowering each and every Regional Transport Authority in the State of Maharashtra to act as the Licencing Authority for grant of license under subsection (1) of section 93 of the Act. Since the 2020 Guidelines also refer to an Appellate Authority in paragraph 18, it would be prudent for us to direct that the provisions of section 89 of the Act, which is also part of Chapter V, may be followed in such a case. The State Transport Appellate Tribunal or similar such authority, by whatever name called, shall be the Appellate Authority. We are informed that the Chairman of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Maharashtra, functions in the State as the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and, therefore, such Tribunal shall also be notified to be the Appellate Authority for the purposes of the 2020 Guidelines. In the notification to be published in terms of this order, the Transport Department shall indicate that all the aggregators operating in the State of Maharashtra may apply for license by 16th March, 2022. If any application is received by any Regional Transport Authority from the prospective licensees, earnest endeavour shall be made to convene urgent meeting of such Transport Authority to consider such application, as early as possible but not later than a fortnight from date of receipt thereof. In the event the concerned aggregator / prospective licensee agrees to comply with the conditions laid down in the 2020 Guidelines, issuance of license in its favour shall not be unnecessarily delayed. In the event any application is rejected, the concerned aggregator shall be at liberty to file an appeal under section 89 of the Act read with paragraph 18 of the 2020 Guidelines before the empowered Appellate Authority.” 6       It was against the interim order which was passed in the PIL that this Court was moved under Article 136 of the Constitution by Uber India Systems Private Limited (the first petitioner) and Uber India Technology Private Limited (the second petitioner). 7       While issuing notice in these proceedings on 21 April 2022, this Court directed that the status quo, as it exists, shall be maintained until further orders. 8       During the course of the hearing, it has emerged both from the submissions of Mr Dhruv Mehta, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, and Mr Siddharth Dharmadhikari, counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Maharashtra, that a provisional licence was issued to the petitioners. The licence was valid for a period of thirty days. 9       The grievance of the petitioners is that certain conditions which have been imposed by the State for the grant of a licence such as: (i) the requirement of maintaining an office in fifty jurisdictional offices of the Road Transport Authority; and (ii) maintaining a simulator, as well as certain other aspects may not be practicable for 10     This is a matter of policy which pertains to the jurisdiction of the State 11     We are of the view that it would not be appropriate to continue with the present proceedings, which arise from an interlocutory order of the High Court. As correctly observed by the Division Bench of the High Court, in view of the statutory regime which has come into force with the amendment of Section 93 by the Amending Act of 2019, no person can continue as an aggregator in the absence of a licence. We accordingly permit the petitioners to apply for a licence within a period of three weeks, that is, on or before 6 March 2023. Within the aforesaid period, it would be open to the petitioners to submit a representation to the State Government in regard to the conditions which were imposed while granting a provisional licence to the petitioners. The State Government shall, within a period of two weeks from the date of the submission of the representation, take a considered view on the grievance which has been set forth in the representation of the petitioners. We clarify that we have not expressed any observations on the merits of such a grievance. Thereafter, the State Government may take an appropriate decision so that pending the finalization of the rules, an appropriate decision is taken in regard to the applications for the grant of licence in terms of the provisions of Section 93(1) of the Act. If the petitioners have any subsisting grievance, it would be open to them to move the High Court of Judicature at Bombay either in the pending Public Interest Litigation or independently so that the merits of their grievance(s) can be considered by the High Court. 12     Since the interim order of this Court has held the field since 21 April 2022, we extend its operation till 20 April 2023 in order to enable the petitioners to apply for a licence and for the State Government to take an appropriate decision. The State Government, which has to act as a regulator, must take an expeditious decision on the formulation of an appropriate policy, which may be embodied in terms of the rules which are framed under the Act. The decision of the State Government should be taken expeditiously so as to avoid litigation and uncertainty. 13     The Special Leave Petitions are accordingly disposed of. 14     Pending applications, including the application for intervention, stand disposed
Two affidavits have been filed before us. The first affidavit is filed by the Registrar General of the High Court of Odisha in respect of the steps taken for providing virtual access which would obviate the need for any Benches. There are 30 district Courts functioning in the State of Odisha and   the  status   report   qua  computerization  to facilitate the functioning in the District Courts and Taluka Courts has been enclosed. The details of equipments which have been purchased have been set out. The e-Filing Version 3.0 stands implemented from 02.04.2022   and   a  total    of   4382   Advocates   have registered on the e-Filing Portal of this Version and  11290  cases   have  been    filed  through   e-Filing Portal in the District Courts.        Virtual court rooms have been established in the various districts and proceedings are being conducted as per Odisha High which would facilitate a witness to appear in any Court including the High Court of Odisha from any district of the State or from any remote area in accordance   with   the  Standard     Operating   Procedure (SOP). Technical persons have been appointed. The High Court of Odisha is functioning on hybrid mode and  links  are   published.      Hands  on   training  for judicial officers, Advocates and Advocates’ clerks are being conducted. That should have taken care of the needs of access to justice. There is, however, something more to it! The conduct of the Advocates as reflected in the supplementary   affidavit    filed    by  the   High  Court leaves us with little doubt that there are many so- called Advocates enrolled at the Bar whose bread and butter is obviously not this profession.          After the order was passed by us on 14.11.2022, the same was circulated to all the Bar Associations through their respective      District        Judges.      Despite      our observations,      agitation       and    picketing      etc. The matter deteriorated to a stage where the District   Judge,    Khurda     at   Bhubaneswar    received reports about violent obstruction to the judicial officers,   staff   and   litigants    by  members    of  the Bhubaneswar    Bar   Association     restraining    them   in entering   court   building    on   25.11.2022.    In   fact, after receiving reliable information, the District Judge had sought for police protection for judicial officers,   staff   and   litigants.     300/400   Advocates obstructed   them   when   staff    and   officers   reached there and police personnel reached at about 11 a.m. But even under police protection, the Bar members prevented access by violently obstructing them.           The District    Judge    also     reported    that    no    prior information was given to him by the Bar Association regarding such picketing on 25.11.2022. It is, however, averred that the District Judge, Koraput,    Jeypore    enclosed     the   extract    of   the resolution District Bar Association, Jeypore dated 24/25.11.2022    indicating    the   decision   to  withdraw their    earlier     resolution       for    strike     dated There is then an additional affidavit of the Registrar stating that several Bar Associations of State of Odisha continue to abstain from work and have indulged in boycott, picketing etc. during the month of October, 2022 and also in November, 2022. The judicial work in least 20 districts continued to be hampered in the month of October, 2022 and 3216 cumulative judicial working hours have been lost. The  District  Judge,   Sambalpur   intimated  that members of the District Bar Association, Sambalpur staged a picketing on demand of establishment of the permanent Bench of Odisha in Western Odisha and even refused to attend a meeting called by the District A  similar  approach   has   been  adopted  by  the Baramba Bar Association as per the District Judge, Cuttack. Position is no different of others. We had already cautioned the Bar Associations on many occasions in the earlier main order as well as on  the  last  date  that   if  they   fail  to  conduct themselves as members of the noble profession, they loose any protection. They have done everything to invite what we are required to now direct to uphold the majesty of law and direct the working of the Courts functional. We  may  also  notice   that   the  Central  Action Committee has filed an affidavit.        We notice from Annexure   R-1   to  it   that    the    President   of  the Sambalpur Bar Association is actually the President of the Central Action Committee. If the leaders of the Bar Associations in Odisha seek to invite harsh action, we will have to oblige The Bar Council of India is represented before us.   We would expect the Bar Council of India to take appropriate action against all the            executive members  of    different   Bar   Associations     on  strike contrary to directions of this Court and logically we would expect their licences to be suspended at least till the work is resumed and further action against the members of the Action Committee. We would expect the police to provide foolproof arrangements for ingress and egress of not only the judicial officers but all willing members of the Bar and the litigants who would be entitled to contest their own proceedings.      Necessary prohibitory orders be  issued    around  the    areas    of   the  courts   and appropriate steps including any preventive arrest or other  arrest    as  required    in   the   wisdom   of  the administration as required to be taken.         We can only emphasize that it is the administration’s duty and obligation   as  also  the    methodology    by  which  they have to ensure [no advice is necessary by us] to see to it that the Courts are made functional and the agitating  lawyers  are   not able  to   obstruct  the working of the Court nor any ingress and egress of the lawyers willing to work or the public who seeks to  practice directly   since these  lawyers  are  not assisting them. The judicial officers will pass necessary orders in each of the proceedings and if adverse orders become necessary, let the same be passed as we have given the option to the litigants to come to court and defend or prosecute their proceedings freely. Further status report be filed by the Registrar. List on 12.12.2022.
The instant appeal has been filed by the Insurance Company (defendant in the claim petition) against the judgment and decree dated 23.10.2021 passed by the Additional District Judge No.4, Bikaner in Civil Original Suit No. 07/2020, whereby while allowing the suit filed by the dependents of the deceased Premaram      @   Premratan     under   the   Fatal   Accident    Act, compensation of Rs.5,94,160/- has been awarded for which employer, Pratibha Industries Limited Nagaur, its Supervisor, Managing Director and Insurance Company were made liable jointly and severely. Deceased Premaram @ Premratan was an employee in Pratibha Industries Ltd. He died on 18.6.2008, during the course of his employment, while he was doing work of removing soil from the pipeline in the ditch. The masala mixture machine fell upon him as a result of which he collapsed. At the time of his death, he was aged 25 years and earning Rs.250/- per day in lieu of labour work. At that time, defendant nos. 1 and 2 were Supervisor and Managing Director of the Pratibha Industries Ltd. The incident was reported to the police, upon which FIR No. 231/2008 under Section 302 and 287 IPC was registered. All the employees working under Pratibha Industries Ltd. were insured under the Wokmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 (now amended as The Employees’s Compensation Act, 1923 w.e.f. 18.1.2010) (herein- afterwards referred to as ‘the Act of 1923’). After trial, the learned trial court decreed the suit. Aggrieved with the same, this first appeal has been filed. Learned counsel for the appellants during arguments on admission submits that the insurance company issued policy in the category of workmen compensation for 30 employees drawing salary less than Rs.4,000/-. Since deceased was employee of Pratibha Industries Ltd., the dependents of deceased had remedy to file claim petition under the Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923.    Insurance Company is liable only under the provisions of the Act of 1923. He also submits that wife of the deceased has re- married, so she is not entitled to get the compensation. He further submits that the Insurance Company was impleaded as party respondent only on 30.11.2010 at a belated stage. Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that the income of the deceased was more than Rs.4,000/- per month, whereas, the insurance was with regard to workers drawing salary less than Rs.4,000/- per month each. At the time of incident, no security measures were provided to the employees by the employer. Therefore, the conditions of the policy have also been violated. Learned counsel for the appellants further submits that the deceased was working for sub-contractor. Considered     the  arguments     raised by the   learned counsel for the appellants and perused the record. It is not in dispute that the deceased was an employee of Pratibha Industries Ltd. It is also not in dispute that Workmen Compensation Policy issued in favour of Pratibha Industries Ltd. by the appellant – Insurance Company was in force at the time of incident. It is not in dispute that the compensation was assessed on the monthly income of Rs. 2600/- of the deceased, which is below Rs.4,000/- per month. Regarding not filing claim under the Act of 1923, it is made clear that though claimants had remedy under the Act of 1923 also, however, there is no bar to file suit for compensation under the provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855. The provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855 applies against all wrong doers including the employer. The scope of the provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855 is wider than the scope of Act of 1923. Civil Courts are competent to entertain any civil dispute unless it is barred by any law. There is no bar under any provisions of law to claim compensation under the Fatal Accident Act by employee against his employer. Hence, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant in this regard is prima facie not tenable. The other grounds raised by the learned counsel for the appellants are also not tenable. Contention with regard to re- marrying of the deceased’s wife is concerned, the same does not disentitle her from claiming compensation for death of her husband. The amount of compensation awarded by the learned trial court looking to the young age of the deceased and number of claimants cannot be said to be unreasonable. There is no merit in this appeal. Accordingly, this first appeal stands dismissed at admission stage.
1.      Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Bombay at Goa in Criminal Writ Petition Nos. 466 of 2021, 467 of 2021, 471 of 2021 and 472 of 2021 dated 03.08.2022, by which, the High Court has dismissed the said writ petitions holding that the period of Parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering the 14 years to actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release, the original writ petitioners have preferred the 2.      That the original petitioners are all convicts undergoing life imprisonment. That all of them were released on parole under the provisions of Goa Prisons Rules, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the “Rules, 2006”). That all the original petitioners applied for premature release under the Rules, 2006. The State Sentence Revenue Board recommended for premature release. The State Government sought opinion of the convicting Court on the premature release of the petitioners. The convicting Court opined that the convicts shall not be released prematurely considering the gravity of offence. Therefore, the State Government rejected the premature release of the petitioners. The convicts – original writ petitioners, therefore, preferred the respective writ petitions before the High Court of Bombay challenging the State’s decision to not considering their case for premature release. Before the High Court, it was the case on behalf of the original writ petitioners that the convicts have completed 14 years in custody and therefore, as such were entitled for premature release. It was the case on behalf of the convicts- original petitioners that the period of parole is not to be excluded from the period of sentence under the Rules, 2006 while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release. Taking into consideration the Rule 335 of the Rules, 2006 which provides that the period of release on Furlough and Parole “shall be counted as remission of sentence ….” the High Court by impugned judgment and order has observed and held that the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release. As the respective convicts – original writ petitioners excluding period of parole did not complete 14 years of actual imprisonment, the High Court by the impugned judgment and order has dismissed the respective writ petitions. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court, the original writ petitioners have preferred the present petitions. 3.     Shri Siddharth Dave, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respective petitioners has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the Hon’ble High Court has seriously erred in holding that the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence under the Rules, 2006 while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release. 3.1.   It is vehemently submitted by Shri Dave learned Senior Counsel for the respective petitioners that the Hon’ble High Court has erred in relying on the Rule 335 of the Rules, 2006 to hold that since period of release on parole is counted as remission, the same cannot be counted as part of sentence. 3.2. It is submitted that even while on parole the accused /convicts can be said to be in custody / judicial custody and therefore, period of parole is to be included while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release. 3.3. It is vehemently submitted that as such the view taken by the High Court is just contrary to the decision of this Court in the case of Sunil Fulchand Shah vs. Union of India reported in (2000) 3 SCC 409 as well as in the case of Avtar Singh vs. State of Haryana reported in (2002) 3 SCC 409 (para 11). 3.4. It is further submitted by Shri Dave learned senior counsel for the original writ petitioners-convicts that even as per Section 55 of the Prisons Act, 1894, a prisoner when being taken to or from any prison in which he may be lawfully confined, shall be deemed to be in prison and therefore, deemed to be in custody and therefore, the period of parole shall have to be included as in custody for the purpose of actual period of imprisonment while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment. Making above submissions, it is prayed to hold that the period of parole is to be included while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release. 4.     The short question which is posed for the consideration of this Court is whether the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence under the Rules, 2006 while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature 5.     While considering the aforesaid question /issue, the object and purpose of parole is required to be taken into consideration. Parole is a conditional release. Parole can be granted in case of short-term imprisonment. Duration of parole extends to one month. Parole is granted by the State Government. For parole, specific reason is required. Parole can be granted for number of times. 6.     “Imprisonment” is defined under Rule 2(21) of the Rules, 2006. “Imprisonment” means imprisonment of either description as defined in Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the General Clauses Act, 1897. The term of imprisonment is not included in the computation of term of parole. 7.     Keeping in mind the above, the issue involved in the present case viz. whether the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release is to be 7.1.   The High Court while passing the impugned judgment and order and taking the view that the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment has heavily relied upon or considered Rule 335 of the Rules, 2006 which provides that the period of release on Furlough and Parole “shall be counted as remission of sentence ….”. Once the period of parole is to be counted as remission of sentence, as rightly observed and held by the High Court, the period of parole is also required to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment. 8.     Now, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of Sunil Fulchand Shah (supra) relied upon by learned senior counsel for the respective petitioners – convicts / prisoners is concerned, the said decision shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. It was a case of detenue under the provisions of the COFEPOSA Act. Even in the said decision, it is observed and held that the period of detention would not stand automatically extended by any period of parole granted to the detenu unless the order of parole or rules or instructions specifically indicates as a term and condition of parole, to the contrary. In the present case the term ‘imprisonment’ is not included in the computation of term of parole. Rule 335 specifically provides that parole is to be counted as remission of sentence. Therefore, the said decision would not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. 8.1.   Similarly, the decision of this case in the case of Avtar Singh (supra) also shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand while considering the issue viz. whether the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence under the Rules, 2006 while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment. 9.     Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners relying upon Section 55 of the Prisons Act, 1894 that even on parole the prisoners shall be deemed to be in custody and therefore, the said period is to be included for the purpose of actual imprisonment is concerned, the aforesaid has no substance. Section 55 of the Prisons Act, 1894 shall not be applicable with respect to release on parole. Section 55 of the Prisons Act, 1894 shall be applicable in a case where a prisoner is taken out from any prison, he shall deem to have been in prison. However, the same shall not be applicable with respect to release on parole. 10.    If the submission on behalf of the prisoners that the period of parole is to be included while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment is accepted, in that case, any prisoner who may be influential may get the parole for number of times as there is no restrictions and it can be granted number of times and if the submission on behalf of the prisoners is accepted, it may defeat the very object and purpose of actual imprisonment. We are of the firm view that for the purpose of considering actual imprisonment, the period of parole is to be excluded. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court holding so. 11.    In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, all these Special Leave Petitions deserve to be dismissed and are accordingly dismissed.
1.     The Order dated 16.05.2017 passed by the Allahabad High Court is under challenge before this Court. By the aforesaid order, Criminal Revision Petition was filed by the respondent No.2 challenging the order dated 15.03.2017 whereby the application filed under Section 319 Cr.P.C. for summoning the present appellant, was dismissed. 2.     The High Court, vide impugned order had quashed the Order dated 15.03.2017 and remanded the matter back to the Trial Court for fresh examination. 3.     Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant established his business of manufacture of tools in the year 2003. A complaint was filed by respondent no.2 regarding murder of his brother Bachchu Prasad. It was mentioned therein that he used to work in the appellant’s firm. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint, FIR No. 480/2013 was registered against unknown persons. Nearly two months after the complaint, wife of the deceased gave a complaint to the Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad making false allegations against the appellant. The appellant was given notices by the Investigating Officer. Entire information sought was furnished by him. During investigation, the police found an eye witness namely Rajesh Kumar to the alleged murder whose statement was recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The aforesaid fact was concealed by the complainant while making complaint against the appellant. After completion of investigation, the police filed chargesheet against two accused persons namely Pannelal @ Panna Lal and Ombeer Singh. The appellant was listed as a prosecution witness. During trial, statements of various witnesses were recorded. Even the appellant was examined as PW-6. None of the witnesses stated anything against the appellant. After the statement of the appellant (PW-6) was recorded, the complainant filed an application under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. to summon the appellant as accused solely on the basis of certain vague oral allegation by PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3. After hearing arguments, the Trial Court dismissed the aforesaid application vide order dated 15.03.2017. It is the aforesaid order, which is under challenge in the present appeal before this Court. 4.      The argument raised by learned counsel for the appellant is that the approach of the High Court in sending matter back for examination afresh was not right as the material which was available in the form of statements of various witnesses could very well be appreciated to find out as to whether any case was made out against the appellant for summoning under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. It is not mere suspicion on the basis of which an additional accused could be summoned. Only where strong and cogent evidence is available against a person from the evidence produced before the Court, which could lead to his conviction, that such a power could be exercised. It could not be exercised in a casual and cavalier manner. 5.      In the absence thereof, the impugned order passed by the High Court deserves to be set aside and the order passed by the Trial Court, dismissing the application should be upheld. In support of his arguments, reliance was placed on judgments of this Court in Hardeep Singh and Ors. Vs. State of Punjab & Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 92; Mohd. Shafi vs. Mohd. Rafiq , (2007) 14 SCC 544; Sagar vs. State of U.P. and Anr., (2022) 6 SCC 389; Kailash vs. State of Rajasthan and Anr., (2008) 14 SCC 51. 6.      He further submitted that the stage at which the application was filed by the complainant to summon the appellant as an additional accused, the trial was going to conclude as the entire evidence had been led. Vide judgment of the Trial Court dated 06.10.2017, even the accused against whom the chargesheet was filed, were also acquitted. It was on the basis of the sketchy evidence produced by the prosecution before the trial court that the appellant was sought to be summoned. 7.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the State and the complainant submitted that a clear case was made out against the appellant for summoning him as an additional accused. The trial court had failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it. No doubt, the High Court could have corrected it but the matter was remanded back. The material already on record could have been taken into account. Had it been so, the appellant would have also faced trial along with other accused or even could be tried separately. However, the fact that the accused persons against whom the chargesheet was filed were acquitted vide judgment dated 06.10.2017, has not been disputed. 8.      Heard learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the paper book. 9.      The principles of law with reference to exercise of jurisdiction under 319 Cr.P.C. are well settled. 10.     The Constitution Bench in Hardeep Singh and Ors.’s case (supra), opined as “105. Power u/s 319 CrPC is a discretionary and an extraordinary power. It is to be exercised sparingly and only in those cases where the circumstances of the case so warrant. It is not to be exercised because the magistrate or the sessions judge is of the opinion that some other person may also be guilty of committing that offence. Only where strong and cogent evidence occurs against a person from the evidence laid before the court that such power should be exercised and not in a casual and cavalier manner. 106 . Thus we hold that though only a prima facie case is to be established from the evidence laid before the court, not necessarily tested on the anvil of cross-examination, it requires much strong evidence that near probability of his complicity. The test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to conviction. In the absence of such satisfaction, the court should refrain from exercising power “9. The Constitution Bench has given a caution that power under Section 319 of the Code is a discretionary and extraordinary power which should be exercised sparingly and only in those cases where the circumstances of the case so warrant and the crucial test as notice above has to be applied is one which is more that prima facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to conviction….” 12.      If the evidence already on record produced by the prosecution is considered on the touchstone of law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Hardeep Singh & Ors. case (supra), it does not go beyond suspicion. There is no eye-witness to the occurrence. All what has been stated by PW-2 (brother of the deceased) is that the deceased who was working with the appellant as Manager though claimed to be a partner by the complainant, that there was some dispute regarding money between the appellant and the deceased. Rajesh Sharma whose statement was got recorded by police under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. also retracted therefrom while appearing in court as PW-5. He stated that it was recorded by the police under threat of involvement in some false case. He also did not raise any finger towards the appellant. Rather he was the first person to visit the house of the deceased after the murder and informed the appellant to reach there. He was working as part time cook with the family of the deceased. Without any material brought on record, the widow of the deceased merely stated that she is sure that the appellant had committed murder of her husband as there was no other enemy. One of the brothers of the deceased who appeared as PW-1, who was not present at the spot, did not utter a single word against the appellant. 13.      The aforesaid material was not sufficient if examined in the light of the law laid down by this Court for summoning of an additional accused in exercise of power under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. to establish complicity of the appellant in the crime. 14.      After conclusion of the entire evidence and examination of the material produced on record even against the charged accused, the trial court had acquitted them vide judgment dated 15.03.2017. It shows that material produced on record was not even sufficient for conviction of the accused against whom chargesheet was filed. 15.      One of the arguments raised by learned counsel appearing for the parties was that in the case in hand, the High Court instead of appreciating the material placed on record by the parties in the form of evidence to find out as to whether a case was made out for summoning of the appellant as an additional accused, remitted the matter back to the trial court for consideration afresh. Remand in such a matter will only result in prolonging the litigation. The High Court only recorded that reasons assigned by the trial court for rejecting the application were not sufficient. To avoid delay, it would have been proper exercise of power in case the High Court would have considered the material and opine as to whether a case was made out for summoning of additional accused. Whatever reasons have been recorded by the trial court in the order so passed, may not have been happily worded to the satisfaction of the High Court, but that error could have been corrected in exercise of revisional power. 16.      For the reasons mentioned above, the present appeal is allowed. The impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside and the application filed by the complainant for summoning the appellant as an additional accused is dismissed.
Present :    Mr. Munfaid Khan, Advocate for the petitioners. The limited challenge to the order dated 23.09.2021 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Palwal (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Tribunal’) is to the extent whereby the Tribunal has directed 50% of the compensation awarded to be deposited in fixed deposits. The further challenge is to the order dated 12.05.2022 dismissing the application filed by the petitioners for release of the amount directed to be deposited in the Learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that the petitioners lost their son namely, Sakir, in a motor vehicle accident. The Tribunal awarded a total amount of Rs.11,18,272/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till its realization.  However, it was further directed that on realization of the awarded amount together with the interest, the same shall be shared equally by the claimants and 50% of the amount of the share of the claimants was directed to be paid in cash to them whereas remaining 50% was directed to be deposited in a FDR in a nationalized bank in their names for a period of three years. authenticity of this order/judgment CR No.2270 of 2022                                                    -2- Learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that both the petitioners are over 40 years of age and have three other children to look after and hence the money is urgently required by them. In support of his contention, he relies on judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in H.S. Ahammed Hussain vs. Irfan Ahammed, [2002(3) RCR (Civil) 563] to contend that in the case of an adult it would not be appropriate to direct the deposit of the amount of compensation in a fixed deposit. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners. In the present case, the claimant-petitioners are the parents of the deceased who are wanting the release of the amount which has been awarded to them but 50% of the awarded amount has been directed to be deposited in FDRs. It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners require the amount for taking care of their three other minor children and in support of his contention learned counsel for the petitioners has relied upon a judgment by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in H.S. Ahammed Hussain’s case (supra) wherein it has been held as under : “8. Learned counsel for the appellant lastly submitted that the amount of compensation payable to mothers of the victims should not have been directed to be kept in fixed deposit in a nationalised bank. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are of the view that the amount of compensation awarded in favour of the mothers should not be kept in fixed deposit in a nationalised bank. In case the amounts have not been authenticity of this order/judgment CR No.2270 of 2022                                                     -3- already invested, the same shall be paid to the mothers, but if, however, invested by depositing the same in fixed deposit in a nationalised bank, there may be its premature withdrawal in case the parties so intend.” Keeping in view the law laid down in the above referred case as well as the fact that the petitioners are over 40 years of age and have also three other minor children to look after, the present petition is allowed. The order dated 12.05.2022 passed by the Tribunal is set aside and the award dated 23.09.2021 is modified to the said extent. The amount of compensation lying deposited in the shape of FDRs be released to the petitioners forthwith. Disposed off in the above terms. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed off.

Ms Gauri Godse, i/b. Mr. Rohit Joshi for the Respondent. 1.           Learned counsel for the Petitioner-husband states that the Petitioner-father has had no access to the children since June-2020. He states that the father of the Petitioner is having health issues and he would like to see his grandchildren. It is stated that the previous order dated 10/03/2022 whereby this Court had allowed access on the birthday of the children was not complied with. 2.           Needless to state that the Petitioner-father, the non-custodial parent cannot be deprived of his right to spend quality time and enjoy the company of the children. Furthermore, the children also have right to love and affection of both parents as well as grandparents.             This is essential for personal development and overall well being of the children. 3.          Hence, without going into the merits of the matter the Petitioner-father is permitted to have access to the children from 14 th April, 2022 to 16th April 2022. The Respondent -mother shall bring the children to Phoenix Mall, Viman Nagar, Pune, on 14/04/2022 at 11.00 a.m. The parents and children shall spend time together till 3.00 p.m. The Petitioner shall take custody of the children on 14/04/2022 at 3.00 p.m.    The Petitioner shall bring the children to Phoenix mall on 17/04/2022 at 11.00 a.m. and spend time together till 3.00 p.m. and hand over custody of the children to the Respondent -mother on 17/04/2022 by 3.00 p.m. 4.          Considering the nature of the dispute, the matter is referred for mediation and with consent Smt. Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi, former Judge of this Court is appointed as a Mediator with a request to mediate and assist the parties in arriving at an amicable settlement and to submit the report preferrably within six months. 5.          Matter be listed on 21/04/2022 to decide the issue of interim access arrangement.
This Criminal Petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “Cr.P.C.”) is filed seeking quash of charge sheet in C.C.No.973 of 2020 on the file of the Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State. The petitioner is A-4 in the above C.C.No.973 of 2020 on the file of the learned VI Additional Junior Civil Judge, Guntur. He has been facing prosecution for the offences punishable under Section 498A r/w 34 IPC and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that it is stated in the F.I.R that the petitioner, who is A-4, only harassed the de facto complainant by using harsh language against her. He would submit that, however, it is stated in her Section 161 Cr.P.C statement that the petitioner herein, who is A-4, also harassed her along with along with other accused by making illegal demand for additional dowry. Therefore, he would submit that this is a deliberate improvement made in her Section 161 Cr.P.C statement, which was not stated in the F.I.R. So, he would submit that this is a false case foisted against him and thereby prayed for quash of the said charge sheet against the petitioner. The aforesaid ground urged by the petitioner is not a valid legal ground for quash of the charge sheet. No doubt, it is only stated in the F.I.R that the petitioner harassed the de facto complainant by using harsh language against her and that subsequently she stated in her Section 161 Cr.P.C statement that the petitioner also harassed the de facto complainant along with other accused by demanding additional dowry from her. Whether the subsequent statement given by her in her Section 161 Cr.P.C statement is an improvement made subsequently or not and whether the said evidence is true or not is the matter relating to appreciation of evidence by the trial Court in the final adjudication of the case. This Court in a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C cannot appreciate the evidence on record in exercise of its inherent powers. Since the ground that was urged by the petitioner pertains to appreciation of evidence of the witnesses, it cannot be a valid legal ground for quash of the charge sheet. Therefore, the Criminal Petition is devoid of merit. Resultantly, the Criminal Petition is dismissed. Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending, in the Criminal Petition, shall stand closed.
The petitioner had approached the Regional Passport Officer, Madurai for renewal of his passport by submitting an application dated 19.04.2022. The passport authority sought verification report from the police. The police reported that a criminal case is pending against one Nazirudheen and that the petitioner's passport was seized in that connection. In view of the said report, the passport authority did not process the petitioner's application. That led to the filing of this writ petition. 2.When the matter was taken up for hearing, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the second respondent submitted that the petitioner had not come under their adverse notice.            Thiru.Nazirudheen who was referred to in the police verification report of course figured as an accused in Crime No.1 of 2019 registered on the file of the Q Branch CID Police, Madurai. He happened to be the petitioner's travel agent.         Except this relationship, there was nothing adverse to the petitioner. The second respondent made it clear that they have no objection for allowing the writ petition. 3.I could have simply noted the stand of the second respondent and allowed the writ petition as prayed for. But my conscience did not permit me to leave things at that.       My Lord the Hon'ble Chief Justice had allotted the General Miscellaneous portfolio which includes the subject of passports. Crime No.1 of 2019 was registered by Q Branch CID Police, Madurai based on credible information that one Vaithiyanathan in conspiracy with unknown public servants and others at Madurai and Trichy fraudulently obtained Indian passports for many Sri lankan and Indian nationals by using forged documents. The criminal acts in question had taken place during the period from 01.02.2019 to 30.06.2019.          The case was registered for the offences under Sections 120B, 420, 465, 468, 471 of IPC           and Sections 12(1A)(a), 12(1A)(b) and 12(2) of the Passport Act, 1967. I was also informed that a public interest litigation in WP(MD)No.2563 of 2021 was filed seeking transfer of investigation to CBI. The Hon'ble Division Bench was however pleased to direct the Q Branch to complete the investigation within three months. This time limit was later extended by a period of six months. I felt surprised that this direction of the Hon'ble Division Bench was not complied with. Final report was yet to be filed on the ground that sanction had not been obtained for prosecuting the erring government servants. 4.Judges do not live in vacuum. They are not isolated from the ground reality. I read in newspapers that Shri.K.Annamalai, the State BJP President had raised this very same issue in a big way. Almost three years had elapsed since the first information report was registered. I could not turn a Nelson's eye. After granting relief to the petitioner by way of an interim direction, I called upon the second respondent to file a status report. I wanted to know as to why sanction was not being accorded. Pursuant to the said direction, the second respondent has filed a detailed status report. It is seen therefrom that as many as 41 persons are proposed to be prosecuted. This includes the officials from the Regional Passport Office, Madurai and State police officials. The Central Government had granted sanction in respect of one of its servants and declined for 13. The Government of Tamil Nadu has granted sanction for prosecuting Thiru.Sivakumar, the then Assistant Commissioner of Police, Intelligence Section, Madurai City. Apart from him, one Inspector and three Head Constables are also proposed to be prosecuted. The final report is to be filed shortly before Judicial Magistrate No.IV, Madurai. The learned Magistrate is directed to scrutinize the same and point out the defects, if any. Once the defects are pointed out, the investigation officer shall rectify forthwith. The learned Trial Magistrate shall take a call regarding cognizance expeditiously. Already several months have elapsed. The case has serious national security implications.    It is scandalous that one police station in Madurai City has facilitated fraudulent issuance of as many as 54 passports.        The corrupt elements must be brought to book at the earliest. 5.The process of police verification in connection with passport applications is well known. The application is sent to the jurisdictional police station of the District/City Police where the residence of applicant is located through the portal for field verification. There are four logins for the police at •     One for the field enquiry police officer. •     One for the DSP/ACP (authorised by SP/COP) who acts as the nodal officer for passport verification. At the Police Station, login is given to the field enquiry police officer, invariably a Head Constable of each police station who is nominated by the SHO for passport field verification. Login is provided for the SHO who accepts the verification of the field enquiry police officer and submits the status of verification to the district / city office. This is done through mPassport Application. The field enquiry police officer logs in to the app from the Tablet with his login details. In the home page, the list of Police Verification Requests will be populated and each request is selected for the verification process. The field enquiry Police officer is now required to answer few questions on Identity Check and Criminal Background. The questions that are to be answered by the field enquiry police officer pertain to the following : is there any doubt regarding the citizenship of the applicant; is any criminal case pending; is any court order against his movement pending and others. For the query on citizenship, the police invariably depend on the documents furnished by the applicant and they are documents like birth certificates, 10th certificate, AADHAAR card, previous passport etc.                Regarding criminal antecedents, verification is based on CCTNS check. In the fields for the remarks – Nil adverse or Case particulars are mentioned depending on the enquiry results. PVR status is selected as Clear or Adverse as the case may be. The field enquiry police officer uploads his signature and also uploads the documents that are bought by the applicant during field verification.          This completes the field verification on the mPassport Police APP by the Field enquiry police officer. The next role is that of the SHO who logs in on the passport seva web page through his log in ID and approves the verification done by the field enquiry Police officer. This involves his signature being uploaded             and filling up of the remarks if any. The signature is a picture of the sign made on a paper and is uploaded through the portal directly. At the District/City level – 2 logins are provided. One login is a general one to view the overall status of passports verification requests received, verifications completed, pending list The next login is the one that can be opened only in the designated system earmarked for passport verification for the district/city to access the portal for final approval. This can be accessed only by using a particular dongle that is provided by the passport authority to the district SP/COP, City. The district SP or city COP nominates one DSP/ACP level officer who on behalf of the district forwards all the verified applications with any remarks to the passport office. The verified passports get accumulated at the district login end which is opened by the nodal DSP/ACP level officer (nominated by the SP/COP) authorised to do the super check and final approval. The DSP, invariably the DCRB DSP in Districts and AC IS in cities is entrusted with the dongle that is required to be inserted in the designated computer while giving a final approval. However, during the final approval the DSPs enter remarks alone and they can’t over write the fields already filled by the police station. A Rural district typically handles somewhere between 150 to 200 passports per day and is forwarded after verification to the passport office by the Nodal DSP. The Role played by the field enquiry police officer is the most crucial. The DSPs/ACPs role is important for creation of new / alteration of IDs of SHO and Field Police officers as he is the one vested with the power. This role is delegated to the nodal DSP / ACP by the SP/COP and he is the custodian of the passport dongle and the designated passport verification system. SPs and COPs generally review the total number of passports verifications requests received, verifications completed and verifications pending during the periodic monthly crime review meetings. 6.One can note that that the buck stops with the nodal officer. The involvement of the officials above the said rank may not really arise. During the relevant time, Shri.S.Davidson Devasirvatham, IPS was the Commissioner of Police, Madurai City.     Had the final report been filed before the public interest litigation was instituted in the year 2021 ; had the time limit laid down by the Hon'ble Division Bench been adhered to ; had the sanctioning authorities accorded sanction without delay, the present controversy would not have arisen at all. I give a clean chit to Shri.S.Davidson Devasirvatham IPS. At the same time, I compliment Shri.K.Annamalai, the State Bharatiya Janata Party President for having taken up the cause. He has played the role of a watch dog in a democracy. But for him the matter would not have come to light.
These cross appeals are directed against the order passed by Ld. CIT(A)-5, Bengaluru and they relate to the assessment year 2.     These appeals were earlier disposed of by this bench of Tribunal vide its order dated 2.12.2016. The assessee challenged the order passed by the Tribunal by filing appeal before Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka. The Hon’ble High Court has restored the matter back to the file of the Tribunal with the following “8.     From close scrutiny of the order passed by the Tribunal, it is evident that the tribunal while deciding the appeal preferred by the revenue has adjudicated only grounds 2 and 3 and has not adjudicated the ground with regard to the claim of assessee under Section 54F of the Act in the light of law laid down by Delhi High Court in ‘CIT Vs. GITA DUGGA’, (2013) 257 CTR (DEL.) 208. The Tribunal has failed to adjudicate the grounds raised by the assessee in her appeal. The impugned order therefore, cannot be sustained in the eye of law. It is accordingly quashed. The matter is remitted to the tribunal to decide the appeal preferred by the assessee as well as the revenue afresh in accordance with law laid down by this Court in NAVIN JOLLY, GITA DUGGAL, M. WAHAL supra. It is therefore, not necessary for us to answer the substantial questions of law.” We notice that the Hon’ble High Court has directed the Tribunal to decide the appeals afresh. 3.     At the time of hearing, both the parties admitted that the tax effect involved in the appeal filed by the revenue is below the monetary limit as prescribed by the CBDT in its circular No.17/2019 dated 8.8.2019. Accordingly, the appeal of the revenue is dismissed in limine. 4.     The only issue urged in the appeal of the assessee relates to partial rejection of deduction claimed u/s 54F of the Income-tax Act,1961 ['the Act' for short]. 5.     The facts relating to the issue are stated in brief.           The assessee is an individual and she filed her return of income for the year under consideration on 29.9.2008 declaring a total income of Rs.9,06,860/-. The assessee had earned long term capital gain of Rs.1,56,85,225/- on sale of a land and claimed exemption u/s 54F of the Act from it to the extent of Rs.1,56,33,870/-. Accordingly, the assessee offered net long term capital gain of Rs.51,355/-. 6.     The A.O. examined the long-term capital gain declared by the assessee.    It was noticed that the assessee along with 3 other persons had sold a property on 27.10.2007 for a consideration of Rs.5.35 crores.     The assessee’s share out of the above said consideration was Rs.1,60,50,000/-. The assessee claimed that she has purchased a residential house property in a project named “M/s. Prestige Ozone” for a sum of Rs.1,72,29,993/-. Accordingly, she claimed deduction u/s 54F of the Act to the extent of 7.     The A.O. examined the details of purchase of the property at Prestige Ozone.   The A.O. noticed that the initial agreement was entered by the assessee’s husband Shri Y.C. Rami Reddy with M/s Prestige Properties on 5.5.2004 for construction of         building at a cost of Rs.46,35,610/-. Subsequently, a sale deed was registered on 24.2.2007 for purchase of plot No.8 having extent of Rs.6,108 sq.ft. for a consideration of Rs.39,67,933/-, on which the above said construction has happened. The said sale deed was executed in favour of Shri Y.C. Rami Reddy and the assessee herein. The assessee claimed that she has reimbursed all the payments made by her husband to him and she also incurred further expenses for interior design, etc.  Accordingly, the assessee claimed that the entire cost of purchase was met by her and further, the property was purchased by her from her husband. The breakup details of total expenses incurred in connection with this property was stated Cost of land as per agreement dt 5.5.04                          Rs.39,69,933.00 Cost of Construction as per agreement dt. 5.5.2004               Rs.46,35,210.00 Common Maintenance Charges as per clause 8(b)                       Rs.87,500.00 Common Maintenance Charges as per cluse 8(d)                        Rs.87,500.00 Payment made to Prestige and other structural changes            Rs.34,17,560.00 Payment made to Morph Design vide letter dt 6.3.2007             Rs.30,66,252.00 for changes in the villa Material purchased and supplied by the assessee                   Rs.7,89,677.00 Cost of registration of land on 24.02.2007                        Rs.3.77,540.00 Other costs                                                       Rs.8,98,421.00 8.      The A.O. examined the cost of purchase of property furnished to him and noticed that the assessee could not furnish evidence with regard to the expenses incurred on interiors, etc. Accordingly, the A.O. held that the cost of acquisition should be taken as Rs.91,57,683/- only as given below:- 1. Cost of land vide sale deed dt 24.2.2007             – Rs.39,69,933.00 2. Cost of construction vide agreement dt.5.5.2004      – Rs.46,35,210.00 3. Common maintenance charges vide clause 8(b)&(d) - Rs. 1,75,000.00 4. Cost of registration of land on 24.2.2007             - Rs. 3,77,540.00 Total cost of acquisition                            - Rs.91,57,683.00 9.      The A.O. also examined the claim of the assessee for deduction u/s 54F of the Act.             The A.O. took the view that the assessee is not eligible for deduction u/s 54F of the Act for the following reasons:- 1. The assessee has already held 50% share in the Prestige Ozone building and hence, there was no necessity for her to pay the full consideration of Rs.1.72 crores to her husband. 2. The husband has relinquished his right in favour of the assessee on 3.1.2008 by way of an unregistered document, which       was     subsequently        registered     on     25.1.2010. Accordingly, the assessee cannot be considered to have purchased new house within one year before the date of transfer. 3. The assessee has got more than one residential house at the time of sale of the land as given below:- a) Property at 19/1, Outer Ring Road, Penathur Junction, b) A residential house in Ooty. 4. The assessee has also advanced money to purchase another flat at M/s. Prestige Knotting Hill on 8.6.2007. Purchase of another new house within 3 years is in violation of third proviso to Section 54F of the Act, which would disentitle the assessee for deduction u/s 54F of the Act. 5. The assessee became absolute owner of the building in Prestige Ozone only on 25.1.2010. Accordingly, the A.O. rejected the claim for deduction u/s 54F of 10.    Before Ld. CIT(A), the assessee filed detailed submissions. The assessee also submitted that the sale consideration should be reduced by an amount of Rs.26,75,000/-. It was submitted that the above said amount represented sale value of a portion of land gifted by assessee’s son to her. However, in the assessment of the assessee’s son, the above said amount of Rs.26.75 lakhs was included for computing capital gain disregarding the claim of gift to the assessee herein. Accordingly, it was prayed that the above said amount should be reduced from the value of sale consideration offered by the assessee, since it has already been assessed in the hands of the assessee.        Since the assessee has made detailed explanations with regard to the various observations made by the A.O, the Ld. CIT(A) called for a remand report from the A.O. 11.     The assessee submitted she does not own the property mentioned in her return of income as located at Outer Ring Road. It was submitted that the rental income shown against that property was actually received from the property purchased in Prestige Ozone and the mistake has happened due to typographical mistake. We notice this fact was accepted by the tax authorities. 12.    (a) With regard to the residential flat located in Ooty, the A.O. observed in the remand report that it consisted of 3 residential buildings and hence, the condition prescribed in section 54F of the Act is violated. (b) The AO reiterated that the assessee has given advance for purchase of a flat at Prestige Nottingghill, which is a violation of the one of the conditions prescribed in sec. 54F of the Act. Hence the assessee is not eligible for deduction. (c) The AO accepted the fact that the sale consideration of Rs.26.75 lakhs was assessed in the hands of the assessee’s son. 13.        In the reply to the remand report, the assessee submitted that the assessing officer is taking the view that there are three residential house properties in Ooty for the first time.             It was submitted that it is a single building having three units in ground floor, 1st and 2nd Floor. The assessee also submitted that she has furnished bills for interior works to the maximum extent possible and she could not furnish evidences to the extent of Rs.16,97,098/- , which agreed for disallowance. 14.     The Ld. CIT(A) after considering the remand report as well as the reply given by the assessee to the remand report gave his decision as under:- a) The residential flat located at Ooty is a single residential building consisted of 3 residential units. Accordingly, he held that the residential building at Ooty should be considered as a single house property. b) With regard to advance given by assessee for purchase of flat at Prestige Knotting Hill, the Ld. CIT(A) held that mere giving advance will not result in acquisition of any house property. Hence, it cannot be said that the third proviso to section 54F of the Act is violated. 15.    With regard to the cost of acquisition of the building, the Ld. CIT(A) took the view that (a)  the   expenditure    incurred     on   interiors,  renovation, furnishing, etc. after registration of plot i.e. after 24.2.2007 cannot be taken as part of cost of acquisition. (b) the assessee has purchased only 50% of right from her husband on 27.10.2007 and she has already held 50% earlier. The Release deed given by husband of the assessee was registered on 25.1.2010, which is 3 years from the date of sale of original property.      Accordingly, the Ld. CIT(A) took the view that, irrespective of the amount of payment made to her husband, the assessee can be said to have acquired only 50% of the property on 25.1.2010, which falls within 3 years from the date of sale of original property. Accordingly, he took the view that the deduction u/s 54F of the Act shall be available to the assessee only to 50% of cost of acquisition of asset. (c)   Since the Ld CIT(A) took the view that the expenses incurred    after  24.2.2007    cannot    be    considered    as   part   of acquisition of property, he computed the cost of acquisition as Cost of construction              -      Rs.46,35,610/- Cost of land as per sale deed -          Rs.43,47,473/- Maintenance charges               -      Rs. 1,75,000/- Accordingly, the Ld CIT(A) held that the assessee is eligible for deduction u/s 54F of the Act only in respect of 50% of the cost of property, i.e., 50% of Rs.91,58,083/-, i.e., Rs.45,79,042/-. 16.     Aggrieved by the order passed by Ld CIT(A), both the parties have filed appeals before the Tribunal. We have already dismissed the appeal of the Tribunal, since the tax effect involved therein was less than the monetary limits prescribed by CBDT for pursuing its appeals. Hence the issues urged by the assessee are only need to be adjudicated. Following issues are contested by the assessee:- (a)  Whether    the  Ld  CIT(A)     was    justified  in   ignoring expenditure of Rs.81,71,910/- incurred on the new house property for computing deduction u/s 54F of the Act. (b)   Whether Ld CIT(A) was justified in holding that the assessee is entitled to claim deduction to the extent of 50% of the cost of acquisition computed by him. 17.        From the facts discussed above, we noticed that the agreement for the purchase of property was first entered by the assessee’s husband in 2004.         However the sale agreement for transfer of plot was registered only on 24.2.2007 and it was registered in the name of the assessee and her husband. Accordingly, the AO/Ld CIT(A) has taken the view that the assessee was already entitled to 50% of the right in the property.             The Hon’ble Karnataka High Court has held in the case of Mrs. Jennifer Bhide (2011)(15 taxmann.com 82)(Kar) that the deduction u/s 54 of the Act should not be denied merely because the name of assessee’s husband is mentioned in the purchase document, when the entire purchase consideration has flown from the assessee. In the instant case also, the plot was purchased in the name of the assessee and her husband.       Hence, what is required to be examined is the question,      viz.,   who     has      funded       the     acquisition?. Admittedly, in the instant case, the assessee’s husband had advanced money initially. Subsequently, the admitted fact is that the assessee has reimbursed the money to her husband and finally, it is the assessee who has actually given funds for the acquisition of the property. We notice that the Ld CIT(A) has taken the view that the funds given by the assessee should not be taken in account and in our view, the said view of the Ld CIT(A) is not, in our view, correct in law. 18.    The deduction u/s 54F of the Act only induces an assessee to make investment in residential house property. If the assessee has herein has given money for acquisition of the property either directly to the builder or as reimbursement to her husband, then the assessee should be given benefit of deduction u/s 54F of the Act for the cost of acquisition. 19.     The next impediment in the minds of the tax authorities was that the plot was purchased jointly in the name of the assessee and her husband and hence it should be held that both held 50% right each and hence the assessee could have purchased only her husband’s share only.       We are unable to agree with this logic. There is no dispute that the assessee has actually given funds for the acquisition of the property. When the assessee’s husband has not given money for purchase of property, how it can be held that her husband was owner of 50% of the property merely for the reason that his name appears in the conveyance agreement and also in the rental agreement. The deduction under sec.54F of the Act shall be given only to the person who has invested the money. In the instant case, it is the assessee who has invested the money and hence the assessee should be given deduction u/s 54F of the Act for the money invested by her. 20.     The next issue is with regard to the cost of acquisition. The assessee claimed the cost of acquisition to be Rs.1,72,29,993/-. During the remand proceedings, the assessee herself has agreed for reduction of cost of acquisition by Rs.16,97,098/-, since she could not prove the incurring of expenses to that extent. Hence the cost of acquisition as per the assessee now stands at Rs.1,55,32,895/-. There is no dispute that the assessee has invested the money to the above said extent in acquisition of the property. 21.    The Ld CIT(A) has taken the view that the amount spent after the date of registration of land, i.e., 24.02.2007 for interiors, renovation, furnishing etc cannot be part of acquisition.             The Hon’ble Karnataka High Court has held in the case of Mrs. Rahana Siraj (2015)(58 taxmann.com 333)(Kar) that the money spent in additions, alterations, modifications and improvements on the new asset to make it habitable would be eligible for benefit of deduction u/s 54F of the Act. Accordingly, we set aside the view so taken by Ld CIT(A) as it is contradictory to the binding decision of jurisdictional High Court. Accordingly, we hold that the assessee is eligible for deduction u/s 54F of the Act in the amount spent on interiors, renovation, furnishing etc. 22.       In view of the foregoing discussions, we hold that the deduction u/s 54F of the Act should be computed on the above said amount of Rs.1,55,32,895/- and direct the AO accordingly. 23.    In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is treated as allowed and the appeal of the revenue is dismissed. Order pronounced in the open court on 28th Apr, 2022.
For Petitioner(s)         :    Mr. S.S. Ladrecha with 1.     In the wake of instant surge in COVID – 19 cases and spread of its highly infectious Omicron variant, abundant caution is being maintained, while hearing the matters in the Court, for the safety of all concerned. 2.     The present case, originally, was filed as criminal misc. third bail application. However, upon an application being moved on behalf of the petitioner seeking to treat the bail application as criminal revision petition, the same was allowed by this Hon’ble Court    order   dated    14.03.2022.            Accordingly,    the   said   bail application was treated and registered as criminal revision petition, which is listed before this Court for consideration. 3.     The prayer made in the present case, as originally filed, “It is, therefore, most respectfully and humbly prayed that this bail application under Section 167 (2) Crpc. may kindly be allowed and the petitioners may kindly be ordered to be release on bail in FIR no. 273/2021 registered on 16.10.2021 Police Station Osiyan at district 4.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that an F.I.R., bearing No. 273/2021 was lodged on 16.10.2021 under Section 363 I.P.C., by one Chhoturam S/o Ramnarayan stating that his brother’s    daughter,     Sumitra        was       abducted     by   the   present accused–petitioner       alongwith        other       persons;    whereafter,   the petitioner was taken into custody on 19.10.2021, and remained as such for one day, until ordered to be released by the competent court on 20.10.2021; however, subsequently the petitioner was again arrested and took into custody. As per learned counsel, the total period of the petitioner’s custody was beyond the mandated time period, as prescribed under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. Relevant portion of Section 167 Cr.P.C reads as follows: - 167.     Procedure      when             investigation       cannot    be (2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded under this section may, whether he has or has not jurisdiction to try the case, from time to time, authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the whole; and if he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, and considers further detention unnecessary, he may order the accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having such jurisdiction: [(a) the Magistrate may authorise the detention of the accused person, otherwise than in custody of the police, beyond the period of fifteen days, if he is satisfied that adequate grounds exist for doing so, but no Magistrate shall authorize the detention of the accused person in custody under this paragraph relates to an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a (ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to any other offence, and, on the expiry of the said period of ninety days, or sixty days, as the case may be, the accused person shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail, and every person released on bail under this sub- section shall be deemed to be so released under the provisions of Chapter XXXIII for the purposes [(b) no Magistrate shall authorise detention of the accused in custody of the police under this section unless the accused is produced before him in person for the first time and subsequently every time till the accused remains in the custody of the police, but the Magistrate may extend further detention in judicial custody on production of the accused either in person or through the medium of (c) no Magistrate of the second class, not specially empowered in this behalf by the High Court, shall authorise detention in the custody of the police. [Explanation I.—For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that, notwithstanding the expiry of the period specified in paragraph (a), the accused shall be detained in custody so long as he does not furnish bail.] [Explanation II.—If any question arises whether an accused person was produced before the Magistrate as required under clause (b), the production of the accused person may be proved by his signature on the order authorising detention or by the order certified by the Magistrate as to production of the accused person through the medium of electronic video [Provided further that in case of a woman under eighteen years of age, the detention shall be authorised to be in the custody of a remand home or recognised social institution.] 5.     Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the petitioner is entitled to statutory / default bail, and that his right to seek the same has accrued on the ground that the period, as laid down in Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., of 90 days, was exceeded and he was kept in custody for a total period of 92 days. 5.1    Learned counsel also submits that the petitioner was arrested on 19.10.2021 at 11:00 a.m. and was in custody until 20.10.2021      i.e. one     whole       day,      and      from 27.10.2021     to 24.01.2022, and also, he was in custody for 5 days in October, 30 days in November, 31 days in December and 24 days in January, until the challan i.e. the chargesheet was filed on 24.01.2022. 6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the Ors., Criminal Appeal Nos.185-186 of 2022, decided on 07.02.2022, wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court observed as under:- “8. The only point that arises for our consideration in this case is whether an Accused is entitled for statutory bail Under Section 167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure on the ground that cognizance has not been taken before the expiry of 60 days or 90 days, as the case may be, from the date of remand.. . . . 9. . . . . The scheme of the provisions relating to remand of an accused first during the stage of investigation and thereafter, after cognizance is taken, indicates that the legislature intended investigation of certain crimes to be completed within the period prescribed therein, according to this Court in Bhikam chand Jain (supra). This Court held that in the event of investigation not being completed by the investigating authorities within the prescribed period, the Accused acquires an indefeasible right to be granted bail, if he offers to furnish bail. This Court was of the firm opinion that if on either the 61st day or the 91st day, an Accused makes an application for being released on bail in default of charge- sheet having been filed, the court has no option but to release the Accused on bail. However, once the charge-sheet was filed within the stipulated period, the right of the Accused to statutory bail came to an end and the Accused would be entitled to pray for regular bail on merits.. . . .It was held by this Court that the filing of charge-sheet is sufficient compliance with the provisions of proviso (a) to Section 167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure and that taking of cognizance is not material to Section 167. The scheme of Code of Criminal Procedure is such that once the investigation stage is completed, the court proceeds to the next stage, which is the taking of cognizance and trial. During the period of investigation, the Accused is under the custody of the Magistrate before whom he or she is first produced, with such Magistrate being vested with power to remand the Accused to police custody and/or judicial custody, up to a maximum period as prescribed Under Section 167(2). Acknowledging the fact that an Accused has to remain in custody of some court, this Court concluded that on filing of the charge-sheet within the stipulated period, the Accused continues to remain in the custody of the Magistrate till such time as cognizance is taken by the court trying the offence, when the said court assumes custody of the Accused for purposes of remand during the trial in terms of Section 309, Code of Criminal Procedure. This Court clarified that the two stages are different, with one following the other so as to maintain continuity of the custody of the Accused with a court. 10.    It is clear from the judgment of this Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra) that filing of a charge-sheet is sufficient compliance with the provisions of Section 167, Code of Criminal Procedure and that an accused cannot demand release on default bail Under Section 167(2) on the ground that cognizance has not been taken before the expiry of 60 days. 11.. . . . In Sanjay Dutt (supra), this Court held that the indefeasible right accruing to the accused is enforceable only prior to the filing of challan and it does not survive or remain enforceable, on the challan being filed. It was made clear that once the challan has been filed, the question of grant of bail has to be considered and decided only with reference to the merits of the case under the provisions relating to grant of bail to an accused after the filing of the challan.. . . . 12.    In Madar Sheikh (supra) … this Court held that the right conferred on an accused Under Section 167(2) cannot be exercised after the charge-sheet has been submitted and cognizance has been taken. . . . 15. A close scrutiny of the judgments in Sanjay Dutt (supra), Madar Sheikh (supra) and M. Ravindran (supra) would show that there is nothing contrary to what has been decided in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). In all the above judgments which are relied upon by either side, this Court had categorically laid down that the indefeasible right of an Accused to seek statutory bail Under Section 167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure arises only if the charge-sheet has not been filed before the expiry of the statutory period. Reference to cognizance in Madar Sheikh (supra) is in view of the fact situation where the application was filed after the charge- sheet was submitted and cognizance had been taken by the trial court. Such reference cannot be construed as this Court introducing an additional requirement of cognizance having to be taken within the period prescribed under proviso (a) to Section 167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure, failing which the Accused would be entitled to default bail, even after filing of the charge-sheet within the statutory period. It is not necessary to repeat that in both Madar Sheikh (supra) and M. Ravindran (supra), this Court expressed its view that non-filing of the charge-sheet within the statutory     period    is    the      ground         for  availing   the indefeasible right to claim bail Under Section 167(2), Code of Criminal Procedure. The conundrum relating to the custody of the Accused after the expiry of 60 days has also been dealt with by this Court in Bhikamchand Jain (supra). It was made clear that the Accused remains in custody of the Magistrate till cognizance is taken by the relevant court.. . . ” 6.2   Suresh     Kumar        Bhikamchand                 Jain  Vs.   State    of Maharashtra and Ors. (2013) 1 SCC (LS) 480 wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court, with regard to the provision of law laid down in Section 167 Cr.P.C, observed as under:- “From the above provision, it would be amply clear that the Magistrate may authorise the detention of an accused person, otherwise than in the custody of the police, beyond a period of 15 days, if he is satisfied that there are adequate grounds for doing so, but no Magistrate is authorised to detain the accused person in custody for a total period exceeding 90 days where the investigation relates to an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years and, 60 days where the investigation relates to any other offence. In other words, if an accused was ready to offer bail, once the stipulated period for the investigation had been completed, then the Magistrate no longer had the authority to extend the period of detention beyond the said period of 90 days and, consequently, he had no option but to release the accused on bail. The language used in Sections 167(2)(a)(i) and (ii) is that on the expiry of the period of 90 days or 60 days, as the case may be, the accused person shall be released on bail, if he is prepared to and does furnish bail. The direction upon the learned Magistrate or the Trial Court is mandatory in nature and any detention beyond the said period would be illegal. …once a charge-sheet is filed within the stipulated time, the question of grant of default bail or statutory bail does not arise.. . .Whether cognizance is taken or not is not material as far as Section 167 Code of Criminal Procedure is concerned. . . The scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure is such that once the investigation stage is completed, the Court proceeds to the next stage, which is the taking of cognizance and trial. An accused has to remain in custody of some court. During the period of investigation, the accused is under the custody of the Magistrate before whom he or she is first produced. During that stage, under Section 167(2) Code of Criminal Procedure, the Magistrate is vested with authority to remand the accused to custody, both police custody and/or judicial custody, for 15 days at a time, up to a maximum period of 60 days in cases of offences punishable for less than 10 years and 90 days where the offences are punishable for over 10 years or even death sentence. In the event, an investigating authority fails to file the charge-sheet within the stipulated period, the accused is entitled to be released on statutory bail. In such a situation, the accused continues to remain in the custody of the Magistrate till such time as cognizance is taken by the Court trying the offence, when the said Court assumes custody of the accused for purposes of remand during the trial in terms of Section 309 Code of Criminal Procedure. The two stages are different, but one follows the other so as to maintain a continuity of the custody of the accused with a court.” 7.    On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor opposes, and submits that the learned Court below, vide the impugned order, has rightly held that once a charge sheet has been filed and cognizance has also been taken against the accused–petitioner, the right to claim bail under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. does not subsist.  And    that,   since     the      accused–petitioner    made    the application seeking default/statutory bail after the charge sheet was filed, he relinquished his right to seek bail as a matter of right 8.    Learned Public Prosecutor placed reliance on the following 8.1   Sanjay Dutt Vs. State through C.B.I. Bombay (1994) 5 SCC 410, relevant portion of which reads as under: “(2)(b) The 'indefeasible right' of the accused to be released on bail in accordance with Section 20(4)(bb) of the TADA Act read with Section 167(2) of the CrPC in default of completion of the investigation and filing of the challan within the time allowed, as held in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur is a right which enures to, and is enforceable by the accused only from the time of default till the filing of the challan and it does not survive or remain enforceable on the challan being filed. If the accused applies for bail under this provision on expiry of the period of 180 days or the extended period, as the case may be, then he has to be released on bail forthwith. The accused, so released on bail may be arrested and committed to custody according to the provisions of the CrPC. The right of the accused to be released on bail after filing of the challan, notwithstanding the default in filing it within the time allowed, is governed from the time of filing of the challan only by the provisions relating to the grant of bail applicable at that stage.” 8.2  Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh and Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra (1996) 1 SCC 722, relevant portion of which reads “So far the facts of the present case are concerned, the appellant Nos. 1 to 6 were taken into custody on 16.1.1993. The charge-sheet was submitted on 30.8.1993; obviously beyond the statutory period under Section 20(4)(b). There is nothing on record to show that provisions of Section 20(4(bb) were applied in respect of appellants. They had become entitled to be released on bail under proviso (a) to Section 167(2) of the Code read with Section 20(4)(b) of the TADA. But it is an admitted position that no application for bail appellants. Unless applications had been made on behalf of the appellants, there was no question of their being released on ground of default in completion of the investigation within the statutory period.” 9.    The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the period, during which the accused–petitioner was arrested for the first time, and detained in custody, before which the additional offences were added by the investigation officer, would be computed and therefore the total period of detention of the accused person in custody would exceed 90 days, making him entitled to default/statutory bail. 10.   Heard learned counsel for the parties as well as perused the record of the case and the judgments cited at the Bar. 11.   This Court therefore observes that the following two issues 11.1 Whether the learned Court below, in computing the total period of detention of accused person as under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. , during which the accused – applicant was in custody, was right to exclude the period during which he was previously remained in custody, and subsequently released on bail i.e. before which the additional offences against him were found to be made out by the investigating officer. 11.2 Whether a bail application, under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., seeking default/statutory bail, filed after the charge sheet, although the charge sheet has been filed after the expiry of the prescribed statutory time limit under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., would be maintainable. 12.   This Court observes that the accused–petitioner was initially arrested on 19.10.2021, in connection with alleged commission of offence under Section 363 I.P.C. and was presented before a Magistrate and was granted bail on 20.10.2021. Subsequently, during the period of investigation, the investigating officer filed an application under Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. before the Judicial Magistrate, Osiyan upon finding that the accused– petitioner had allegedly committed offences under other Sections of the I.P.C., namely Sections 457, 342,           366A, 376(2)(n), 376D, along with offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO), namely Sections 3/4, 5(G)/6 which was accepted by the learned Magistrate vide order dated 26.10.2021, while granting permission to the investigating officer to arrest the petitioner. In pursuance of the said order, the petitioner was arrested again on 27.10.2021, and after being presented before the learned Court below on 28.10.2021,                      he was remanded to police   custody.   Subsequently,          on      31.10.2021     the   accused- petitioner was remanded to judicial custody. The charge sheet was filed on 24.01.2022. 13.    This Court further observes that the impugned order, dated 24.02.2022, passed by the learned Court below, states that the accused–petitioner made an application seeking bail before the learned Court below, on 22.02.2022, after the charge sheet was filed, and cognizance of the offences mentioned in the F.I.R. was taken against him, which was within the stipulated period of 90 days as laid down in Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., which was computed 14.    This Court is also conscious of the law laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the following judgments: - 14.1 Achpal & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan (2019) 14 SCC 599, relevant portion of which reads as under: “It   is  thus    clearly     indicated        that    the  stage   of investigation ought to be confined to 90 or 60 days, as the case may be, and thereafter the issue relating to the custody of the Accused ought to be dealt with by the Magistrate on the basis of the investigation. Matters and issues relating to liberty and whether the person Accused of a charge ought to be confined or not, must be decided by the Magistrate and not by the Police. The further custody of such person ought not to be guided by mere suspicion that he may have committed an offence or for that matter, to facilitate pending investigation. The fact of the matter is that as on completion of 90 days of prescribed period Under Section 167 of the Code there were no papers of investigation before the concerned Magistrate. The Accused were thus denied of protection established by law. The issue of their custody had to be considered on merits by the concerned Magistrate and they could not be simply remanded to custody dehors such consideration. The provisions of the Code do not empower anyone to extend the period within which the investigation must be completed nor does it admit of any such eventuality. There     are  enactments          such       as     the    Terrorist   and Disruptive     Activities      (Prevention)              Act,   1985    and Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 which clearly contemplate extension of period and to that   extent     those     enactments             have     modified    the provisions of the Code including Section 167. In the absence of any such similar provision empowering the Court to extend the period, no Court could either directly or indirectly extend such period. We must at this stage note an important feature. In Rakesh Kumar Paul (supra), in his conclusions, Madan B. Lokur, J. The Petitioner is held entitled to the grant of "default bail" on the facts and in the circumstances of this case. The trial Judge should release the Petitioner on "default bail" on such terms and conditions as may be reasonable. However, we make it clear that this does not prohibit or otherwise prevent the arrest or re-arrest of the Petitioner on cogent grounds in respect of the subject charge and upon arrest or re- arrest, the Petitioner is entitled to petition for grant of regular bail which application should be considered on its own merit. We also make it clear that this will not impact on the arrest of the Petitioner in any other case.” 14.2 Rakesh Kumar Paul Vs. State of Assam (2017) 15 SCC 67   wherein    the    Hon’ble       Apex       Court        made    the   following “The significance of the period of 60 days or 90 days, as the case may be, is that if the investigation is not completed      within       that     period        then     the    Accused (assuming he or she is in custody) is entitled to 'default bail' if no charge sheet or challan is filed on the 60th or 90th day, the Accused applies for 'default bail' and is prepared to and does furnish bail for release. Ever since 1898, the legislative intent has been to conclude investigations within twenty-four hours. This intention has not changed for more than a century, as the marginal notes to Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure suggest. However, the Legislature has been pragmatic enough to appreciate   that    it  is   not    always        possible   to   complete investigations into an offence within twenty-four hours. Therefore initially, in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1898, a maximum period of 15 days was provided for completing the investigations. Unfortunately, this limit was being violated through the subterfuge of taking advantage of Section 344 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1898. The misuse was recognized in the 41st Report of the Law Commission of India and consequently the Law Commission recommended fixing a maximum period of 60 days for completing investigations and that recommendation came to be enacted as the law in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973. Subsequently, this period was also found to be insufficient for completing investigations into more serious offences and, as mentioned above, the period for completing investigations was bifurcated into 90 days for some offences and 60 days for the remaining Notwithstanding this, the basic legislative intent of completing investigations within twenty-four hours and also within an otherwise time-bound period remains unchanged, even though that period has been extended over the years. This is an indication that in addition to giving adequate time to complete investigations, the Legislature has also and always put a premium on personal liberty and has always felt that it would be unfair to an Accused to remain in custody for a prolonged or indefinite period. What is forgotten is that the indefeasible right for 'default bail' accrued to the Petitioner when the period of 60 days for completing the investigation and filing a charge sheet came to an end on 3rd or 4th January, 2017 and that the indefeasible right continued till 24th January, 2017. The question is whether during this interregnum the Petitioner was entitled to 'default bail' or not? Ordinarily, the answer would be "yes" but in the present case, the Petitioner was not granted bail and a charge sheet was filed against him on 24th January, 2017. Was his indefeasible right completely taken away? The Constitution Bench in Sanjay Dutt made it clear in paragraph 48 of the Report that the indefeasible right accruing to the Accused is enforceable only prior to the filing of the charge sheet and it does not survive or remain enforceable thereafter, if already not availed of. In other words, the Constitution Bench took the view that the indefeasible right of 'default bail' continues till the   charge     sheet      or    challan        is   filed   and   it gets extinguished thereafter. This Court had occasion to review the entire case law on the subject in Union of India v. Nirala Yadav MANU/SC/0580/2014 : (2014) 9 SCC 457. In that decision, reference was made to Uday     Mohanlal      Acharya          v.     State       of   Maharashtra MANU/SC/0222/2001 : (2001) 5 SCC 453 and the conclusions arrived at in that decision. We are concerned with conclusion (3) On the expiry of the said period of 90 days or 60 days, as the case may be, an indefeasible right accrues in favour of the Accused for being released on bail on account of default by the investigating agency in the completion of the investigation within the period prescribed and the Accused is entitled to be released on bail, if he is prepared to and furnishes the bail as directed by the Magistrate. This Court also dealt with the decision rendered in Sanjay Dutt and     noted    that    the     principle         laid    down    by   the Constitution Bench is to the effect that if the charge sheet is not filed and the right for 'default bail' has ripened into the status of indefeasibility, it cannot be frustrated by the prosecution on any pretext. The Accused can avail his liberty by filing an application stating that the statutory period for filing the charge sheet or challan has expired and the same has not yet been filed and therefore the indefeasible right has accrued in his or her favour and further the Accused is prepared to furnish the bail bond. It is not as if the Petitioner did not make any application for default bail-such an application was definitely made (if not in writing) then at least orally before the High Court. In our opinion, in matters of personal liberty, we cannot and should not be too technical and must lean in favour of personal liberty. Consequently, whether the Accused makes a written application for 'default bail' or an oral application for 'default bail' is of no consequence. The concerned court must deal with such an application by considering the statutory requirements namely, whether the statutory period for filing a charge sheet or challan has expired, whether the charge sheet or challan has been filed and whether the Accused is prepared to and does furnish bail. 41. We take this view keeping in mind that in   matters    of   personal      liberty     and      Article 21  of   the Constitution, it is not always advisable to be formalistic or … it would equally be the duty and responsibility of a court on coming to know that the Accused person before it is entitled to 'default bail', to at least apprise him or her of the indefeasible right. A contrary view would diminish the respect for personal liberty, on which so much emphasis has been laid by this … when the High Court dismissed the application for bail filed by the Petitioner, he had an indefeasible right to the grant of 'default bail' since the statutory period of 60 days for filing a charge sheet had expired, no charge sheet or challan had been filed against him (it was filed only on 24th January, 2017) and the Petitioner had orally applied for 'default bail'. Under these circumstances, the only course open to the High Court on 11th January, 2017 was to enquire from the Petitioner whether he was prepared to furnish bail and if so then to grant him 'default bail' on reasonable conditions. Unfortunately, this was completely overlooked by the High It would have been another matter altogether if the Petitioner had not applied for 'default bail' for whatever reason during this interregnum” of Revenue Intelligence (2021) 2 SCC 485 wherein the “The right to be released on default bail continues to remain enforceable if the Accused has applied for such bail, notwithstanding pendency of the bail application; or subsequent filing of the chargesheet or a report seeking extension of time by the prosecution before the Court; or filing of the chargesheet during the interregnum when challenge to the rejection of the bail application is pending before a higher 15.   This Court further observes, as aforementioned, that the accused-petitioner was first arrested and taken into custody for a period of one day, when an offence under Section 363 I.P.C. was found to be made out against him. And that the accused-petitioner was produced before a Magistrate the very next day, and was granted bail on 20.10.2021, the same day. 16.   It is clear from the record, and from what has been enumerated above that the petitioner was, after the aforesaid order, re-arrested on 27.10.2021 upon fresh inclusion of the alleged offences under Sections 457, 342, 366A, 376(2)(n), 376D IPC, along with Sections 3/4, 5(G)/6 of the POCSO Act, and the charge-sheet was filed on 24.01.2022. 17.   A bare perusal of Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. reveals that under sub-section (2) (a) (I) of 167 Cr.P.C., the period of 90 days would be computed when the investigation, with regard to that particular offence(s), began. The offence under Section 363 I.P.C. would attract the application of Section 167 sub-section (2) (a) (ii) of Cr.P.C. since the maximum / upper limit period of imprisonment under the said section would be 60 days. Regardless of that fact, this Court finds that if an additional or new offence(s) are found to be made out by the investigating authority, against an accused, then the computation of the period, as laid down under Section 167 Cr.P.C. would be done afresh. 17.1 Owing to the present facts and circumstances, such is the position in the present case, wherein new offences were found to be made out against the accused–petitioner, by the investigating officer during the course of investigation. 18.   This Court, in light of the aforementioned, finds that the learned    Court   below,      after       appreciating        relevant   judicial precedents, has rightly found that the total period of detention of the accused-petitioner have to begun from 27.10.2021, until when the charge sheet was filed on 24.01.2022. And therefore, the charge sheet was rightly filed within the stipulated 90 days’ time period as laid down under Section 167 (2) (a) (I) Cr.P.C. 19.    In the present case, the accused–petitioner preferred an application seeking bail, under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C, on 22.02.2022 before the learned court below, at a belated stage of about 29 days after the charge sheet was                            filed, i.e. on 20.    Thus, the first issue is answered as that the period of 90 days is stated to be counted when the investigation for the fresh offence(s) is started and not from the date of lodging of the FIR. 20.1 The second issue once attached to the controversy is also answered in the following paragraphs in accordance with the settled law as laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court. 21.    In Suresh Kumar Bhikamchand Jain (supra), the Hon’ble Apex Court reiterated the decision of the Hon’ble Constitution Bench in Sanjay Dutt (supra) stating that the right to default/statutory bail accrues to the accused, and gains the status of an ‘indefeasible right’ only after the expiry of the total period as laid down in Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. and until the charge-sheet is subsequently filed. 21.1 The Hon’ble Apex Court in Sanjay Dutt (supra), laid down in   clear  and   cogent      terms       that      the     indefeasible   right   of default/statutory    bail,   accruing        to      the     accused,   who    is  in detention/custody, is enforceable only prior to filing of the charge- sheet and it does not survive once the charge-sheet has been filed; unless, the said right had already been availed of. 21.2 This implies that if the accused had made an application seeking bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. after the expiry of the total period laid down in the said provision, but before the charge- sheet is filed, the pendency of such an application would not affect his right to seek such bail, even in case of filing of the charge- sheet prior to adjudication on such application. 22.   In both the aforesaid cases, and in Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh (supra), the Hon’ble Apex Court held that the said right to seek default/statutory bail may be availed only after an application for the same has been made by the accused, or on behalf of the accused–applicant before the concerned Magistrate. 23.   Further, in Achpal (supra) it has been clarified that unless an extension to such a total period of detention of an accused, as laid down under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C, was prescribed by a particular statute, the Courts would not be empowered to grant any extension of time for detention of an accused or overlook the delay in filing the charge sheet in case an application seeking bail by the accused person(s) has been preferred. 24.   The Hon’ble Apex Court, in Rakesh Kumar Paul (supra), after delving deep into statutory interpretation of legislation, and the right to life and personal liberty of an accused, and in M. Ravindran (supra), reinforced the ratio decidendi, as laid down in aforementioned case laws, and held that the indefeasible right accruing to the accused is enforceable only prior to the filing of the    charge     sheet,     and       therefore,          the  right   to    seek default/statutory bail only remains until the charge sheet is filed, and is extinguished as soon as the charge sheet is filed, once the statutory period as laid down under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. has 25.   This Court answers the second issue as that if a bail application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., seeking default/statutory bail, if filed after filing of the charge-sheet, even if the charge- sheet has been filed after expiry of the prescribed statutory time limit, under the said provision of law, would not in fact be maintainable. 26.    Therefore, what is of utmost significance is whether the application seeking default/statutory bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. has been made before filing of the charge-sheet, or not; and the said right of the accused becomes an indefeasible right only in the circumstance that the prescribed total period has expired     and   the    charge-sheet          has       not     been    filed.  Other surrounding circumstances are however, immaterial solely with regard to such right, in such attending circumstances. 27.    This   Court    hereby       observes         that      the   right    to  seek default/statutory bail accrues to the accused in the nature of an indefeasible    right,    only    if    such       remedy         by   preferring   an appropriate application has been availed of within the prescribed window from the date of expiry of total period of detention of accused person(s) under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., until filing of the charge-sheet. 28.    This Court, in light of the praefatus observations, finds that the impugned order passed by the learned Court below does not suffer from any legal infirmity so as to warrant any interference by this Court. 29.    Consequently, the present petition is dismissed. All pending applications stand disposed of.
.      Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. With the consent of parties, matter is taken up for final hearing. 2.     By     this      petition,   petitioner challenges       order       dated 21.09.2022 passed by the District Judge – 2, Kopergaon on application below Exhibit 236 by which his defence has been struck off. He also challenges the order dated 30.09.2022, by which application filed for recall of order dated 21.09.2022 has been rejected. 3.     In the custody battle between petitioner-father and respondent No. 1-mother, an order came to be passed by the District Court on 27th August, 2020 granting visitation rights in favour of the mother on every Wednesday between 11.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon in the Court premises. Later, the order was modified on 05th August, 2022 granting visitation rights to mother from 11.00 a.m. to 01.00 p.m. on each Sunday at Shri Swami Samarth 4.     The mother moved an application for striking off the defence of petitioner on account of repeated violation of the order passed by the Court. The application was allowed on 21.09.2022 and the defence of petitioner was struck off under the provisions of the Order XXXIX Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Petitioner moved an application for recall of that order and for restoration of his defence, which has been rejected by order dated 30th September, 2022 by the District Court. 5.     Appearing for petitioner, Mr. Kulkarni the learned counsel would submit that the child is not willing to meet the mother. This is essentially the reason why order granting visitation rights could not be complied with on certain dates. He submits that the matter is required to be referred to a counsellor to gauge child’s inclination to meet mother, rather than striking off petitioner’s defence for technical violation of court’s order. He would submit that child’s wish is paramount and therefore, when the child himself is not willing to meet the mother, the Court ought not to have straightway struck off defence without exploring the possibility of referring the matter to a counsellor. Mr. Kulkarni would further submit that the order striking off the defence is of drastic nature and ought not to have been passed by the Court in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. In support of his contention Mr. Kulkarni would rely upon decision of this Court in Kavita Krishnamurti Vs. K. N. Krishnamurti reported in MANU/MH/2331/2014. 6.     Per contra, Mrs. Sangit, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 opposes the petition. She would submit that there has been repeated violation of the order granting visitation rights by the petitioner and that therefore, the District Court has correctly struck off his defence. She would in particular draw my attention to the observations recorded by the District Court in its order dated 21.01.2021 regarding behaviour of the petitioner in the Court. She relies upon para Nos. 2 to 5 and 8 of that order, which reads thus : “2.     Respondent no. 1 was told at 4.30 p.m. today in clear terms that he should reach his son at home and ask his advocate to remain present for argument on Exh.122. But respondent no. 1 made allegations on the court that this court never told this to him.              He further made allegations on the court that the court wants that all the proceeding should happen behind his back thereby indicating that till now all the orders came to be passed by this court behind his back without giving him opportunity of being heard. When this objectionable statement is pointed out to respondent no.1 and he is told that this is going to be recorded, he made arrogant statement that Þeh ;sFksp Fkkacrks vkf.k c?kqu ?ksrksß (When this statement was recorded, respondent no.1 again created hindrance by stating that he never addressed to court                Þc?kqu ?ksrksß thereby making allegations against court that this court is falsely recording those words.          The words    Þc?kqu ?ksrksß   in such arrogant tone and on such a timing gives a feeling to the court that respondent no.1 is threating the Court of dire consequences. 3.      Since this matter is assigned to this court it has come to notice of this Court that respondent no1 intentionally indulged into making allegation on the court and the staff. He filed a false complaint against senior clerk Shri. Aher of this court in the part just because he did not write the roznama to suit the respondent no.1. 4.      This court also noticed that respondent no.1 abuses petitioner in court by using unparliamentary language. On one occasion in front of his father, who is respondent no. 3 in this petition, respondent no. 1 used the words Þx/kGh o c;rkGß for the petitioner in open Court.           The word Gadhali means donkey and the word Baytai means mad. (At this pint of time respondent no.1 again interrupted this court and said that he never uttered the word                Þc;rkGß for the petitioner, thereby again making allegations on the court that this court is creating a wrong record). After this the respondent no.1 submitted that when petitioner made allegations against him that he is responsible for her 6 abortions, at that time, he uttered the word                   Þx/kGhß for petitioner. By making this submission respondent no. 1 admitted in open court that he used the said word for petition. The father of respondent no.1 intervened on the said occasion and asked respondent no.1 not to use unparliamentary language in court.          A record of those words was not prepared by this court at that time just because the respondent no.1 is a practicing advocate and this court did not want the career of respondent no1 would suffer. 5.      It is observed by this Curt that every small thing respondent no1 prepares videos of his son to create a record to prove that by passing of order of visitation rights in favour of petitioner this court has committed a blunder. 8.      As per visitation rights order clear directions were given to respondent no.1 not to remain present near his son or in such area where he could be visible to his son so that his son does not get intimated while meeting the petitioner. But on every date of visitation right he is disobeying the said order willfully by keeping his son next to him during the visitation is going on. Whenever his son tries to go near the petitioner he calls him back. He does not allow the petitioner to take her son close to her. On one occasion when the petitioner took her son on the second floor of the building to interact with him, the respondent no.1 created a scene. The petitioner brought her son safely in the court hall after about half an hour. But the respondent no.1 made an issue that his son suffered head injury as petitioner took him on the second floor. When his son was taken close by me and I personally verified about any injury to his son, I did not find any injury or even pain to his son. After the court was over the respondent no.1 went to his chamber and made a video of his son wherein his son was crying and saying that he suffered injury on his head. This shows that things which never happened are projected by respondent no.1 in such a way so as to suit his purpose and can be used against petitioner.” 7.     Mrs. Sangeet would further submit that there has been intentional disobedience of the order on the part of the petitioner. Even after passing of the order dated 30.09.2022, the petitioner has not granted any visitation rights to the respondent No. 1 till date. 8.     After having heard learned counsel for the parties, it is clear that non-grant of visitation rights by the petitioner to the respondent No. 1 is not under dispute. What the petitioner essentially contends is that the disobedience of the order is not intentional. The pretext of disinclination of child to meet mother has been presented for non-following the order passed by the Court.     It is apparent that on 21.09.2022, when the District Court proceeded to strike off the defence of the petitioner, there were as many as eleven violations of the visitation rights on the part of the petitioner.    During the period from 07.08.2022 to 04.09.2022, as well the petitioner seems to have obstructed the child during his visit with mother on 25.09.2022 and indulged in the act of video shooting the incidence. The Court has observed that on 25.09.2022, the petitioner created obstacle in the visitation right by going close to the child. 9.     So far as the contention of Mr. Kulkarni that the matter is required to be referred to a counsellor, it appears that such an attempt was earlier made by the petitioner and by order passed on 21.09.2022, petitioner’s request for referring the matter to the counsellor was set aside. It must be borne in mind that present petition does not challenge the order granting visitation rights. Therefore, the question of revisiting that order by referring the matter to the counsellor for verifying the inclination of the child to visit his mother does not arise. 10.    The situation that emerges before me is that the order granting visitation rights passed on 27.08.2020 as modified by the Court on 05.08.2022 has attained finality. Petitioner’s request for verifying the disinclination of the child to meet mother by referring the matter to a counsel has also been rejected by order dated 21.09.2022. That order has also attained finality. In such a situation, it was not open for the petitioner to deny visitation rights to the mother on the pretext of disinclination of the child to meet the mother. 11.    True it is that the order striking off defence is drastic one which should be avoided by the Courts. In normal circumstances, the Court would have recourse to such a drastic order only after it arrives at finding that there is something more than mere violation and that there is a willful breach of the order. 12.    In its order, the District Court has recorded specific finding that the petitioner has intentionally committed breach of the interim order and that there is intentional disobedience on the part of the petitioner. Para 10 of the order passed by the District “10. So far as, the present proceeding is concerned, the record does speak of volumes. On apparent perusal of some documents on record, the very conduct of non- applicant no.1 in disobeying the interim order of visitation is very much glaring and evident. This Court observes that, there are applications at Exh. Nos.66, 82, 143, 175, 176, 180, 183, 201, 208, 210 and Exh. 212. ON apparent perusal of these applications, it may be noted that, non- applicant no. 1 has not allowed the applicant to meet son Reyansh in past also. To this, there is no categorical account or explanation coming-forth on behalf of non- applicant no.1.    Apart from the aforesaid voluminous documents, which shows intentional disobedience of interim order of this Court by non-applicant no.1, the very observations recorded by my Ld. Predecessor equally speaks of volumes and throw light on attitude of non- applicant no.1 in flouting the interim order of this Court as to visitation. In this premise, the order of this Court dated 21/01/2021 below Exhibit.1, particularly across paragraph nos. 8 and 9 are self-speaking. It is categorically observed by the Ld. Predecessor of this Court as below- But on every date of visitation right he is disobeying the said order willfully by keeping his son next to him during the visitation is going on. Whenever his son tries to go near the petitioner he calls him back. He does not allow the petitioner to take her son close to her. On one occasion when the petitioner took her son on the second floor of the building to interact with him, the respondent no.1 created a scene. The petitioner brought her son safely in the court hall after about half an hour. 13.    Thus, the issue as to whether there is an intentional violation on the part of the petitioner has already been gone into by the District Court and a finding of fact is recorded that the petitioner has intentionally committed disobedience of the order. 14.    Reliance of Mr. Kulkarni on the judgment of this Court in Kavita Krishnamurti (supra) would be of little assistance to the petitioner as this Court has observed in that case that no specific finding of willful disobedience was recorded by the Family Court while passing the order of striking off defence. As against this, in the present case a specific finding has been recorded by the District Court to the effect that the petitioner has committed intentional disobedience of the interim orders passed by the 15.    Also of relevance is the fact that after passing order dated 21.09.2022 striking off the defence as well as after passing of the order dated 30.09.2022 rejecting application for recalling of that order, Petitioner has once again defaulted on grant of visitation rights in favour of the mother. In these circumstances, I do not feel that any error is committed by the District Court in passing the impugned orders. 16.    The child today is eight years old and the mother has been granted visitation rights for only two hours in a week. During custody battle pending for 3 years, the child has grown from 5 years to 8 years. It is really unfortunate that father is creating hurdles and preventing the mother from meeting the child. Petitioner’s conduct in Court as reflected in the order dated 21.01.2022 extracted hereinabove also speaks volumes about lack of bonafides. Petitioner appears to be attempting to frustrate the order granting visitation rights in a indirect manner. 17.    After the judgment was dictated in open court, Mr. Kulkarni, learned counsel for the petitioner has tendered across the bar an undertaking of the petitioner dated 17.10.2022 to follow and abide by the orders passed by the District Court regarding visitation rights. Said undertaking is taken on record. In my opinion, Petitioner ought to have shown remorse before the District Court in respect of his conduct and improved upon his behaviour atleast after his defence was struck off. Far from doing so, he sought to justify his conduct on the pretext of disinclination of child to meet the mother. However, his incalcitrant attitude has continued even after passing of impugned orders. The contention of child’s disinclination to meet mother and plea for referring the child to counsellor were strenuously pressed before me. It is only after the judgment is dictated that the undertaking is tendered. Counsel appearing for the Respondent has opposed modification of the present judgment by taking into consideration Petitioner’s undertaking. In such circumstances, tendering of such undertaking at a belated stage is inconsequential. Petitioner is otherwise bound by the orders passed by the District Court even after his defence has been struck off. 18.             Petition is devoid of merits. It is dismissed without any orders as to costs. Rule is discharged.
Mr.Subhash Jha with Mr.Harekrishna Mishra i/b. Mr.Anirudh Ganu for the Petitioner. Mrs.A.S.Pai, Public Prosecutor for the Respondents. By this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the Petitioner is seeking the following prayer: “(b) to issue a writ of certiorari and/or any other appropriate writ, order and or direction in the nature of certiorari thereby calling for the investigation papers concerning FIR No.124 of 2022 of Naupada police station, Thane and so also investigation papers concerning FIR No.470/22 of Goregaon police station, Mumbai and investigation papers of FIR No.165 of 2022 of Dindori Police Station, Nashik, FiR No,.83 of 2022 of Cyber Police Station, Shivajinagar, Pune, as well as other FIRs/complaints, if any, received in respect of or skn                                     2               21-WP-1821.2022.doc concerning the impugned tweet dated 11th May, 2022, being Exhibit-’B’ annexed herewith, the same my be pleased to quash and set aside.” 2.           List the petition for further hearing on 12 July 2022. 3.           The learned counsel for the Petitioner prays for the grant of interim relief that the Petitioner be directed to be released on bail. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties on this interim 4.           Several FIRs came to be filed against the Petitioner. (i) FIR No.124/2022 at Naupada Police Station, Thane, on 13 May 2022 at 20.10 hours for the offence punishable under sections 107, 153, 153(A), 504, 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was in respect of a post stated to be put up by the Petitioner on the social media platform “Twitter” on 11 May 2022. (ii)   In respect of the same tweet, FIR No.165/2022 was filed at Dindori Police Station, Nashik, on 14 May 2022; (iii) FIR No.13/2022 at Cyber Cell, Pune city on 14 May 2022; (iv)   FIR No.570/2022 at Goregaon Police Station, Mumbai on 14 (v)    FIR No. 502/2022 at Bhoiwada Police Station, Mumbai on 14 (vi)   FIR No.292/2022 at Dehu Road Police Station, Pimpri Chinchwad on 15 May 2022. 5.           It is common ground that these FIRs relate to the same post on social media and are on the same allegations. The gist of the allegations is that the Petitioner posted a message on the social media platform, which was in respect of a senior political leader of the ruling political party in the State, which post was intended to promote enmity in different groups on religion, place of birth, language etc. 6.           The Petitioner was arrested in respect of the offence registered at Dindori Police Station, Nashik, Naupada Police Station, Thane, Cyber Cell, Pune city and Dehu Road Police Station, Pimpri Chinchwad on 13 May 2022.            As regards the FIR registered at Dindori Police Station and Dehu Road Police Station, the Petitioner has been released on bail by the learned Magistrate. As regards FIR registered at Naupada Police Station and Cyber Cell, the Petitioner filed applications before the learned Magistrate, which were rejected. Regarding the order of rejection and for grant of bail, the Petitioner and the State have not taken any further steps.        As a result, the Petitioner has continued to be in custody since 13 May 2022. 7.           The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this is a fit case where the prayer for grant of interim bail in a petition seeking to quash FIR needs to be considered.         The learned counsel for the Petitioner relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of skn                                    4               21-WP-1821.2022.doc Arnab Manoranjan Goswami v. the State of Maharashtra 1.                   The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Petitioner is a student and all that he has done is a message on the social media, and the FIR in respect of the said post do not prima facie indicate that any offence is made out.        The learned counsel further submitted that the continued custody of the Petitioner is entirely unwarranted and keeping the Petitioner in custody has serious repercussions on the society.      The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that for the same post series of FIRs have been filed, which is entirely unwarranted and impermissible in law.             The learned counsel submitted that it would be unjust to drive the Petitioner to different courts seeking bail in different FIRs.     The learned counsel further submitted that it is not the case where the Petitioner would abuse the liberty or tamper with the investigation if released on bail. 8.             The learned PP submitted that though it is correct that interim bail in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and under section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing of FIR can be considered, at the same time as stated in the decision in the case of Arnab Manoranjan Goswami, the High Court will have to keep in mind that exercise of power must be in circumspection and not a substitute for the remedy of bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C. Learned PP submitted that the Petitioner has antecedents and an FIR No.134/2022 was lodged against the Petitioner at Vartaknagar Police Station under section 294, 500, 507 of IPC read with section 66(a) skn                                    5                21-WP-1821.2022.doc 9.           In the decision of Arnab Manoranjan Goswami, the Supreme Court has considered the ambit of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and under section 482 of Cr.P.C. for grant of interim bail in a petition filed for quashing of FIR.             The Supreme Court has observed that the High Court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of powers when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of personal liberty in the exercise of State powers, apart from other parameters for consideration of bail. The interest of the public or State or other considerations also have to be kept in mind. We have considered rival contentions in the context of the above position of law for consideration of the prayer.              For this purpose, the totality of the circumstances will have to be considered. 10.          The Petitioner is a 22-year-old student.          The earlier incident referred to by the learned PP is also in respect of electronic communication. Apart from this, we have not been shown any antecedents of the Petitioner. It cannot be said at this stage that the argument of the Petitioner that bare perusal of the contents of the Petitioner's post and the FIR, ingredient of the offence creating disharmony between two groups is not made out, is incorrect. Prima facie, we also find merit in the contention of the Petitioner that multiple FIRs for the same post in different cities were against the position of law and have resulted in great prejudice against the Petitioner, a student who has to apply in different courts for bail. skn                                    6              21-WP-1821.2022.doc Regarding two such FIRs, the Petitioner has been granted bail, and the State has not challenged the same. It has not been demonstrated before us that if the Petitioner is released on bail, he will abuse the liberty or interfere with the investigation.   Therefore, taking these factors cumulatively, we find that a case is made out for the grant of interim bail to the Petitioner. 11.           The learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Petitioner has been released on bail on furnishing PR Bond of Rs.15,000/- with solvent surety by the Judicial Magistrate, Dindori and every FIR and bail order the Petitioner should not be directed to give solvent surety. The request made is reasonable. 12.           Hence, the following order: (i)           In respect of FIR No.124/2022 registered with Naupada Police Station, Thane and FIR No.13/2022 registered with Cyber Cell, Pune City, the Petitioner shall be released on bail after furnishing P.R.Bond of Rs.15,000/-; (ii)   In respect of FIR No.570/2022 registered with Goregaon Police Station, Mumbai and FIR No.502/2022 registered with Bhoiwada Police Station, Mumbai, the Petitioner shall not be arrested till further orders; As regards the conditions of bail, they have been so provided skn                                      7              21-WP-1821.2022.doc in the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate in respect of FIR No.165/2022, and it is not necessary to direct any separate conditions in this order.      The Petitioner is also asked to mark his attendance at Dindori Police Station every Sunday, which according to us, will suffice for the interim bail. 13.           Stand over to 12 July 2022. Reply, if any, to be filed before the next date.
438 CR.P.C. No. - 4645 of 2022 Counsel for Applicant :- Ramesh Chandra Yadav,Ramashray Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A. 1.     Heard Sri Ramesh Chandra Yadav, learned counsel for the applicant and the learned Additional Government Advocate for the 2.     By means of present anticipatory bail application, the applicant has shown his apprehension of arrest in Case Crime No. 240 of 2021 u/s 147, 323,354,504, 506, 376 I.P.C., P.S, Shadiyabad, District Ghazipur. Learned counsel has submitted that the applicant 3.     The attention has been drawn towards the impugned F.I.R. wherein the present applicant is not named and no allegation of any kind whatsoever has been leveled against him. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that having ulterior motive and extraneous design in her mind the informant has deliberately and intentionally not named the present applicant in the F.I.R. as she has stated herself as wife of the present applicant. At the time of lodging of F.I.R. she has given impression that she is wife of the present 4.     The present applicant is an Army personnel serving in Indian Army, presently posted at Line of Control, China Border. He has got married with one Priya Yadav as certificate of marriage to that effect has been enclosed with the application as Annexure no. 4. 5.     The learned counsel has further submitted that the present applicant is not married to the informant / complainant. Since the informant / complainant is not married wife of the applicant, therefore, she could have not entered into the house of the present applicant in his absence showing herself as his wife when his family members were fully aware that he is married to Priya Yadav. 6.    However, while recording her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C., as per para 10 of the anticipatory bail rejection order passed by the learned court below, the complainant / informant has stated that she was having affair with present applicant since long and they got married in one temple. 7.    Sri Yadav has submitted that no credible evidence has been provided to the investigating officer by the informant / complainant and the investigation is still going on. 8.    The present applicant is posted at Line of Control, China Border and he could not know about any investigation being pending. As a matter of fact no summon to cooperate with the investigation is served upon the applicant nor any bailable or non- bailable warrant has been served upon the present applicant to cooperate with the investigation. 9.    This Court in re: Vinod Kumar Singh @ Vinod Singh vs. State of U.P. in Case No. 5195 of 2021 vide order dated 10.12.2021 was pleased to set aside the proclamation issued u/s 82 Cr.P.C. for the reason that before seeking proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. the investigating officer has not taken prior steps and has not filed such application before the learned court below on affidavit. Therefore, in the aforesaid case the direction was issued to Director General of Police, U.P. to issue appropriate circular fixing guidelines to the effect that the investigating officer shall file affidavit before the court concerned apprising that he has taken all necessary steps seeking cooperation of the accused but the accused is not cooperating with the investigation. 10.   In the present case no such affidavit has been filed by the Investigating Officer and no material was shown to the court-below to convince that before issuing proclamation all prior necessary measures have been adopted by the Investigating officer concerned. 11.    The Apex Court in re: Inder Mohan Goswami & another vs. State of Uttaranchal & others reported in (2007) 12 SCC 1 has held that coercive process i.e. N.B.W. should not be issued lightly and it is incumbent upon the Court to verify such fact as to whether all prior necessory steps have been taken by the investigating officer or not. Therefore, as per Sri Yadav unless the prior necessary steps, so prescribed under the Cr.P.C., have not been taken by the investigating officer, the proclamation u/s 82 and 83 Cr.P.C. should not have been issued. The relevant paras of Inder Mohan Goswami (supra) are being reproduced herein below : 51. The issuance of non-bailable warrants involves interference with personal liberty. Arrest and imprisonment means deprivation of the most precious right of an individual. Therefore, the courts have to be extremely careful before issuing non-bailable warrants. 52. Just as liberty is precious for an individual so is the interest of the society in maintaining law and order. Both are extremely important for the survival of a civilized society. Sometimes in the larger interest of the Public and the State it becomes absolutely imperative to curtail freedom of an individual for a certain period, only then the non-bailable warrants should be issued. 54. As far as possible, if the court is of the opinion that a summon will suffice in getting the appearance of the accused in the court, the summon or the bailable warrants should be preferred. The warrants either bailable or non-bailable should never be issued without proper scrutiny of facts and complete application of mind, due to the extremely serious consequences and ramifications which ensue on issuance of warrants. The court must very carefully examine whether the Criminal Complaint or FIR has not been filed with an oblique motive.” 12.    Therefore, as per Sri Yadav the proclamation, so issued against the present applicant is nonest in the eyes of law in view of the decision of Apex Court in re: Inder Mohan Goswami (supra). 13.    Sri Yadav has further submitted that the present applicant has filed anticipatory bail application before the learned court-below prior to issuance of proclamation issued u/s 82 and 83 Cr.P.C. inasmuch as his anticipatory bail application was filed in the month of April, 2022 and has been rejected on 30.4.2022. The proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. has been issued by the court-below on 9.5.2022. Therefore, Sri Yadav has submitted that the bar so imposed by Apex Court to the effect that if the proclamation u/s 82 and 83 Cr.P.C. is issued, no anticipatory bail application can be entertained would not be attracted in the instant case inasmuch as when the present applicant has filed his anticipatory bail application before the court below, there was no proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. Admittedly, such proclamation is issued after rejection of his anticipatory bail application by the learned court below. 14.    The law is trite on the point that, if any person has filed any anticipatory bail application before the learned court below seeking anticipatory bail showing his reasonable apprehension of arrest in a case where the allegations of the prosecution prima facie do not corroborate with the material available on record and his / her anticipatory bail application is rejected, he / she has got a right to approach the High Court for such anticipatory bail and if in the interregnum period any proclamation u/s 82 & 83 Cr.P.C. is issued, it may be considered as a circumventive exercise being taken by the Investigating Officer. No one can be restrained from taking legal recourse strictly in accordance with law and such legal right may not be prevented even if any process is adopted by any authority which is not permissible under the law. 15.    As per Sri Yadav since the present applicant is an Army personnel and presently posted at Line of Control, China Border, so the investigating officer / police concerned should have not harassed him and his family members in an issue wherein the allegations do not prima facie corroborate with the material available on record. Therefore, the liberty of the present applicant may be protected in view of dictum of Apex Court in re: Sushila Aggarwal Vs. State (NCT of Delhi)-2020 SCC online SC 98. 16.   Per contra, learned AGA has opposed the prayer of anticipatory bail but could not dispute the factual and legal submissions of Sri Yadav, learned counsel for the applicant. Learned AGA has submitted that the investigation is going on. 17.   Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. 18.   The Hon'ble Apex Court in re: State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Pradeep Sharma reported in (2014) 2 SCC 171 has held that a person against whom a proclamation has been issued u/s 82/83 Cr.P.C. would not be entitled for the benefit of anticipatory bail. 19.   Considering the aforesaid judgment i.e.: Pradeep Sharma (supra) the Apex Court in re: Prem Shanker Prasad vs. State of Bihar (Criminal Appeal No. 1209 of 2021) vide judgment and order dated October 21,2021 has observed that if anyone is declared as an absconder / proclaimed offender in terms of section 82 of the Code (Cr.P.C.), he is not entitled to get the relief of anticipatory bail. 20.   In view of the aforesaid decision of Apex Court in re: Pradeep Sharma (supra) and Prem Shankar Prasad (supra) if any accused person is declared absconder by the competent court, he would not be entitled to get anticipatory bail. 21.   In the present case the record reveals that when the applicant has filed the anticipatory bail application before the learned court below there was no proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. Such proclamation has been issued after the rejection of anticipatory bail application of the present applicant by the learned court below, therefore, the bar to   entertain   anticipatory   bail     application after   issuance     of proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. would not be attracted in the present 22.   The anticipatory bail application can be filed u/s 438 Cr.P.C. either before the High Court or before the court of sessions. However, normally a person should approach the Court of sessions and if the anticipatory bail application is rejected, the High Court can be approached under same section i.e. section 438 Cr.P.C. Therefore, for filing anticipatory bail application both the aforesaid courts have got concurrent powers. 23.    In the present case it appears that when the anticipatory bail application of the present applicant was rejected on 30.4.2022, an application for seeking proclamation order was filed by the Investigating Officer and such order has been issued on 9.5.2022. Further, the proclamation order dated 9.5.2022 does not disclose that the investigating officer has filed an affidavit before the learned court concerned to convince that all prior steps which are required under the law have been taken; as to whether the summons, bailable warrant and non-bailable warrant have been served upon the applicant or not; as to whether before issuing the non-bailable warrant against the present applicant the learned court below has convinced itself about the service of summons and bailable warrants. 24.    In the present case the informant / complainant has not leveled any allegation against the present applicant in the F.I.R. As a matter of fact, the present applicant is not named in the F.I.R.. It is beyond any comprehension that if the informant / complainant was having any grievance, more so genuine grievance against the present applicant, any sort of allegation would have been leveled in the F.I.R., therefore, the allegations are subject to the investigation which is under progress and it is legitimately expected that such investigation    shall  be   conducted     and    concluded    strictly in accordance with law. 25.    The Apex Court has restrained the proclaimed offender to seek anticipatory bail. The person who is not following the process of law and deliberately avoiding the investigation despite all necessary steps have been taken by the investigating officer to apprise him to cooperate with the process of investigation, e.g. summons have been served but to no avail, thereafter bailable warrants have been served but again he / she is not cooperating with the investigation for no plausible and cogent reasons, lastly non-bailable warrant has / have been served but there is no heed thereon, then the investigation officer has got no option except to seek proclamation u/s 82 / 83 Cr.P.C. It is also relevant to note here that the court concerned must ensure before taking any coercive steps that all the aforesaid proceed, i.e. summons, bailable warrants and non-bailable warrants have been duly served upon the person and he / she is deliberately avoiding the same. Issuing summons, bailable warrant and non-bailable warrants would not suffice but what is most important is its service upon the person because unless and until such process is served no further coercive step should be taken in view of the dictum of Apex Court in re: Inder Mohan Goswami (supra) inasmuch as these coercive steps are directly related with the liberty of the person which is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 26.   Therefore, if the aforesaid process is avoided by the person, any appropriate application for seeking proclamation can be filed by the investigating officer supporting with an affidavit to apprise the court concerned as to how despite the summon, bailable warrant and non-bailable warrant having been served upon the person he / she is deliberately avoiding to cooperate with the investigation and the court after having proper satisfaction on the averments of such application may issue proclamation. Only under these circumstances that person may be declared as proclaimed offender and his / her anticipatory bail application should not be heard. In other words, before filing anticipatory bail that person should be proclaimed offender and his / her anticipatory bail application will loose the right of hearing on merits. 27.   In the present case when the applicant filed his anticipatory bail application, he was not a proclaimed offender. His right to file such application before this court was consequential as he could have approached the High Court u/s 438 Cr.P.C. after rejection of his application by the sessions court which was also filed u/s 438 Cr.P.C. Therefore, when the present applicant filed his application u/s 438 Cr.P.C. he was not a proclaimed offender so the bar imposed by the Apex Court entertaining anticipatory bail of the proclaimed offender would not attract in the present case. 28.    Therefore, in view of what has been considered above and also in view of dictum of Apex Court in re: Sushila Aggarwal (supra), I find it appropriate that the liberty of the present applicant be protected till filing of the police report, u/s 173(2) Cr.P.C. and if any charge-sheet is filed, the liberty of the present applicant shall be protected till conclusion of trial. 29.    Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the material available on record, the present anticipatory bail application is allowed. 30.    Therefore, it is directed that in the event of arrest, applicant- Manish Yadav shall be released on anticipatory bail in the aforesaid case crime number on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting authority/ court concerned with the following conditions:- 1. that the applicant shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required; 2. that the applicant shall not, directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with the evidence; 3. that the applicant shall not leave India without the previous permission 4. that in default of any of the conditions mentioned above, the investigating officer shall be at liberty to file appropriate application for cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to the applicant; 5. that in case charge-sheet is submitted the applicant shall not tamper with the evidence during the trial; 6. that the applicant shall not pressurize/ intimidate the prosecution 7. that the applicant shall appear before the trial court on each date fixed unless personal presence is exempted; 8. that in case of breach of any of the above conditions the court below shall have the liberty to cancel the bail.
1. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 13th July, 2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Keonjhar convicting the Appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for life in ST Case No.18 of 2004. 2. By an order dated 19th October 2012, this Court enlarged the Appellant on bail. 3. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. R. N. Parija, learned counsel appointed by the High Court Legal Services JCRLA 96 of 2006                                      Page 1 of 4 Committee to appear for the Appellant and Mr. A. P. Das, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State-Respondent. 4. The case of the prosecution is that the mother of the accused had left the house after quarrelling with his father. The accused was said to have been upset and threatened his father. The deceased, who happened to be the elder cousin brother of the accused, protested this act of the accused. A quarrel ensued between them. However, at that point in time, the dispute subsided and, in the evening, both the accused and the deceased took their meals in the house of the accused. The deceased slept in the verandah. 5. At around 11.30 PM, on hearing the shout of the deceased, the Informant-Nakula Behera (P.W.1), the father of the deceased and the uncle of the accused woke up and saw the accused standing with a Bala and his son, the deceased, lying with head injuries. P.W.1 chased the accused, who ran away throwing the Bala at the spot. 6. P.W.1 lodged the report at the Bamebari Outpost. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Baral (P.W.8) was the Investigating Officer (IO), who on 14th June, 2003 at around 7 AM took down the complaint in writing, registered the case and took up investigation. On 15 th June 2003, he seized the wearing apparels of the deceased and on the same day at 10.30 AM arrested the accused and seized the wearing apparels of the accused. Meanwhile, the dead body of the deceased was sent for Post-Mortem (PM). The charge was laid against the accused for the offence under Section 302 IPC. He pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 7. Eight witnesses were examined for the prosecution and none for the defence. 8. P.W.1, the informant, spoke clearly and cogently about he having witnessed the incident. In his cross-examination, he made clear that a ‘Dibiri’ was burning in the room and he was clearly able to recognize the accused. He also mentioned how his wife and his daughter, Bilasini (P.W.3) also woke up and saw the accused run away. He said “to my knowledge, there was no enmity between the accused and the deceased.” Barring the above sentence, nothing else emerged in the cross-examination of this witness to doubt the veracity of his testimony. 9. It is sought to be argued that the above sentence in the cross- examination shows there was no motive for the crime. However, P.W.3 said that “at evening, the accused being drunk came to our house and there was exchange of words between my brother and accused. Being asked by us, the accused went away to his house.” Clearly therefore, there was a quarrel between the deceased and the accused in the evening whereas the murder took place in the night while the deceased was sleeping. Although P.W.3 said in the cross-examination “there was no quarrel between the accused and deceased prior to this incident”, what she was referring to were incidents prior to the quarrel that took place between the accused and the deceased. The evidence of P.W.4, who was another uncle of the accused and the deceased, is not very helpful to either side although he says accused and the deceased were in good terms. The seizure witnesses have also supported the case of the JCRLA 96 of 2006                                        Page 3 of 4 prosecution. Blood stains were detected on the Bala but the blood grouping and the origine could not be detected. 10. This is not a case of mistaken identity since all the witnesses are close relations of both the accused and the deceased. The fact that the accused hits the deceased with Bala on the head clearly reveals his intention to cause the death of the deceased. This was not on the spur of the moment. The quarrel happened in the evening whereas the incident happened in the night when the deceased was sleeping and wholly unarmed. There was no need for the close relations of the accused to falsely implicate him in the homicidal death of the deceased. 11. The evidence being clear and cogent, the Court finds no reason to interfere with the well-reasoned judgment of the trial Court. There is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed as such. 12. The bail bond of the Appellant is cancelled and he is directed to surrender forthwith and in any event, not later than 1 st June, 2022 failing which the IIC concerned Police Station will take steps to have him apprehended in order to serve out the remainder of the sentence.

Considered the submission of learned counsel for the parties. On the point of compromise between the parties in criminal cases following case law will be relevant: (i) Gian Singh vs.State of Punjab and another (2012) 10 (ii) Narinder Singh and others Vs.State of Punjab and other (2014) 6 Supreme court cases 466 (iii) State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Laxmi Narayan and others (2019) 5 Supreme court cases 688. In the case of Gian Singh (Supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in para No.61 and 62 as follows: "61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarized thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between thee a victim and the offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like b the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding. 62. In view of the above, it cannot be said that B.S. Joshi ,Nikhil Merchants and Manoj Sharma were not correctly decided. We answer the reference accordingly. Let these matters be now listed before the Bench(es) Concerned." In the Case of Narinder Singh (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows in para No.29: 29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay down the following principles by which the High Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment to the settlement between the parties and exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code while accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to accept the settlement with direction to continue with the criminal proceedings: 29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter between themselves. However, this power is to be exercised sparingly and with caution. 29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on that basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in a such cases would be to secure: (i) ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. While exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives. 29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for the offences alleged to have been committed under special statute like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender. 29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly       and    predominantly      civil  character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves. 29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as to whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal cases. 29.6. Offences under Section 307 IPC would fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be generally treated as crime against the society and not against the individual alone. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to proving the charge under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delicate parts of the body, nature of weapons used, etc. Medical report in respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of conviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the former case it can refuse to accept the Settlement and quash the criminal proceedings whereas in the latter case it would be permissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding the offence based on complete settlement between the parties. At this stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the settlement between the parties is going to result in harmony between them which may improve their future relationship. 29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is because of the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on and even the charge-sheet has not been filed. Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court can show benevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the other hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at the stage of argument, normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court would be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to come to a conclusion as to whether the offence under Section 307 IPC is committed or not a Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromise between the parties would not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the offender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is proved under Section 307 IPC and conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime." In the case of State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.Laxmi Narayan (Supra) held as follows in para No. 15.1 to 15.4: "15.1 That the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to quash the criminal proceedings for the non- compoundable offences under Section 320 of the Code can be exercised having overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the parties have resolved the entire dispute amongst 15.2. Such power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involved heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society; 15.3 Similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences under the special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender; 15.4 Offences under Section 307 IPC and the Arms Act etc. rwould fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be treated as crime against the society and not against the individual alone, and therefore, the criminal proceedings for the offence under Section 307 IPC and/or the Arms Act etc. which have a serious impact on the society cannot be quashed in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code, on the ground that the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themselves. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to framing the charge under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. However, such an exercise by the High Court would be permissible only after the evidence is collected after investigation and the charge sheet is filed/charge is framed and/or during the trial. Such exercise is not permissible when the matter is still under investigation. Therefore, the ultimate conclusion in paragraphs 29.6 and 29.7 of the decision of this Court in the case of Narinder Singh (supra) should be read harmoniously and to be read as a whole and in the circumstances stated hereinabove" Learned Counsel for both the parties are present before this Court and submitted that the charge sheet including the proceedings of the case be quashed on the basis of compromise entered into the parties. The learned A.G.A. has no objection as parties to the dispute relating to matrimonial mater have entered into compromise. Considering the facts of the present case as well as the principle of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court as mentioned above, matrimonial dispute between the husband and wife should be a quashed when the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themself through compromise duly filed and verified by the Court. There is another aspect of the case that F.I.R. has been lodged under Sections 498-A, 323 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, which will come under category specified in para No.29.4 laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in Narinder Singh (supra) and in category specified in para No.15.1 laid down by Apex Court in State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Laxmi Narayan and others (supra) regading which proceedings relating to matrimonial dispute can be quashed in exercise of power under In view of the discussion made above, it would be unnecessary to drag these proceeding, as continuation of the criminal proceeding despite settlement and compromise would amount to abuse of process of law accordingly, the instant application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is allowed on the basis of compromise dated 16.03.2022 as verified on 30.03.2022. The proceeding of cognizance order dated 02.08.2021 and charge sheet No.1 dated 07.04.2021 filed in Case No.9956 of 2021 arising out of Case Crime No.0018 of 2021, under Sections 498-A, 323 of IPC and 3/4 of D.P. Act, Police Station-Mahila Thana, District-Kannauj including the entire proceedings of the case are hereby quashed. No order as to costs. Digitally signed by PRITI SHARMA   Order Date :- 2.6.2022/PS
2.      Assailing the order dated 22.7.2021 passed in Criminal RC(MD) No. 379 of 2021 and Crl. MP (MD) No. 3829 of 2021 by the Madras High Court, Madurai Bench, confirming the order dated 13.5.2021 of the respondent No. 1 in MC No. 95 of 2021 (A3), the present appeal has been filed by the appellant. 3.        The facts in brief are, the respondent No. 1 and the High Court found the appellant guilty for breach of the conditions of bond and punished him in exercise of power under Section 122(1)(b) of   the Code of Criminal Procedure (in short “Cr.P.C.”). The orders impugned indicate that the appellant was indulged in criminal activities, however, the respondent No. 1 after  notice  and   affording   opportunity,  passed   order  on 24.2.2021 under Section 117 read with Section 110(e) Cr.P.C.. In compliance, the appellant executed a bond to maintain good behaviour and peace for a period of one year and also undertook to pay Rs. 50,000/­ as penalty to the Government in case of breach or else face the proceedings under Section 122(1)(b) Cr.P.C. Even on execution of bond, he was found involved in an offence of commission of murder, registered by Uchipuli Police Station   as   Crime    No.   149    of  2021    under   Sections 147/148/342/302 read with 109/120(B) IPC. The respondent No. 1 vide order dated 13.5.2021 found him guilty for breach of bond however, ordered his arrest and sent him to the custody. The said order has been affirmed by the High Court, however, this appeal has been filed challenging both the orders. 4.      Shri A. Velan, learned counsel appearing          for the appellant has strenuously urged that the orders passed by the administrative authorities usually do not follow the procedure prescribed and afford reasonable opportunity. The High Court of Delhi in the case of Aldanish vs. State of NCT of Delhi 2018 SCC online Del 12207 issued the guidelines to impart training to these officers. Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of Madras High Court in the case of Devi vs. Executive Magistrate (Mad HC) 2020 SCC online Mad 2706, wherein the High Court taking a different view from the previous judgment directed to place the matter before Hon’ble the Chief Justice for constituting the Division Bench to hear the similar issue. Learned counsel has also placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in Prem Chand vs. Union of India (1981) 1 SCC 639 specifying the manner, in which the police personnel must act upon, but the personal liberty cannot be put into peril on their mercy. Further, placing reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of Gopalanachari vs. State of Kerala 1980 (Supp) SCC 649, learned counsel emphasized the importance of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and its significance. In view of the said submissions,     imposition of conditions in the bond without due enquiry and affording reasonable opportunity is wholly unjustified, and appellant cannot be held guilty and may be sent to the custody unceremoniously. 5.      On the other hand, Dr. Joseph Aristotle S., learned counsel representing the respondents contends that eight criminal cases were pending against the appellant, therefore bond of good behaviour was taken in exercise of the power under Section 117 Cr.P.C. asking security.    On violation of the said bond, by virtue of the powers conferred under Section 122(1)(b) Cr.P.C., the order impugned has rightly been passed.        It is urged that Chapter VIII of Cr.P.C. confer powers to the Executive Magistrate for taking bond to keep the peace and security for good behaviour from the suspected persons. Appellant gave the undertaking on breach of conditions of bond due to which he may be dealt with as per Section 122(1)(b) Cr.P.C. Later, appellant was found involved in an offence of commission of murder, however a show cause notice was issued fixing date for appearance on      7.5.2021. In the reply filed by appellant, execution of the bond has not been disputed and making him accused in a murder case has also not been denied, except to controvert that without proving guilt, he may not be responsible for the said act. The competent authority affording opportunity to the appellant, has rightly passed the order on 13.5.2021 on establishing violation of the terms of the     bond executed on 24.2.2021 by the appellant.         It is urged procedure as contemplated has been followed by the respondents, however, interference was not called by the High Court, to which interference under Article 136 of Constitution is not warranted. 6.      After hearing learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of record, it appears that from 2012 to January, 2021, eight criminal cases were registered against the appellant, including of simple and grievous hurt, theft and also under the Arms Act. After the report received from the respondent No. 2, a show cause notice was issued to the appellant and enquiry was conducted by respondent No. 1. In furtherance thereto, his statement was recorded and the response had also been taken. The respondent No. 1 recorded the satisfaction that the appellant might cause breach of peace in the locality, however directed him to furnish a bond to the sum of Rs. 50,000 without surety    for a period of one year under Section 117 Cr.P.C., failing which he may serve the imprisonment under Section 122(1)(a) Cr. P.C. or in case of breach of conditions, recourse of Section 122(1)(b)   Cr.P.C. may be taken. The contents of the bond executed by the appellant are relevant hence reproduced This case was initiated in the court of 2nd Class Magistrate and Tahsildar, Ramanathapuram on the basis of case registered in Uchipuli Police Station. This person was produced before this Court on 24.2.2021. Enquiry was conducted in the court and the provisions mentioned in show cause notice issued was explained to MARAVETTIVALASAI,         in    detail  statement    and arguments of the parties were taken. Considering all these facts and the information received from inquiry, this Court has arrived at the conclusion at the person Name Devadhasan 28/21, s/o DEIVENTHIRAN is likely to create Breach of Peace in the locality and therefore shall be bound u/s 117 Cr.P.C. by using a bond for Rs. 50,000/­ without sureties, for a period of one year from. Thus, this Court of Second Class Ex. Magistrate and Tahsildar, Ramanathapuram hereby ordered to execute a Bond for Rs. 50000/­ without sureties, for a period of 1 year from 24.2.2021 failing which he shall serve imprisonment for the above mentioned u/s 122(1) (a) in case of breach conditions during the period of bond the individual state be imprisonment for the remaining period u/s 122 (1)(b). 7.      After execution of bond, on 31.3.2021 Crime No. 141 of 2021 was registered joining the appellant as co­accused for the offences under Sections 147/148/342/302 r/w 109/120(B) IPC at P.S. Uchipuli, Ramanathapuram and breached the terms and conditions of the bond. A show cause notice was issued asking the response and also sought appearance of appellant before the respondent No. 1 on 7.5.2021. He submitted his explanation and his statement was recorded. The respondent No. 1 affording opportunity      passed the order on 13.5.2021 holding the appellant guilty for violation of the terms and conditions of the bond     and     punished under Section 122(1)(b) Cr.P.C. In pursuance of the order, he is arrested and sent to prison. It is to observe that Chapter VIII of Cr.P.C. confer powers to the Executive Magistrate to take bond for maintaining security and for keeping the peace and good behaviour by the citizens. As per Section 107 Cr.P.C,      on receiving the information, that any person is likely to commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquility or to do any wrongful act, the Executive Magistrate may have power to show cause on violation of the terms of the bond so executed for maintaining peace. As per Section 108 of Cr.P.C., similar power has been given for maintaining the security   for  good   behaviour    from  persons   disseminating seditious matters. Similarly, to take security for good behaviour from suspected persons and habitual offenders, powers under Sections 109 and 110 Cr.P.C.      have been conferred upon the Executive Magistrate. In the present case, the order was passed under Sections 111 and 117 Cr.P.C. for security. On violation, recourse, specified under Section 122 Cr.P.C. is permissible. Therefore, the Legislature introduced the said Chapter conferring powers on the authorities to take action for violation of peace and tranquility in public order by the citizens of the locality, otherwise, by following the procedure as prescribed, the action may be taken by the competent authority. 8.      Learned counsel for the appellant has       heavily relied upon the directions issued by the Delhi High Court as well as Madras High Court in the cases of Aldanish & Devi (supra) emphasizing in general that the administrative officers do not follow the procedure, so prescribed and also relied upon the judgment    of  Gopalanachari      (supra)   emphasizing       the importance of Article 21 of the Constitution of India affecting personal liberty of the citizens. But, in the facts of the case at hand, nothing has been brought on record that how and in what manner the procedure contemplated under Chapter VIII of Cr.P.C. has not been followed. It is a trite law that by following the procedure established by law, the personal liberty of the citizens can be dealt with. Looking to the facts of this case, the bond executed     by the appellant on 24.2.2021 under      Section 110 read with Section 117 Cr.P.C. has been violated by him on account of his involvement in a criminal case, registered subsequently.     In the present case, the bond executed by the appellant has not been questioned.       In fact, the subsequent action of passing the order dated 13.5.2021 sending him to the custody due to violation of the bond as per the mandate of law has been assailed. As per the discussion made hereinabove, in our considered opinion, the order passed by respondent No. 1 is after following the procedure, so prescribed and affording due opportunity to the appellant.       The High Court has rightly affirmed the said order. In the facts, the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be countenanced. 9.      In view of the discussion made hereinabove, we are of the considered view that the orders passed by the High Court and respondent No. 1 do not call for any interference. Therefore, this appeal is bereft of any merit, hence dismissed.
The petitioner is challenging the order dated 23.03.2021 (Annexure A-1) passed in Appeal Case No.48/2021/Registration by the Appellate Authority-cum-Joint Commissioner, Goods and Services Tax, 2.           The brief facts shows that petitioner’s company was registered under the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and was alloted the registration No.23AAICR6172RIZP. However, on account of non-filing of return, the GST number allotted to the petitioner was cancelled. Against cancellation, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the respondent No.4. The said appeal has been dismissed vide order dated 23.03.2021, which is being sought to be impugned in the present petition. 3.           No one appeared even in the second round when the case was 4.            Learned counsel for respondents submits that registration of the petitioner was cancelled on 19.06.2019, against which the petitioner herein preferred an appeal on 30.01.2021 and then the appeal was taken up on 16.03.2021, the Appellate Authority taking into consideration of provisions under Section 107 of GST Act, dismissed the appeal as time barred. 5.            We have heard learned counsel for respondents and perused the records produced by respondents. 6.            Perusal of the records shows that the order of cacellation of registration was passed way back on 19.06.2019 and the appeal was preferred by the petitioner on 30.01.2021. Thus, the appeal was preferred almost after one and half years from the date of order of cancellation of 6.1           Section 107 (1) of GST Act provides that an appeal can be preferred within a period of three (3) months from the date of the order, while Section 107 (4) of the Act stipulates that the Appellate Authority, if satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the period of limitation of 3 months, allow it to be presented within a further period of one month. 6.2.   Thus, the total period during which the appeal ought to have been preferred was four months from the date of cancellation of registration dated 19.06.2019. However, despite lapse of four months, the appeal was not preferred by the appellant/petitioner, nor even in the memo of appeal, sufficient reasons for not filing the appeal in time were disclosed. There was unexplained delay of 1 ½ years in filing the appeal. 7.            Thus, in our considered view, the respondent No.4 has not committed any error while dismissing the appeal preferred by the present petitioner and therefore, we do not find any substance in the present petition. Accordingly, the same stands dismissed.
1. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 21 st March, 2007 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mayurbhanj in ST Case No.175 of 2005 convicting the Appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC for the murder of his cousin, Basanta Kumar Naik and sentencing him to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment (RI) for three months. 2. At the outset it requires to be noted that pursuant to the order dated 21st April, 2022 of this Court, the IIC, Karanjia Police Station, Mayurbhanj has submitted a report on 5 th May, 2022 JCRLA 51 of 2007                                      Page 1 of 8 stating that the Appellant is staying in his house with his wife and his other family members. 3. The case of the prosecution is that on 23/24 th April, 2005 around midnight, the deceased quarreled with his wife, Gouri Naik (P.W.1) and during such quarrel, the accused, who was the cousin of the deceased, came there and challenged the deceased for picking up quarrels with the family members regularly. Due to such challenge, there was a hot exchange of words between the deceased and the accused. Thereafter, the accused returned to his house and returned back with a sword and assaulted the deceased, as a result of which the deceased sustained severe bleeding injuries and died at the spot. 4. A telephonic message was sent to the police. Mr. Somanath Sahu, attached to the Karanjia Police Station (PS) (P.W.10) proceeded to the spot, took down the report of P.W.1, registered it as an FIR and took up the investigation. He then arrested the accused, held an inquest over the dead body, prepared inquest report and sent the body for Post-Mortem (PM). While in custody, the accused offered to produce the sword used to murder the deceased and pursuant thereto, the sword (MO-1) was seized from a straw heap near the house of the deceased. A charge-sheet was filed. The accused denied the charge and claimed trial. 5. Ten witnesses were examined for the prosecution, which included the Investigating Officer (IO)-P.W.10. The eye- JCRLA 51 of 2007                                         Page 2 of 8 witnesses were P.W.1 (the wife of the deceased), Smt. Gaya Naik (P.W.2), the aunt of the accused and the mother of the deceased and the father of the deceased-Hari Naik (P.W.4). 6. The cross-examination of P.W.1 did not yield anything at all for the defence. She stated that it was a moonlit night on the date of the occurrence. She stated that the deceased had taken liquor and that the parents of the deceased were also present when the accused assaulted her husband with the sword. She denied the suggestion that at the time of the incident the deceased was armed with an axe or that he tried to assault the accused with that axe or in the result of a tussle with the accused, the deceased had sustained injuries. 7. As far as P.W.2 is concerned, she too stood firm in her cross- examination. While she said she was not able to see clearly in the night, she still denied that it was not the accused who had murdered the deceased. As far as P.W.3 is concerned, he too was unable to be shaken in the cross-examination. 8. Faced with the above facts, which clearly point to the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, learned counsel for the Appellant sought to build the case of the offence being one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Reliance was placed on the decisions of the Supreme Court in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Wazir Chand (1978) 1 SCC 130, Ravi Kumar v. State of Punjab (2005) 9 SCC 315, Surinder Kumar v. Union JCRLA 51 of 2007                                        Page 3 of 8 Territory, Chandigarh (1989) 2 SCC 217, Pardeshiram v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2021) 3 SCC 238 and Gurmukh Singh v. State of Haryana (2009) 15 SCC 635. 9. Learned counsel for the Appellant relied on the decision in Wazir Chand (supra) to make it appear that it was a sudden fight flowing from an earlier incident. As regards the fact situation in Wazir Chand (supra), it is noticed from the said judgment by this Court that there was only one injury in that case, which was opined to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. This was one of four injuries leading to the inference that the other three were obviously viewed as serious injuries. 10. The present case is not one of a sudden quarrel at all. After the quarrel between the deceased and the accused, the accused returned to his house, and then returned to the house of the deceased with a sword and assaulted the deceased with it. Therefore, this was clearly pre-planned. The intention to commit the murder was apparent from the huge number of injuries on the body of the deceased. The injuries were as under: "(ii) Multiple injuries present with clean cut margin under both the deltoid region, left side of the neck, left thigh, dorsum of right palm, right maxilla and contact abrasion on the chest i.e. (a) cut wound on the left arm deltoid region of size 7" x 3" x 2 ½'' horizontally situated and have felling out medially by contact abrasion 3" length corresponding fracture of humorous present. (b) Similar cut wound present on the right deltoid region of size 7" x 3" x 3'' and felling laterally underlying humorous fracture present. (c) Two definite cut wounds whose margins are adhered together present on the left side of the neck of size 6 ½'' x 3 ½'' x 2'' and partially mandible is cut, Left side major vessels of the neck are cut. (d) cut would present on the dorsum of the right palm 1 ½'' (e) Similar cut wound on the lower part of the left thigh present of size 2 ½" x 1" x ½ c.m. (f) 7" horizontally situated one contact abrasion present on the right side of the chest extending from just above nipple to posterior margin of auxilla, where one stab wound of size 1" x ½" x ½" was present. (g) Similar contact abrasion present obliquely on the mid part of the chest of size 10" length. (h) Similar contact abrasion of size 4" present on the front of neck." 11. All of the injuries were said to be ante-mortem in nature and the cause of death was due to haemorrhagic shock due to homicidal cut injuries by a sharp cutting weapon. In other words, it was not just any one injury that caused the death of the deceased, but all of the above cut injuries. The cross-examination of the doctor (P.W.8) did not bring out anything at all for the defence. He clearly stated that such injuries are not possible “by fall over a sharp-edged stone.” 12. Although the Appellant sought to put forth an alternative theory of the deceased being armed with an axe, he could not produce any evidence to make good such defence. Turning to the next decision in Ravi Kumar (supra), in the said case there was a quarrel between the accused and the deceased on the previous JCRLA 51 of 2007                                           Page 5 of 8 date. On the next day, the accused and the deceased had talks. During the course of talks, a quarrel again ensued and the accused took up a Dhangu and gave two blows on the head of the deceased. The Dhangu was not brought by the accused but it was found behind the deceased, which was picked up by the accused. These facts therefore show that indeed the incident happened on the spur of the moment whereas in the present case, the accused returned with the sword after a quarrel had taken place and, therefore, clearly intended to murder the deceased. 13. In Surinder Kumar (supra), the following facts make it clear that it was in a different set of circumstances that the Supreme Court in the said decision converted the offence to one under "3. On January 3, 1975, at about 7.15 p.m., PW 2 and his deceased brother had an heated argument with the appellant and his brother Amrit Lal in regard to the return of the kitchen. In the course of this heated exchange PW 2 is alleged to have showered filthy abuses. Although PW 2 denies this fact, PW 4 has admitted the same. PW 2 also threatened to throw out the utensils and lock the kitchen. Since PW 2 was uttering filthy abuses in the presence of the appellant's sister and Nitya Nand did not restrain him, the appellant got enraged, went into the kitchen and returned with a knife with which he inflicted one blow on the neck of PW 2 causing a bleeding injury. In the melee the appellant inflicted three knife blows to Nitya Nand; one on the shoulder, the other on the elbow and the third on the chest, as a result whereof Nitya Nand collapsed to the floor and later died while on the way to the hospital." 14. Clearly therefore Nitya Nand, who was the deceased, was not the target, but it was P.W.2, who was the target and Nitya Nand, JCRLA 51 of 2007                                        Page 6 of 8 who intervened, got attacked. The facts here are very different and cannot be brought within Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC. 15. In Pardeshiram (supra), there was a dispute as regards to a agricultural land prior to the incident and at the time of the incident, a quarrel had started on the issue of construction of a wall on the said land. The Appellant had hit the deceased with a shovel, a common agricultural tool, which was available at the spot. These facts clearly revealed that the crime happened at the spur of the moment and quiet unlike the present case where the accused returned with the sword to the house of the deceased and inflicted numerous sword wounds on his person. 16. In the last-mentioned case, Gurmukh Singh(supra), the facts were very different, which read as under: "3. According to the prosecution version, on 8.1.1997 in the morning, deceased Hazoor Singh had borrowed the tractor of Lal Singh and tiller of Gurbachan Singh. Gurmej Singh, P.W.5, son of Hazoor Singh (the deceased) was going along with Lal Singh to return the tractor at the Dera of Gurbachan Singh. On the way, accused Gurmukh Singh, son of Dayal Singh, accompanied by the co-accused Niranjan Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Manjit Singh armed with lathis, whose Dera was nearby came and stopped the tractor. The appellant raised a lalkara that Hazoor Singh and his son should not be allowed to pass through the passage of which there was a dispute between the parties. Hazoor Singh was following the tractor. He advised the appellant to desist from stopping the tractor on which the appellant gave a lathi-blow on the head of the deceased Hazoor Singh rendering him unconscious, resulting in his fall on the ground.” 17. No comparison could be drawn with the above facts and the facts on hand. Consequently, the Court is not persuaded that in the present case the offence should be converted to one punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC. 18. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds no error committed by the trial Court in convicting the Appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. 19. However, it has been brought to the notice of the Court that during the pendency of the appeal, the Government of Odisha in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 remitted the unexpired portion of the sentence passed against the accused and ordered his premature release vide a letter (File No.IV-J-05/2021 6049 dated 21st June, 2021) of the Joint Secretary to Government in the Law Department communicated to the I.G. Prisons and DCS Odisha, Bhubaneswar. Pursuant thereto, the Appellant has already been released. The said letter is kept on record. 20. In view of the above, no further steps need be taken against the Appellant. Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of. JCRLA 51 of 2007                                        Page 8 of 8
Case :- PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION (PIL) No. - 372 of 2022 Counsel for Petitioner :- Subhas Chandra Pandey Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for By means of this writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India ostensibly in Public Interest, a prayer has been made to issue direction to the State Government to enhance the age of superannuation of the employees of the State of U.P. from 60 years to 62 years. It is strange that such a petition has been filed purportedly in public interest. The petitioner is a complete stranger so far as the conditions of service of the employees of the State Government are concerned. It is also noticeable that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in more than one cases has categorically held that in service matters, no public interest litigation will be maintainable. Reference may be had to the judgment in the case of Dr. Duryodhan Sahu and others versus Jitendra Kumar Mishra and others, reported in (1998) 7 SCC 273. In the case of Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware vs. State of Maharashtra and others, reported in (2005) 1 SCC 590, Hon'ble Supreme Court referring to the judgment in the case of Dr. Duryodhan Sahu and others (supra) has observed that despite the said judgment the inflow of so called PILs involving service matters continues unabated in the courts. The relevant observation in this regard has been made by Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 16 of the judgment in the case of Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware (supra), which is extracted herein below: "16. As noted supra, a time has come to weed out the petitions, which though titled as public interest litigations are in essence something else. It is shocking to note that courts are flooded with a large number of so- called public interest litigations where even a minuscule percentage can legitimately be called as public interest litigations. Though the parameters of public interest litigation have been indicated by this Court in a large number of cases, yet unmindful of the real intentions and objectives, courts are entertaining such petitions and wasting valuable judicial time which, as noted above, could be otherwise utilised for disposal of genuine cases. Though in Duryodhan Sahu (Dr.) v. Jitendra SC 114] this Court held that in service matters PILs should not be entertained, the inflow of so-called PILs involving service matters continues unabated in the courts and strangely are entertained. The least the High Courts could do is to throw them out on the basis of the said decision. The other interesting aspect is that in the PILs, official documents are being annexed without even indicating as to how the petitioner came to possess them. In one case, it was noticed that an interesting answer was given as to its possession. It was stated that a packet was lying on the road and when out of curiosity the petitioner opened it, he found copies of the official documents. Apart from the sinister manner, if any, of getting such copies, the real brain or force behind such cases would get exposed to find out the truth and motive behind the petition. Whenever such frivolous pleas, as noted, are taken to explain possession, the court should do well not only to dismiss the petitions but also to impose exemplary costs. It would be desirable for the courts to filter out the frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs as aforestated so that the message goes in the right direction that petitions filed with oblique motive do not have the approval of the When we closely examine the averments made in the writ petition, what we find is that the petitioner is a complete stranger and has in fact sought alteration in the conditions of service of the employees of the State Government, hence we are not inclined to entertain the instant writ petition. In view of the aforesaid, the writ petition is dismissed.
1       The jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution has been invoked for seeking diverse reliefs pertaining to the constitution of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi following the elections which took place on 4 December 2022. These elections were held to elect 250 Councillors. The first petitioner is a prospective candidate for the post of Mayor. Though over two months have elapsed since the date of the election, the election of the Mayor has not be held. 2       Chapter II of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act 1957 1 deals with the establishment of Corporations. Section 35(1) provides that a Corporation shall at its first meeting in each year elect one of its members to be the Chairperson, who is known as the Mayor, and another member to be the Deputy Mayor of the Corporation. Section 3 provides for the establishment of the Municipal Corporation. Sub-section (3) of Section 3 indicates the composition of the Corporation. In terms of the provision, a Corporation is to be composed of Councillors. Besides the Councillors who are directly elected through the voters in the ward constituencies, there are Councillors who are nominated by the Administrator. Yet others are represented as ex officio representatives. Clause (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 3 specifies the persons who shall be represented in a Corporation. Among them are: “(i) ten persons, who are not less than 25 years of age and who have special knowledge or experience in municipal administration, to be nominated by the The proviso to Section 3(3)(b)(i), however, lays down that “the persons nominated under this sub-clause shall not have the right to vote in the meetings of a Corporation”. 3      Chapter V of the Act deals with procedure and the transaction of business by a Corporation. Section 72(1) provides that a Corporation shall ordinarily hold at least one meeting in every month for the transaction of business. Section 73 provides that the first meeting of a Corporation after a general election shall be held as early as possible after the publication of the results of the election under Section 14 and shall be convened by the Administrator. Section 74 provides for the notice of meetings and transaction of business. Section 76(1) stipulates that a Mayor, or in his absence, the Deputy Mayor shall preside over every meeting of the Corporation. Section 77 makes provision for the Presiding Officer at a meeting for the election of Mayor. Clause (a) of Section 77 provides that at a meeting for the election of a Mayor, the Administrator shall nominate a Councillor who is not a candidate for such an election to preside over the meeting. Section 78 provides for the method of deciding common questions. Section 82 empowers the Corporation to make regulations for the transaction of business at its meetings. 4      Though the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked for seeking several reliefs, the point of controversy has narrowed down to two issues. The first issue is whether aldermen, as they are popularly described, who are nominated by the Administrator under Section 3(3)(b)(i) have the right to vote at the first meeting of the Corporation where the Mayor would be elected. The second issue pertains to the order for holding elections, more specifically, whether, as the petitioners assert, the election to the office of the Mayor shall be held first followed by the elections to the Deputy Mayor and other members of the Standing Committee, on which meetings the Mayor would preside. The opposing view point is that all elections would be held 5      We have heard Dr A M Singhvi, senior counsel, with Mr Shadan Farasat, in support of the petition. Mr Sanjay Jain, Additional Solicitor General, has appeared on behalf of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General, appears on behalf of the Lt Governor. Mr Ranjit Kumar, senior counsel, appears on behalf of the contesting candidate for the post of Mayor. Mr Maninder Singh, senior counsel, has appeared on behalf of the second respondent. 6      Article 243R of the Constitution is embodied in Part IXA of the Constitution which deals with Municipalities. In its material terms, Article 243R provides as follows: “243R. Composition of Municipalities (1)       Save as provided in clause (2), all the seats in a Municipality shall be filled by persons chosen by direct election from the territorial constituencies in the Municipal area and for this purpose each Municipal area shall be divided into territorial constituencies to be known as (i)       persons having special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration; (ii)      the members of the House of the People and the members of the Legislative Assembly of the State representing constituencies which comprise wholly or partly the Municipal area; (iii)     the members of the Council of States and the members of the Legislative Council of the State registered electors within tile Municipal area; (iv)      the Chairpersons of the Committees constituted under clause (5) of article 243S: Provided that the persons referred to in paragraph (i) shall not have the right to vote in the meetings of the Municipality; (b)       the manner of election of the Chairperson of a Municipality.” 7         Clause (1) of Article 243R stipulates that all seats in the Municipality shall be filled in by direct election held from the territorial constituencies in the Municipal area, for which the Municipal area is divided into wards. An exception, however, is stipulated in clause (2), in terms of which the legislature of a State may, by law, provide for the representation in a Municipality of persons fulfilling the descriptions set out in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). Article 243R(2)(a)(i) provides that the legislature of a State may, by law, provide for the representation in a Municipality of persons having special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration. However, the proviso to clause (2) clearly specifies that the persons who are referred to in paragraph (i) shall not have the right to vote in the meetings of the Municipality. The legislature of the State may also provide for the manner of election of the Chairperson of the Municipality. 8         Section 3(3) of the Act is a law as contemplated by Article 243R. In terms of clause (2) of Article 243R, Section 3(3)(b) provides for the representation in the Municipality of persons who have special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration. These persons are nominated by the Administrator. However, in terms of the proviso to Article 243R(2), a similar restriction is introduced in the proviso to Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Act, by which the nominated members do not have a right to vote in the meetings of the Municipal Corporation. 9         The submission which has been urged on behalf of the petitioners by Dr A M Singhvi is that the nominated members of the Corporation do not have the right to vote, including at the election of the Mayor. 10        On the other hand, It has been urged both by the Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Lt Governor and by Mr Sanjay Jain, Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Municipal Corporation, that the restriction on the right to vote in terms of Article 243R(2) as well as the proviso to Section 3(3)(b) ( i) applies only to the regular meetings of the Corporation where the business of the Municipal Corporation is transacted and would not extend to the first meeting after the elections are held. Buttressing the submission, it has been urged that Section 73 requires the first meeting of the Corporation to be convened by the Administrator and Section 35 stipulates that at its first meeting the Corporation shall elect one of its members as a Mayor and another to be a Deputy Mayor. Hence, it has been submitted that the prohibition on the exercise of the right to vote which attaches to the nominated members does not extend to the first meeting of the Corporation. Mr Ranjit Kumar, senior counsel, alluded to the provisions of clause (b) of Article 243R(2), according to which the state legislature may by the legislation provide for the manner of electing the Chairperson of a Municipality. 11     We are unable to accept the submission which has been urged on behalf of the Municipal Corporation and the Lt Governor and by counsel supporting them. The source of the statutory provision is contained in Article 243R of the Constitution itself. Part IXA of the Constitution was introduced by the Constitution (Seventyfourth Amendment) Act 1992. Article 243R provides for the composition of Municipalities. As already noted, the Constitution provides for direct election to all the seats in Municipality, save as specified in clause (2) which enunciates the exceptions. Clause (2) contains provisions, inter alia, for the representation in a Municipality of persons having special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration as well as other persons such as members of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly and members of the Council of States and the Legislative Council of the States representing the specific constituency and the Chairpersons of the Committees constituted under clause (5) of Article 243S. The Constitution has imposed a restriction in terms of which nominated members who are brought in on account of their special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration do not have the right to vote. The same restriction finds statutory recognition in Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Act. The above provisions indicate that persons who are nominated under the sub-clause shall not have the right to vote in the meetings of the Corporation. The Constitution and the Act place value on their experience but the right to vote is not granted to them at meetings of the Corporation. The meetings of the Corporation would include all meetings, including the first meeting which is held after the holding of the general election. Section 73 of the Act provides for the first meeting to be convened by the Administrator as early as possible after the publication of the results, while Section 35 provides for the election of the Mayor and Deputy Mayor at the first meeting of the Corporation. The prohibition on nominated members exercising the right to vote in terms of Section 3(3)(b)(i) shall, therefore, also apply to the first meeting of the Corporation at which the Mayor and, thereafter, the Deputy Mayor are to be elected. 12     Apart from the above issue, it needs to be emphasized that Regulation 7 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Procedure and Conduct of Business) Regulations 1958 stipulates that as soon as the Mayor is elected, “he shall preside over the meeting for the transaction of the rest of the business thereof”. Regulation 8 provides for the election of the Deputy Mayor and stipulates that the provisions of Regulation 6 shall apply, as far as may be, to the election of the Deputy Mayor, subject to the modification that any reference to the presiding authority shall be construed as a reference to the Mayor. These provisions make it abundantly clear that the election of the Mayor has to be held first. The elected Mayor is then required to preside over the election of the Deputy Mayor as the presiding authority. Consequently, with this clarification, it must be noted that the election of the Mayor shall be conducted first in the first meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Once the Mayor is elected, the elected Mayor shall be the presiding authority for the purpose of the election of the Deputy Mayor. 13      The interpretation which we have placed on the provisions of the statute is in accord with the judgment of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Ramesh Mehta v 14      We may also note, at this stage, that on 2 February 2023, the Urban Development Department of the Government of NCT of Delhi has issued a notification clarifying that the election of the Mayor, as required by Section 35 of the Act, shall first be held and the Mayor so elected will then assume the Chair and proceed to conduct the election of the Deputy Mayor and six members of the Standing Committee. The aforesaid notification was issued in the context of a meeting which was to be held on 6 February 2023, which could not be held on that day due to intervening 15      Mr Sanjay Jain has indicated that the same process would be followed at the ensuing meeting for the election of the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor and the members of (i)     At the first meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the election shall be held first for the post of Mayor and at that election, the members who are nominated in terms of Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Act shall not have the right to vote; (ii)    Upon the election of the Mayor, the Mayor shall act as the presiding authority for conducting the election of the Deputy Mayor and the members of the Standing Committee at which also the prohibition on the exercise of vote by the nominated members in terms of Section 3(3)(b)(i) shall continue to operate; and (iii)   The notice convening the first meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi shall be issued within a period of twenty four hours. The notice shall fix the date for convening the first meeting at which the election of the Mayor, Deputy Mayor and members of the Standing Committee shall be conducted in terms of the above
Digitally signed by (BY SRI. PAVANA CHANDRA SHETTY H., ADVOCATE) WP No. 14860 of 2022 The petitioner has called in question validity of the order of transfer at Annexure - A dated 23.12.2021. The facts made out in the petition is that respondent No.6 has been posted to the place of the petitioner as per the impugned order at Annexure-A dated 23.12.2021. Insofar as the posting of the petitioner is concerned, it is only observed that the petitioner is to report to the competent authority for obtaining an order for posting. It is further noticed that it is only on 20.07.2022, more than about six [6] months after the order at Annexure - A, during the pendency of the present proceedings, the petitioner has WP No. 14860 of 2022 been given an order of posting at the Town Municipal Counsel, Ullal (for vacant post). 2.     The only point that requires to be considered is as to whether the order of transfer after the period of general transfers could be upheld where no order of posting has been shown as regards the petitioner. The legal position insofar as not showing order of posting of an employee in whose place another employee has been placed, has been considered in detail by the Division Bench      of    this   Court      in   M.Arun     Prasad    Vs.   The Commissioner of Excise and Others1. The observations at Paragraph Nos.4 to 7 are reproduced below: "4.   We   may record        that this  Court in the above    referred      order       dated    16.09.2016    at paragraph-6 had observed thus: 6.   There are two serious infirmities in the transfer order. One is that when the petitioner is transferred from the post of Assistant Conservator of Forest, there is no clear posting order at a particular post of the petitioner. W.P.No.58931/2016 (S-KAT) dated 02.03.2017 WP No. 14860 of 2022 Unless the petitioner is lifted from one place and posted at another place, it cannot be said that any vacancy has arisen of the petitioner and such an exercise of the power cannot be appreciated even if one keeps in mind the administrative circumstances for the public interest as the case may be.                It is hardly required to be stated that when ‘A’ is posted in place of ‘B’ from one place to another then only there will be a vacancy of ‘A’ and ‘B’ can be posted at the place of ‘A’. If ‘A’ is lifted and his posting is kept in lurch and ‘B’ is posted vice-A such practice cannot be appreciated and deserves to be rather deprecated and the reason being that the officer who is lifted from one place is not certain at which place he has to join the duty and unless he joins the duty at different place, it cannot be said that vacancy in law had arisen at his original place. So long as there is no vacancy at the original place, the question of posting is without any foundation. Hence, the said transfer order can be said to be with the exercise of legal malafide. 5. Thereafter this Court while allowing the petition had also observed at paragraph-12 in the said decision which reads as under: “12. Before parting with, we would find it appropriate to observe that in number of cases it is found by this Court that the transfer order is passed in a manner that one Officer is lifted from one post but it is not clarified about his next posting and he is expected to approach before        the   concerned Department         for appropriate posting and another Officer vice him is already posted. This practice would keep the Officer in lurch about his next posting even he is to be transferred.      Such practice is deprecated by the Court in this matter as well as in other WP No. 14860 of 2022 matters. A reference may be made to the order passed by this Court in W.P.No.39438/2016 disposed        of on     19.08.2016     and W.P.No.43919/2016 disposed of on 23.08.2016. Hence, in order to ensure that appropriate mechanism is worked out, the registry shall forward the copy of the order to the Chief Secretary of the State Government to look into the matter and to take suitable action.” 6. Pending the present petition, the posting order of the petitioner was already made.           However, the fact remained      that  without     appropriate  posting   of  the petitioner, the transfer order was passed coupled with the aspects that as per the observations made by this Court in the earlier order, no transfer order could have been passed without appropriate posting of the Officer who is lifted from the place he is working." 3.     It is clear that the position of law is settled that passing an order of transfer without showing place of posting would suffer from legal malafide. This position is reiterated by the Division Bench of this Court in the latest decision in Mahiboob Sab Vs. The State of Karnataka and Others2. It is also to be noticed that this is the stand of the Government as is noticed from the Circulars W.P.No.16363/2021 (S-KSAT) dated 31.05.2022 WP No. 14860 of 2022 of 18.01.2017 and 27.03.2017. In fact, the Circular of 27.03.2017      further   stipulates  that  reasons   must be recorded in writing for not showing posting to any Government       Servant     and   such   reasons   should be "compelling administrative reasons like non availability of post    due   to   abolishment/up-gradation/down-gradation, shifting in lieu of suspension, requirement of Government Servant to perform urgent confidential work in a post, unsuitability or inefficiency to work in the existing vacancy or for being utilized against temporary and leave vacancy etc., which are only illustrative but not exhaustive". Procedure is also shown to review orders of transfer by the Head of the Department where person displaced is not shown posting recording reasons in writing. 4.   Admittedly, in the present case, none of the procedures are followed. Despite the observations by the Division Bench of this Court in M.Arun Prasad's case WP No. 14860 of 2022 (supra) and also the Government Circulars referred to above, time and again orders of transfer are being passed without showing places for posting. In terms of the order in M.Arun Prasad's case (supra), vacancy will not arise until an employee in whose place another employee has been transferred, is shown a place of posting. The Government to ensure that such instances should not repeat and strict compliance of Circular dated 27.03.2017 as well as directions of the Division Bench of this Court in M.Arun Prasad's case (supra). 5.   It is also necessary to note that transfer is made in the month of December. Even as per the records submitted by the Government, as per note on 01.10.2021 it is observed that if transfers are made after the period of general transfers, no request for transfers should be entertained or orders made unless there is a vacant place. In the present case, as stated earlier, there was no vacant WP No. 14860 of 2022 place    while  considering    the   representation  of   the respondent No.6 to be transferred and posted in the place of the petitioner. It is also noticed that the case of respondent No.6 is on the basis of the letter of the Member     of  the   Legislative    Assembly.   Nevertheless, procedure requires to be followed. 6.    The delay in filing is explained by way of earlier proceedings instituted by the petitioner before this Court in W.P.No.3955/2022 (S-RES) disposed of on 22.02.2022 and subsequently, in Application.No.1439/2022 disposed of on 12.07.2022. 7.    Accordingly, on two grounds i.e., not showing an order of posting for a period of more than six [6] months and on the ground that no transfer must be made except to a vacant post after the period of general transfers, while noticing that the transfer is made in December 2021 as noticed in the proceedings of transfer, WP No. 14860 of 2022 the   petition  is  allowed.    The impugned     order  dated 23.12.2021 at Annexure - A is set aside. The parties are directed to be placed in the position prior to the impugned It is only expected that the State will ensure strict compliance with its own Circular of 27.03.2017 as well as directions   of  the   Division  Bench    passed  in  M.Arun Prasad's case (supra) and the observations in Mahiboob Sab's case (supra).
1. This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 13th July, 2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Keonjhar convicting the Appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for life in ST Case No.18 of 2004. 2. By an order dated 19th October 2012, this Court enlarged the Appellant on bail. 3. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. R. N. Parija, learned counsel appointed by the High Court Legal Services JCRLA 96 of 2006                                      Page 1 of 4 Committee to appear for the Appellant and Mr. A. P. Das, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State-Respondent. 4. The case of the prosecution is that the mother of the accused had left the house after quarrelling with his father. The accused was said to have been upset and threatened his father. The deceased, who happened to be the elder cousin brother of the accused, protested this act of the accused. A quarrel ensued between them. However, at that point in time, the dispute subsided and, in the evening, both the accused and the deceased took their meals in the house of the accused. The deceased slept in the verandah. 5. At around 11.30 PM, on hearing the shout of the deceased, the Informant-Nakula Behera (P.W.1), the father of the deceased and the uncle of the accused woke up and saw the accused standing with a Bala and his son, the deceased, lying with head injuries. P.W.1 chased the accused, who ran away throwing the Bala at the spot. 6. P.W.1 lodged the report at the Bamebari Outpost. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Baral (P.W.8) was the Investigating Officer (IO), who on 14th June, 2003 at around 7 AM took down the complaint in writing, registered the case and took up investigation. On 15 th June 2003, he seized the wearing apparels of the deceased and on the same day at 10.30 AM arrested the accused and seized the wearing apparels of the accused. Meanwhile, the dead body of the deceased was sent for Post-Mortem (PM). The charge was laid against the accused for the offence under Section 302 IPC. He pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 7. Eight witnesses were examined for the prosecution and none for the defence. 8. P.W.1, the informant, spoke clearly and cogently about he having witnessed the incident. In his cross-examination, he made clear that a ‘Dibiri’ was burning in the room and he was clearly able to recognize the accused. He also mentioned how his wife and his daughter, Bilasini (P.W.3) also woke up and saw the accused run away. He said “to my knowledge, there was no enmity between the accused and the deceased.” Barring the above sentence, nothing else emerged in the cross-examination of this witness to doubt the veracity of his testimony. 9. It is sought to be argued that the above sentence in the cross- examination shows there was no motive for the crime. However, P.W.3 said that “at evening, the accused being drunk came to our house and there was exchange of words between my brother and accused. Being asked by us, the accused went away to his house.” Clearly therefore, there was a quarrel between the deceased and the accused in the evening whereas the murder took place in the night while the deceased was sleeping. Although P.W.3 said in the cross-examination “there was no quarrel between the accused and deceased prior to this incident”, what she was referring to were incidents prior to the quarrel that took place between the accused and the deceased. The evidence of P.W.4, who was another uncle of the accused and the deceased, is not very helpful to either side although he says accused and the deceased were in good terms. The seizure witnesses have also supported the case of the JCRLA 96 of 2006                                        Page 3 of 4 prosecution. Blood stains were detected on the Bala but the blood grouping and the origine could not be detected. 10. This is not a case of mistaken identity since all the witnesses are close relations of both the accused and the deceased. The fact that the accused hits the deceased with Bala on the head clearly reveals his intention to cause the death of the deceased. This was not on the spur of the moment. The quarrel happened in the evening whereas the incident happened in the night when the deceased was sleeping and wholly unarmed. There was no need for the close relations of the accused to falsely implicate him in the homicidal death of the deceased. 11. The evidence being clear and cogent, the Court finds no reason to interfere with the well-reasoned judgment of the trial Court. There is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed as such. 12. The bail bond of the Appellant is cancelled and he is directed to surrender forthwith and in any event, not later than 1 st June, 2022 failing which the IIC concerned Police Station will take steps to have him apprehended in order to serve out the remainder of the sentence.

Prayer in W.P.No.19344 of 2013:              Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,      praying for the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari, calling for the records of the communication of the 1st respondent dated 2.6.2012 in letter No.52/S2/2007 and quash the same. The facts in all these Writ Petitions are common and the issues involved are also common and hence, this Court is taking up all the Writ Petitions together and passing this 2.The petitioner is the proprietor of M/s. Meena Advertisers which is an advertising concern. The South Asian Federation Games (hereinafter referred to as ‘SAF games’) were held at Chennai during December 1995. The Government of Tamil Nadu made elaborate arrangements to conduct the event in a grand manner. The Government thought it fit to utilise these games and make a viable economic proposition by commercialisation of the events and to involve private players. In the said process, M/s.Times TV was appointed as the marketing agency and they were expected to obtain sponsorship for television, instadia publicity, sole status appointment such as mineral water supplies, official caterer etc. They were expected to pay 30% of the gross revenue generated through commercialisation and for all direct revenue sources through SAF games organisers. M/s. Times TV was permitted to retain 5% commission. 3.A letter of appointment was issued to M/s. Times TV on 2.11.1995. It seems that M/s. Times TV were not able to get any concrete financial commitment and therefore, it was decided to call for quotations from leading marketing agents in Madras city and appoint marketing agent to carry on with the decision taken by the Government. 4.The petitioner participated in the tender process and submitted the highest bid amount. Thereafter, the petitioner was called for negotiations and was asked to improve the offer and ultimately the petitioner guaranteed a sum of Rs.3 Crores for commercialisation of the games subject to certain rights given to the petitioner. This resulted in the passing of G.O.(D) No. 177, dated 9.12.1995. The Government Order recorded the guarantee given by the petitioner and the exclusive rights given to the petitioner were provided at paragraph 9 of the G.O. and paragraph 10 of the G.O. contemplated signing of a Memorandum of Understanding and the conditions were also specifically stipulated therein. The G.O. also directed the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.3.50 Lakhs to M/s. Times TV as a reimbursement for the publicity measures already undertaken by them. 5.A Memorandum of Understanding was entered into on 9.12.1995 and it specifically provided the terms and conditions and the rights given to the petitioner. 6.After the completion of the SAF games, the petitioner made a representation on 3.2.1996 to the Chairman and Managing Director of TAMIN and requested for remitting a sum of Rs.1 Crore instead of Rs.3 Crores and to waive the balance of Rs.2 Crores. The petitioner gave various reasons for making this request. According to the petitioner, he incurred a loss of Rs.26.75 Lakhs and that he had spent a sum of Rs.2.25 Crores towards advertisement charges and requested the Government to release the payment. 7.The Government issued G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 and waived the sum of Rs.2 Crores that was guaranteed by the petitioner subject to the condition that the petitioner must pay the sum of Rs.3.50 Lakhs to M/s. Times TV and must withdraw the suit filed by him for recovery of money. Accordingly, the petitioner paid the amount to M/s. times TV and also withdrew C.S.No.95 of 1996 that was pending before this Court. 8.An FIR came to be registered by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Department on 27.8.1996. The petitioner was also added as A6 in this FIR. The complaint that led to the registration of the FIR was that a favourable treatment was given to the petitioner inspite of the Model Code of Conduct which was in force in view of the Assembly elections and inspite of the serious objections raised by the Finance Department which resulted in the State exchequer incurring a wrongful loss of a sum of Rs.2 Crores. The FIR was registered as against six accused persons for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC. 9.The petitioner started knocking the doors of the State Government and called upon the Government to pay the expenses incurred by the petitioner towards advertisement charges. The Government replied to the petitioner stating that the criminal case is pending and it will not be possible to settle the claims made by the petitioner. 10.The petitioner was also blacklisted by the Government of Tamil Nadu through a G.O. dated 3.4.1997. It is stated that W.P.No.5257 of 1997, was filed against this Order and the Writ Petition was allowed by an Order dated 5.10.2002. 11.A communication dated 20.6.2000 was sent to the petitioner calling upon the petitioner to show cause as to why G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 should not be cancelled. The petitioner challenged the same by filing W.P.No.11616 of 2000 and this Writ Petition was dismissed by an Order dated 12.7.2000 and the petitioner was directed to submit his reply for the show cause notice. 12.There was exchange of notices between the petitioner and the Government wherein the petitioner was requesting for copies of documents relied upon by the Government. Ultimately, the petitioner was allowed to inspect the documents and according to the petitioner, the counsel was allowed to inspect only certain documents and the entire materials were not shown to him. Thereafter, the petitioner once again filed W.P.No.14476 of 2000 questioning the letter dated 21.8.2000 issued by the Government, wherein the Government informed the petitioner that no further extension of time will be granted for giving the reply for the show cause notice and the petitioner also sought for the relevant materials relied upon by the Government. The above Writ Petition came to be dismissed by this Court by an Order dated 25.8.2000. The petitioner thereafter gave an additional reply dated 27.8.2000 through his Counsel. 13.The Government considered the explanation given by the petitioner and G.O.Ms.No.45,       dated 12.10.2000     was    issued   and   by     virtue of   the   same, G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 was cancelled. The petitioner filed W.P.No.17844 of 2000 and challenged G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000. The Government also filed a detailed Counter in this Writ Petition. The petitioner chose to withdraw this Writ Petition on the ground that he intends to approach the Government to reconsider the G.O. and the Writ Petition, by an Order dated 22.8.2002 was dismissed as withdrawn and it was made clear that if the petitioner is aggrieved by any further decision of the Government, he was at liberty to approach the Court. 14.The petitioner made a representation dated 2.12.2002 to the Government and requested for the cancellation of G.O.Ms.No.45, releasing his payments incurred towards advertisement charges and to drop the action in the criminal case. 15.A closure report was filed in the criminal case before the concerned Court and further action was dropped and the concerned Court also passed an Order on 9.12.2004, recording the same. 16.The Collector of Chennai issued a Notice dated 31.10.2006 and initiated proceedings under the Revenue Recovery Act for the recovery of a sum of Rs.2 Crores from the petitioner. The petitioner filed W.P.No.49785 and 49786 of 2006 and challenged G.O.Ms.No.45 and also the communication dated 31.10.2006 sent by the Collector. 17.The petitioner chose to withdraw both the Writ Petitions on the ground that they once again wanted to make a representation to the Government and this Court disposed of the Writ Petitions as withdrawn and gave liberty to the petitioner if in any case, any adverse order is passed against him. Immediately thereafter a representation was made by the petitioner to the Government on 6.9.2011 and a further representation on 16.9.2011. A detailed reminder dated 11.10.2011 was also sent to the Government. 18.The Government, on considering the representations made by the petitioner, through a letter dated 2.6.2012, rejected the request made by the petitioner. The District Collector also initiated proceedings under the Revenue Recovery Act, for the recovery of a sum of Rs.2 Crores from the petitioner. 19.The petitioner has therefore filed three Writ Petitions. W.P.No.19342 of 2013, has been filed challenging the proceedings of the District Collector dated 2.7.2013. W.P.No.19343 of 2013, has been filed challenging G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000. W.P.No.19344 of 2013, has been filed challenging the letter dated 2.6.2012 issued by the Government rejecting the representations made by the petitioner. 20.The 1st respondent has filed a common counter affidavit. All the claims made by the petitioner has been refuted in the counter affidavit and the 1 st respondent has given their justification for cancelling G.O.Ms.No.324 and for initiating Revenue Recovery proceedings against the petitioner. 21.Heard Mr.G.Rajagopalan, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and Mr.U.Arun, learned Additional Advocate General for the respondents. 22.This Court has carefully considered the submissions made on either side and the 23.The main issue that has to be focused by this Court is with respect to G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000 through which the earlier G.O. in G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 was cancelled and the waiver that was granted in favour of the petitioner was withdrawn. The subject matter of challenge in W.P.No.19342 and 19344 of 2013 wherein the proceedings of the Collector of Chennai dated 2.7.2013 and the communication of the Government of Tamil Nadu, dated 2.6.2012, are consequential to G.O.Ms.No.45. Therefore, if G.O.Ms.No.45 is interfered by this Court, the consequential proceedings will automatically fall. On the other hand, if this Court does not interfere with G.O.Ms.No.45, the consequential proceedings will stand. 24.The main ground of attack by the Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of • The Government Order was passed in violation of principles of natural justice. • After the FAD report was filed in the criminal case, there is no ground to sustain the impugned G.O. • The materials relied upon by the Government was not disclosed to the petitioner. • The impugned G.O. suffers from lack of jurisdiction since the dispute between the petitioner and the Government should have been decided by a different body and the Government should not have decided its own case. • The petitioner was made to act upon G.O.Ms.No.324 and hence, G.O.Ms.No.45 is vitiated by principles of estoppel. • The impugned G.O. is vitiated by mala fides. 25.This is a peculiar case where the petitioner used his proximity with the Government which was in the helm of affairs and managed to get certain favours. The proximity of the petitioner with the head of the Government is clearly admitted by the petitioner in the affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition. The conduct of the petitioner right through also clearly indicates that he will use this Court by filing Writ Petitions whenever the political climate is not in his favour and withdraw the same once it turns in his favour. The reason as to why this Court predicated this Order with such an adverse statement, will be evident while discussing the facts of the case hereunder. 26.The     Government took a decision to use the SAF games as a viable economic proposition by commercialisation of the events involving private sector in this regard. This decision was taken on 28.7.1994 and the SAF games were planned to be conducted between 18.12.1995 to 27.12.1995. A tender was floated in this regard on 31.5.1995 and M/s. Times TV, was declared as the highest bidder and they started spending money on the advertisements. It is at this point of time, the petitioner got into the scene and he quoted an amount of Rs.2 Crores. Immediately, a discussion was held with the petitioner and he seems to have increased the offer to Rs.3 Crores. A G.O. was passed on 9.12.1995 in favour of the petitioner and a Memorandum of Understanding was also entered into with the petitioner. The G.O. as well as the Memorandum of Understanding contains various terms and conditions. After the SAF games ended, the petitioner made a request on 3.2.1996 seeking for the waiver of a sum of Rs.2 Crores and the petitioner came forward to remit only a sum of Rs.1 Crore. On 15.4.1996, the petitioner submitted a breakup of the expenditure and receipts. In this letter, there were absolutely no details or bills attached to substantiate the claim made for the expenditure incurred by the petitioner. By the time this letter was issued, the Model Code of Conduct was brought into force by the Election Commission on 10.3.1996 since the Assembly elections were slated to be held on 2.5.1996. It is quite surprising that even during this period, the request made by the petitioner was very actively considered and G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 was issued by granting waiver to the petitioner to the tune of 27.The results of the Assembly elections was declared on 9.5.1996 and the party in power lost the said election. The party which came to power found that the entire transaction was done against the interest of the State and consequently, there was a loss for the State exchequer. It was also found that the G.O. was issued inspite of the objections raised by the Finance department. It was further found that the G.O. was issued hurriedly just before the declaration of the election results and when the Model Code of Conduct was in force. Hence, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Wing registered an FIR against six accused persons and the petitioner was made as A6. The investigation was going on in this criminal case. 28.The Government took a decision to reconsider G.O.Ms.No.324 and hence issued a show cause notice dated 20.6.2000 to the petitioner calling upon the petitioner to show cause as to why the said G.O. should not be cancelled. The attempt made by the petitioner to challenge the steps taken by the Government to cancel the G.O. in W.P. 11616 of 2000 and W.P.14476 of 2000 failed and this Court directed the petitioner to submit his reply for the show cause notice. Accordingly, the petitioner also gave his reply. 29.The Government, on considering the reply given by the petitioner and various other facts and circumstances, issued G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000 cancelling G.O.Ms No.324, dated 6.5.1996. This Court carefully went through the entire G.O. and found that sufficient reasons have been assigned to justify the cancellation of G.O.Ms.No.324. Every ground that was raised by the petitioner was considered and rejected and the same is evident from paragraph 21 of the said G.O. The Government came to a categoric conclusion that it was the petitioner who volunteered and agreed to give a minimum guarantee amount of Rs.3 Crores to the Government and there was no compulsion for the petitioner if he had felt that it will not be possible for him to earn such an income. The Government also came to a conclusion that G.O.Ms. No. 324 was issued by flouting the Tamil Nadu Government Business Rules and undue favouritism was shown in favour of the petitioner. 30.The petitioner chose to challenge G.O.Ms.No.45 by filing W.P.17844 of 2000. A detailed counter affidavit was also filed by the Government justifying the issuance of the G.O. If the petitioner was really serious and aggrieved by the issuance of G.O.Ms.No.45, he should have contested this Writ Petition on merits. However, the petitioner found that there was a subsequent change in the political climate and the party which favoured him took over the reins. The petitioner obviously wanted to take advantage of the changed scenario and he consciously took a decision to withdraw the Writ Petition and accordingly, the Writ Petition was dismissed as withdrawn through an Order dated 22.8.2002. Immediately thereafter, the petitioner makes a representation dated 2.12.2002 to the Government and it will be interesting to take note of the request that was made by the petitioner which is extracted “9) Hence I request the Government. (g) To Cancell G.O.MS No.45 youth Welfare and Sports Development Department dated 12.10.2000 and restore G.O. M.S no.324 dated 6.5.96. (h) Release Payment of newspapers to us, so that we can inturn release payment to the newspapers. (i) Forthwith drop further action in crime no.8/96 DVAC Hq.” 31.The representation made by the petitioner was acted upon and as a first step, a closure report was filed before the Criminal Court and an Order was passed on 9.12.2004, closing the FIR as “further action dropped”. 32.The petitioner also started pushing for the payments made by him for advertisement and hence called upon the Government to release the payments as per G.O.Ms.No.324. At this point of time, there was once again a change in Government after the next elections. Since G.O.M.S.No.45 was in force, the Collector of Chennai called upon the petitioner to settle the sum of Rs.2 Crores, failing which, proceedings would be initiated 33.The petitioner decided to once again challenge G.O.M.S.No.45 and also the letter of the Collector informing the petitioner that proceedings will be initiated under the Revenue Recovery Act and hence, filed W.P.Nos.49785 and 49786 of 2006. Some interim orders were passed in these Writ Petitions and these Writ Petitions were pending. 34.Once again there was a change in the political climate in the year 2011.        The petitioner obviously decided to make use of the same and once again chose to withdraw both the Writ Petitions and the Writ Petitions were dismissed as withdrawn by an Order dated 30.8.2011. The petitioner also got a liberty to work out his remedy with the State Government. For the first time, the then Government was not prepared to accede to the request made by the petitioner for withdrawing G.O.Ms.No.45 and for making the payments claimed by the petitioner. Hence, the representations made by the petitioner were rejected through a communication dated 2.6.2012 and once again revenue recovery proceedings were initiated by the Collector for recovery of a sum of Rs.2 Crores from the petitioner. Once again the petitioner knocked the doors of this Court and filed the above three Writ Petitions. It is clear from the conduct of the petitioner that he will resort to legal proceedings depending upon the Government that was in the helm of affairs. By doing so, the petitioner has challenged G.O.Ms.No.45 for the third time and the revenue recovery proceedings for the second time before this Court. 35.The ground raised by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner as if, the impugned G.O. was issued in violation of principles of natural justice, is clearly unsustainable. The petitioner was put on notice and he gave detailed reply and every ground was considered and only thereafter, G.O.Ms.No.45 came to be issued. Merely because further action was dropped in the criminal case, that by itself is not a ground for withdrawing G.O.Ms.No.45 and the reasons for issuing this G.O. has been elaborately discussed in the 36.Insofar as the ground of lack of jurisdiction is concerned, it is always left open to a Government to correct its mistakes when a palpable illegality is brought to its notice. The circumstances under which G.O.Ms.No.324 was issued, is quite curious. This G.O. was issued with a tearing hurry just before the election results were announced and the powers that be went that extra mile to favour the petitioner and caused a loss of Rs.2 Crores to the State exchequer. The petitioner was bound by G.O.(D)No.177 and Memorandum of Understanding and the terms and conditions contained therein and for a commercial venture of this nature, it is too unnatural for a Government to waive the amount undertaken by the petitioner. That is the reason why this Court commented that undue favour was shown to the petitioner utilising his proximity to the then head of the Government. In view of the same, this Court holds that it was perfectly within the power and jurisdiction of the Government to issue 37.There is no question of applying the principles of estoppel in this case since G.O.Ms.No.324 was a favour that was done to the petitioner for obvious reasons and the principle of estoppel is not meant to be applied in cases of this nature. 38.The ground of mala fides raised by the Petitioner also does not pass muster. This Court has already found that there were sufficient grounds to cancel G.O.Ms.No.324 through G.O.Ms.No.45 and this was done after affording opportunity to the petitioner and after providing sufficient reasons for the cancellation of the earlier G.O. If any person chooses to conduct his business with an apparent political identity, it has its own consequences. With such a political identity, a routine ground that is always raised is mala fides when action is initiated by the subsequent Government. Mala fides is a ground which has to be pleaded and proved and it is not a matter of assumption. The petitioner has not made out a case for mala fides and G.O.Ms.No.45 gives solid reasons as to why the earlier G.O. was cancelled and it has to be sustained on its own merits. 39.The learned Additional Advocate General questioned the maintainability of these Writ Petitions on the ground that the petitioner had withdrawn the earlier Writ Petitions and hence, the present Writ Petitions are hit by the principles of res judicata. In the considered view of this Court, the petitioner managed to get some liberty from this Court and hence this Court did not want to reject the Writ Petitions on the ground of res judicata and hence, discussed the merits of the case. However, the manner in which the petitioner was filing one Writ Petition after another and withdrawing it on his own whims and fancies, is a conduct which strongly goes against the petitioner. 40.In view of the above discussion, this Court does not find any merits in the claim made by the petitioner and there are absolutely no grounds to interfere with G.O.Ms.No.45 dated 12.10.2000. Accordingly, W.P.No.19343 of 2013 is liable to be dismissed. 41.Insofar as W.P.Nos.19342 and 19344 are concerned, the impugned proceedings under challenge are consequential to G.O.Ms.No.45. Since this Court upholds G.O.Ms.No.45, the consequential proceedings will also stand and as a result, these two Writ Petitions are also liable to be dismissed. 42.The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner was continuously harping on the advertisement charges not being paid by the Government. The petitioner ought to have prosecuted and sought for the recovery of the amount in the Civil Suit. The petitioner took a calculated risk and withdrew the Civil Suit and hence he has to blame only himself for the situation in which he is placed. A litigant must understand that Court proceedings are to be taken seriously and the rights have to be agitated sincerely before a Court. The Court will come to the aid of only such litigants. Insofar as the petitioner is concerned, he was coming to this Court as if it was an amusement park and he got in and got out as per his own whims and fancies. The petitioner has to necessarily face the consequences for such a conduct. 43.In the result, all the Writ Petitions stand dismissed and the petitioner is directed to pay a cost of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) to the Chief Justice Relief Fund within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this Order.   No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

Mr. S. G. Chapalgaonkar, Advocate for Respondent no.2 1.       The appellant takes exception to the order passed by the learned Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation and Judge Labour Court at Latur in Application (WCA) No. 4 of 98 dated 2.       The facts giving rise to the Appeal were that the appellant was a driver with respondent no.1. Respondent                 No. 1 owned a truck bearing no. Mh-04-C-6933 and was insured with respondent no.2. He met with a vehicular accident on 13.04.1997. He sustained the injury to his femur and toe of the left leg. He was hospitalised for around twenty days. He sustained 35% physical disability. He was employed with respondent no.2 on the day of the accident. He could not work as before the accident. He served the     notices       to     both  respondents. However,       none       of     the respondents has paid him the compensation. Hence, he filed an application        under       Section  3  and  22    of    the      Workmen’s (“1923 Act”, for short). 3.       The learned Commissioner rejected his Claim for the reason that the appellant had already approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and had received the compensation under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988; (“M.V.Act”, for short) therefore, the Claim is barred under section 167 of the M.V. Act. Hence, this appeal. 4.       The respondents have neither denied the accident nor the relationship with the appellant. Respondent no.2/insurer objected that the application is bad for no notice under section 10 of the 1923 Act. However, the learned Commissioner has discarded the said objection and no appeal or cross-appeal is preferred against the said finding. It has also objected that the application is hit by section 167 of the M.V. Act. 5.       Heard the learned counsel Shri. B.R. Kedar for the appellant and the learned Counsel Shri S.G. Chapalgaonkar for respondent no.2 at length. None appeared for respondent no.1. 6.       Learned counsel for appellant Shri. Kedar would argue that the learned Commissioner has misread and misinterpreted section 167 of the M.V. Act. An application under Section 140 of M.V. Act has been excepted from the bar envisaged in Section 169 of M.V. Act and an application for compensation either under the Workmen’s Compensation Act or M.V. Act, is maintainable.                       He would rely on the case of Maroti Shrawan Manghate vs Smt. Rita Y. Sapra and Anr. [2018 (1) All MR. 700]. 7.       Per    contra,      learned counsel Shri.    Chapalgaonkar            for respondent no.2 would argue that after the impugned order, the appellant had filed another application under section 166 of M.V. Act. The appellant had made the incorrect statement before this court that the said application had been withdrawn. However, the copy of the order passed in the said application reveals that the said application was dismissed for default. The appellant was exercising        the     remedies   simultaneously      by    suppressing          the material facts from the court. If the said application had been withdrawn,         the     situation would   be    different.     But     the     said application was dismissed for default. Therefore, the application cannot be considered. There is no substance in the appeal. If the court concludes that the appeal deserved to be allowed, the matter should be remitted to the learned Commissioner, as the application has been decided without answering all the issues 8.       A short point that arises for consideration is, Whether the compensation granted under chapter X of the M.V. act forfeits the right of the employee to claim the compensation under section 3 of the 1923 Act as provided under Section 167 of the M.V. Act ? 9.       Before adverting to the issue involved in the appeal, it would rather be appropriate to reproduce Section 167 of the M.V.Act, “167. Option regarding claims for compensation in certain cases. — Notwithstanding anything contained in the Workmen’s Compensation Act. 1923 (8 of 1923) where the death or bodily injury to, any person gives rise to a claim for compensation under this Act and also under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, the person entitled to compensation may without prejudice to the provisions of Chapter X claim such compensation under either of those Acts but not under both.” 10.      The bare reading of the section reveals that the option as envisaged in section 167 of the M.V. Act is available only to the employees covered under the 1923 Act. It provides two forums. The option lies with an employee claiming compensation either under the 1923 Act or M. V. Act. But, employee cannot claim the compensation under both the Acts. However, chapter X of the M.V. Act is excepted from the bar envisaged in Section 169 of M.V. Act. 11.      Chapter X of the M.V. Act deals with liability without fault in certain cases. Said chapter contains Sections 140 to 144. Section 140 speaks of the liability to pay compensation in certain cases i.e death and permanent disablement, on the principle of no fault. Under this section, the person who died or sustained permanent disablement is entitled to compensation. Section 141 speaks of the other right to claim compensation for death or permanent disablement. It has been provided in the said section that the compensation under this chapter is in addition to the right to claim compensation under the principle of fault except the right to claim under      section        163-A of the  M.V.Act.    Section     142       defines permanent disablement. Section 143 speaks of the application of this chapter to certain claims under Act 8 of 1923, and Section 144 speaks of the overriding effect of the provisions of this chapter. As against this, Section 167 of the M.V. Act falls under chapter XII.           The said chapter includes the provisions for the constitution of the Claims Tribunal, application for compensation under section 166 under the principle of fault, the option of the forum to the employees covered under 1923 Act, awards of the Claim Tribunal, procedure and powers of the Claim Tribunal, impleading insurer in certain cases, award of interest, award of compensatory costs in certain cases, appeals, recovery of money from the insurer, and the powers of the State government to make 12.      Application of chapter X as envisaged in section 143 and exception of the applicability of this chapter as envisaged in section 167 should be read together to answer the point that has arisen for consideration. Section 143 is very specific that the provisions of chapter X of the M.V. Act shall apply to any claim for compensation in respect of the death or permanent disablement to any person under the 1923 Act resulting from an accident of the nature involved in sub-section (1) of Section 140 and for the said purpose the said provisions shall, with necessary modifications have been deemed to form the part of that Act. The provisions of the     Sections        are  unambiguous, that     where     the     death        or permanent disablement is caused to an employee in a vehicular motor accident, he is entitled to the compensation under the principle of no fault liability in addition to the compensation under the principle of fault liability. 13.      Section 167 barely provides for the choice of the forum to the employee. Section 3 of the 1923 Act pertains to the employer’s liability to pay compensation. The object of these two acts is to pay the compensation to an employee if he loses his life or suffers permanent, partial or permanent total disablement sustained in a vehicular motor accident. The compensation for vehicular motor accidents is covered under the M.V. Act. It also covers the compensation for the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident. However, in case the driver of such a vehicle is an employee of the owner of the vehicle. In such a case, the law has given him an option to seek compensation either under the M.V. Act or Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923.          Once the employee exercises an option under either of the law, he can not opt for the other forum after either forum passes the award. 14.      The words in section 167 of M.V.Act, “Without prejudice to the provisions of Chapter X” , are self speaking to interpret the said section that an application decided by the Claims Tribunal under section 140 of the said Act, does not bar the employee from availing remedy for compensation under the 1923 Act on the principles envisaged in the said Act. Reading section 167              would reveal that chapter X of the M.V. Act has no application while opting for the forum to claim the compensation. In other words, the reliefs granted under chapter X of the M.V. Act would not come in the way of claiming compensation before the Commissioner of Employee’s Compensation or the Claims Tribunal. 15.      The Bombay High Court at Nagpur Bench, in the case of Maroti (supra), had an occasion to deal with the similar issue. Interpreting section 167 of the M.V. Act, it has been observed in the said case that Section 167 of the M.V. Act gives the option only to proceed either under M.V. Act or W.C.Act. But it has no application to Chapter X. The right to claim compensation under W.C. Act is not forfeited upon receiving compensation on no fault 16.      By discussing the facts and law, this court concludes that Where the employee receives compensation under Chapter X of the M.V. Act, his remedy to seek compensation either under the 1923 Act or the M.V. Act cannot be forfeited under section 167. Such an employee has an option to move an application for compensation either under the 1923 Act or M.V. Act. Accordingly, the question that arisen for consideration is answered. 17.      So far as the objection that the application filed under section 166 of the M.V. Act is concerned, this court is of the view that     once      the     Commissioner  passes    an    award      under        the Employee’s Compensation Act 1923, no such application would lie before the Claims Tribunal. Otherwise, that application also did not affect      the     remedy   availed    by the     appellant     before         the 18.      The learned counsel Shri Chapalgaonkar has correctly pointed out that the learned Commissioner did not record the findings on all issues on merit. Therefore it would be inappropriate to determine the compensation here. 19.      For the aforesaid reasons, this court is of the opinion that the learned Commissioner has misread and misinterpreted Section 167 of the M.V. Act and erroneously dismissed the application of the appellant. Therefore the appeal is allowed, and the impugned order is quashed and set aside. 20.      Since all the issues have not been answered on merit, the matter        is    remitted  to   the   Commissioner        of    Employee’s Compensation at Latur for determination of the compensation afresh within six months from the receipt of this order. 21.      Records and papers are sent back to the Commissioner of Employee’s Compensation office at Latur. 22.      No orders as to costs.
Challenging the order and decree, dated 30.06.2010, passed in M.V.O.P.No.532 of 2008 on the file of the Chairman, Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal-cum-Principal District Judge, Medak at Sangareddy (for short “the Tribunal”), the claimants filed the present appeal. The claimants, who are the husband and children of one V.Pushpa (hereinafter referred to as “the deceased”), filed a petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act claiming compensation of Rs.4,50,000/- for the death of the deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on 21.05.2006. It is stated that on that day the deceased, along with others, was traveling in Innova Car bearing No.AP 29 H-4329 from Shirdi, Tuljapur to Hyderabd and when the said vehicle reached near Nirna Cross Roads on N.H.No.9, the driver of the said vehicle drove it in a rash and negligent manner with high speed and dashed to a Bus-stand building, due to which the inmates of the vehicle including the deceased sustained grievous injuries. Basing on the complaint, a case in Crime No.67 of 2006 has been registered against the driver of the Car. Immediately after the accident, the deceased was shifted to Government Hospital, Mannaekkali and she died while shifting to Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad. It is further stated that the deceased was aged about 41 years and was earning Rs.4,500/- per month as maid servant. Hence, the claimants filed claim-petition against the respondents 1 and 2, being the owner and insurer of the said Car. Before the Tribunal, the 1st respondent remained ex parte and the 2nd respondent filed counter denying the manner in which the accident took place, age, avocation and earnings of the deceased and the relationship of the claimants with the deceased. It is also denied by the 2nd respondent that the vehicle involved in the accident was insured with the 2nd respondent and the person, who drove the vehicle, was having valid and subsisting driving licence to drive such vehicle and the vehicle was roadworthy to ply.       It is further contended that the claimants are not entitled to claim interest on non-pecuniary damages and also the interest claimed is highly excessive.    In the additional counter, it is stated by the 2nd respondent that as per the police record, the crime vehicle was used for hire purpose at the time of accident and the policy was issued for private use, as such, the 1st respondent has violated the terms and conditions of the policy and, therefore, the 1st respondent alone is liable to pay the compensation and the 2nd respondent has no liability to pay any compensation and the petition is liable to be dismissed against the 2nd respondent. Basing on the above pleadings, the Tribunal framed the 1) Whether the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the crime vehicle? 2) Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation, if so, On behalf of the claimant, P.Ws.1 and 2 were examined and got marked Exs.A1 to A5. On behalf of the respondents, R.W.1 was examined and Exs.B1 to B4 were marked. After analyzing the evidence available on record, the Tribunal while awarding compensation of Rs.2,80,000/- with proportionate costs and interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of petition till realization, held that since the deceased had traveled in a hired vehicle, it is against the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and, therefore, the Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation and it is the 1st respondent, the owner of the Car, alone is liable to pay the compensation.          Challenging the said finding and also not being satisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the present appeal is filed by the claimants. Heard the learned Counsel appearing on either side and perused the record. Learned Counsel for the appellants/claimants submitted that the Tribunal dismissed the claim against the 2nd respondent on the ground that the 1st respondent has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy by using the crime vehicle for hire purpose. He further submitted that in case of violation of policy conditions including driver of the offending vehicle not having valid driving licence at the time of accident, gratuitous passenger etc., still the Insurer has to pay the compensation to the claimants at the first place and shall recover the same from the owner of the vehicle later. In support of his contention, he relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in Manuara Khatun and others v. Rajesh Kumar and others1. Insofar as the enhancement of compensation is concerned, learned Counsel for the appellants/claimants would submit that as per the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the recent decisions, the income of the housewife is to be taken at Rs.3,000/- per month and the claimants are also entitled to future prospects. It is also submitted that the Tribunal did not award any amount under conventional       heads.  Therefore,  he  prayed   to   enhance   the compensation awarded by the Tribunal. On the other hand, the learned Standing Counsel for the Insurance Company submitted that with regard to the quantum of compensation,        the  Tribunal    has  adequately    granted   the compensation and the same needs no interference by this Court. Insofar as the liability is concerned, he submits that the vehicle was used for hire purpose and the deceased was traveling in the vehicle as gratuitous passenger and, therefore, the Tribunal has rightly dismissed the claim against the 2nd respondent and the said order does not require any interference. On considering the arguments advanced by both the learned Counsel, the issues that arise for consideration in this appeal are as 1. Whether the claimants are entitled for enhancement of 2. Whether the vehicle was used for hire purpose and deceased, who was traveling in the vehicle, comes under the purview of gratuitous passenger and if the deceased comes under the purview of gratuitous passenger, pay and recovery can be ordered against the Admittedly, the claimants filed a claim-petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, and the rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of the Innova Car No.AP 29 H 4329 was proved. A perusal of the judgment of the Tribunal would show that after considering the age and avocation of the deceased, the Tribunal has rightly awarded an amount of Rs.2,80,000/- under the head of loss of income, which needs no interference.        However, in National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and others2, the Apex Court held that “the reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses should be Rs.15,000/-, Rs. 40,000/- and Rs. 15,000/- respectively”. A perusal of the impugned order would show that the Tribunal did not award any amount under conventional heads. In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in Pranay Sethi’s case (2 supra), the claimants are entitled to Rs.70,000/- under conventional heads. Thus, in all the claimants are entitled to Rs.3,50,000/-. Insofar as the liability of the 2nd respondent/Insurance Company is concerned, the Tribunal observed that R.W.1 stated in his evidence that in Ex.B4-161 Cr.P.C. statement, the witness, Krishna Reddy, stated that they hired the Innova Vehicle and traveled in it. In Rajendra Singh v. State of U.P. and another3, the Apex Court held that “the statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C. being wholly inadmissible in evidence, could not at all be taken into consideration.”        Relying upon the said judgment, in N.Rama Krishna Reddy v. M.Santhakumari and another (C.R.P.No.2939 of “It is well settled that a statement made under Section 161 Cr.P.C. is not a substantive piece of evidence. However, in view of the proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 162 Cr.P.C., the statement can be used for the limited purpose of contradicting the maker thereof in the manner set out in the said proviso.” Further, in National Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Saju P.Paul4, the Apex Court took note of entire previous case law on the subject mentioned and examined the question in the context of Section 147 of the M.V. Act. While allowing the appeal filed by the Insurance Company by reversing the judgment in Saju P.Paul v. National Insurance Co. Ltd.5 of the High Court, it was held on facts that since the victim was traveling in offending vehicle as “gratuitous passenger” and hence, the insurance company cannot be held liable to suffer the liability arising out of accident on the strength of the insurance policy. However, the Apex Court keeping in view the benevolent object of the Act and other relevant factors arising in the case, issued the directions against the Insurance Company to pay the awarded sum to the claimants and then to recover the said sum from the insured in the same proceedings by applying the principle of “pay and recover”. Recently, relying upon the said judgment, the Apex Court in Manuara Khatun (1 supra) held that the direction to the Insurance Company, being the insurer of the offending vehicle which was found involved in causing accident due to negligence of its driver needs to be issued directing them to first pay the awarded sum to the claimants and then recover the paid awarded sum from the owner of the offending vehicle in execution proceedings as per the law laid down in Para No.26 of National Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Saju P.Paul (3 supra). It is not in dispute that the Innova Car was insured and Ex.B2-Insurance Policy clearly indicates that the accident has occurred during the policy period, it can be said that the deceased was travelled as a gratuitous passenger in the crime vehicle. In Anu the Apex Court while dealing with the case of gratuitous passenger directed the insurer to pay the awarded sum to the claimant therein and recover the same from the insured in the same proceedings. For the aforesaid discussion and in view of the benevolence object of the Motor Vehicles Act, even though the liability of Insurance Company is exonerated, still the insurance company is liable to pay the compensation to the claimants at the first instance and then recover the same from the owner of the offending vehicle by invoking the principle “pay and recover” as laid down by the Apex Court in Manuara Khatun v. Rajesh Kr. Singh (1 supra). Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed by enhancing the compensation amount awarded by the Tribunal from Rs.2,80,000/- to Rs.3,50,000/- . The enhanced amount shall carry interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of passing of the order i.e., from 30.06.2010 till the date of realization. The 2nd respondent-Insurance Company is directed to deposit the said amount to the credit of the O.P. along with accrued interest within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment, and then recover the said amount from the 1st respondent-owner. The enhanced amount shall be apportioned among the claimants equally. There shall be no order as to costs. Miscellaneous petitions, if any pending in this appeal, shall stand dismissed.
1.      The petitioners, who are the convicts and undergoing the sentence of life imprisonment in view of the order dated 13.02.2015 passed by this Court in SLP (Crl.) No. 1348-49 of 2015, confirming the judgement and order dated 10.05.2013 passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur, in Criminal Appeal No. 933/2010 (arising out of Sessions Case No. 16/2006), have invoked Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking issuance of appropriate writ, order or direction commanding the respondents for presenting the case of the petitioners to the sentencing Court for fresh consideration. 2.      The present petitioners along with other co-accused having been charged for the offences under Section 147, 148, 302/149, 307/149 of IPC and Section 3(2)(5) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Corruption Act) were tried and found guilty for the said offences by the Special Judge (SC, ST), Durg, in Special Case No. 16/2006, were sentenced to life imprisonment. It was alleged against them that all the accused, 8 in number, had constituted an unlawful assembly and had killed Kartikram and Puneet using deadly weapons like sword, axe, wooden stick etc. 3.      The petitioner no.1 Jaswant Singh, aged about 63 years; petitioner no.2 Ajay, aged about 43 years and petitioner no.3 Naresh, aged about 57 years on their undergoing the sentence of imprisonment for about 16 years without remission (with remission about 21 years of imprisonment) had submitted their respective applications under Section 432(2) of Cr.PC to the Jail Superintendent, Central Jail, Durg seeking their premature release. The Jail Superintendent sought an opinion of the concerned Sessions Court which had convicted the petitioners. The Special Judge, Durg, Chhattisgarh vide the letters dated 2.7.2021, 10.8.2021 and 1.10.2021 respectively gave his opinion stating inter alia that in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, it was not appropriate to allow remission of the remaining sentence of the said petitioners. 4.      The Law Department, Government of Chhattisgarh, also vide the note dated 27.11.2021 gave an opinion that in view of the opinion given by the presiding Judge of the Sentencing Court, the petitioner no. 1 and 3 ought not to be given the benefit of the provisions of Section 433-A Cr.PC. Thereafter, the Director General, Jail and Correctional Services Chhattisgarh on 21.02.2022 referred the case of the petitioner no.2 to the Home Department, Government of Chhattisgarh and on 02.03.2022, addressed a letter to the Addl. Chief Secretary, Jail Department, Government of Chhattisgarh, for again moving the file of the petitioner no.1 and 3 for remission along with other convicts. On 22.3.2022, the Law Department, Government of Chhattisgarh once again gave its opinion that since the presiding Judge of the Sentencing Court had not given positive opinion, the petitioner no.1 and 3 should not be released on remission. The Director General, Jail and Correctional Services, therefore, rejected the applications of the petitioner no. 1 and 3 for their release on remission. It appears that the application of the respondent no.2 remained pending for consideration before the Home Department, Government of Chhattisgarh. 5.       In the meantime, one of the co-accused Ram Chander, who was also convicted along with the present petitioners in the said case, had preferred a writ petition being Writ Petition (Criminal) No.49/2022, in which this Court vide order dated 22.4.2022 directed the respondents to reconsider the case of the said petitioner and directed the Special Judge to provide an opinion afresh accompanied by adequate reasoning after taking into consideration the relevant factors laid down in Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India1. The Special Judge (Atrocities Act Durg), therefore, considering the guidelines given by this Court in Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India (supra) opined inter alia that the sentence of the prisoner Ram Chander (co-accused) could be setaside and accordingly recommended to remit his sentence. 6.       We have heard learned counsels for the parties and carefully considered the judgment and order passed by this Court in Writ Petition (Criminal) No.49/2022 filed by the co-accused Ram Chander. In the said judgment, the Coordinate Bench has considered in detail the requirement of the factors laid down in case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India (supra), to be considered by the Presiding Judge while giving opinion under Section 432(2) Cr.P.C., and the powers of the appropriate Government to suspend or remit sentences under Sections 432 and 433-A of Cr.PC. The Court in the said judgement, after considering the earlier judgements of this Court, more particularly of the Constitution Bench in case of Union of India vs. Sriharan @ Murugan2 and in case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India (supra) observed as under: - “20. In Sriharan (supra), the Court observed that the opinion of the presiding judge shines a light on the nature of the crime that has been committed, the record of the convict, their background and other relevant factors. Crucially, the Court observed that the opinion of the presiding judge would enable the government to take the ‘right’ decision as to whether or not the sentence should be remitted. Hence, it cannot be said that the opinion of the presiding judge is only a relevant factor, which does not have any determinative effect on the application for remission. The purpose of the procedural safeguard under Section 432 (2) of the CrPC would stand defeated if the opinion of the presiding judge becomes just another factor that may be taken into consideration by the government while deciding the application for remission. It is possible then that the procedure under Section 432 (2) would become a mere formality. 21.      However, this is not to say that the appropriate government should mechanically follow the opinion of the presiding judge. If the opinion of the presiding judge does not comply with the requirements of Section 432 (2) or if the judge does not consider the relevant factors for grant of remission that have been laid down in Laxman Naskar v. Union of India (supra), the government may request the presiding judge to consider the matter afresh. 22.      In the present case, there is nothing to indicate that the presiding judge took into account the factors which have been laid down in Laxman Naskar v. Union of India (supra). These factors include assessing (i) whether the offence affects the society at large; (ii) the probability of the crime being repeated; (iii) the potential of the convict to commit crimes in future; (iv) if any fruitful purpose is being served by keeping the convict in prison; and (v) the socio-economic condition of the convict’s family. In Laxman Naskar v. State of West Bengal (supra) and State of Haryana v. Jagdish (2010) 4 SCC 216, this Court has reiterated that these factors will be considered while deciding the application of a convict for premature release. 23.     In his opinion dated 21 July 2021 the Special Judge, Durg referred to the crime for which the petitioner was convicted and simply stated that in view of the facts and circumstances of the case it would not be appropriate to grant remission. The opinion is in the teeth of the provisions of Section 432 (2) of the CrPC which require that the presiding judge’s opinion must be accompanied by reasons. Halsbury’s Laws of India (Administrative Law) notes that the requirement to give reasons is satisfied if the concerned authority has provided relevant reasons. Mechanical reasons are not considered adequate. The following extract is useful for our consideration: “[005.066] Adequacy of reasons Sufficiency of reasons, in a particular case, depends on the facts of each case. It is not necessary for the authority to write out a judgement as a court of law does. However, at least, an outline of process of reasoning must be given. It may satisfy the requirement of giving reasons if relevant reasons have been given for the order, though the authority has not set out all the reasons or some of the reasons which had been argued before the court have not been expressly considered by the authority. A mere repetition of the statutory language in the order will not make the order a reasoned one. Mechanical and stereotype reasons are not regarded as adequate. A speaking order is one that speaks of the mind of the adjudicatory body which passed the order. A reason such as ’the entire examination of the year 1982 is cancelled’, cannot be regarded as adequate because the statement does explain as to why the examination has been cancelled; it only lays down the punishment without stating the causes therefor.” (Halsbury's Laws of India (Administrative Law) (Lexis Nexis, Online 24.     Thus, an opinion accompanied by inadequate reasoning would not satisfy the requirements of Section 432 (2) of the CrPC. Further, it will not serve the purpose for which the exercise under Section 432 (2) is to be undertaken, which is to enable the executive to make an informed decision taking into consideration all the relevant factors. 25.     In view of the above discussion, we hold that the petitioner’s application for remission should be reconsidered. We direct the Special Judge, Durg to provide an opinion on the application afresh accompanied by adequate reasoning that takes into consideration all the relevant factors that govern the grant of remission as laid down in Laxman Naskar v. Union of India (supra). The Special Judge, Durg must provide his opinion within a month of the date of the receipt of this order. We further direct the State of Chhattisgarh to take a final decision on the petitioner’s application for remission afresh within a month of receiving the opinion of the Special 7.      Since the case of the present petitioners is also similar to the case of the co-accused Ram Chander, in as much as the Presiding Officer’s opinions contained in the letters dated 02.07.2021, 10.08.2021 and 01.10.2021 do not contain reasons with regard to the factors to be taken into consideration as laid down in case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India (supra), we propose to pass similar order as passed in the case of co-accused Ram 8.      In that view of the matter, it is held that the petitioners’ applications for remission are required to be reconsidered by the respondent authorities afresh. Accordingly, we direct the Special Judge, Durg to provide an opinion on the applications of the petitioners afresh accompanied by adequate reasoning after taking into consideration the relevant factors that govern the grant of remission as laid down in Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India (supra).

For Petitioner(s)         :    Mr. Parvej Moyal (for wife) For Respondent(s)         :    Mr. Shadan Farasat a/w Mr. Harshit Bhurani (for husband) Reserved on 25/05/2022 1.    The   petitioner-husband          (respondent           herein    in  Petition No.1345/2018) has preferred S.B. Criminal Revision Petition (2 of 6)                  [CRLR-1345/2018] No.1095/2018 against the order dated 30.08.2018 passed by the learned Judge, Family Court No.2, Bikaner in Criminal Misc. Case No.18/2016 (268/2015), whereby the learned court below has allowed the application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. preferred by the wife, while awarding a monthly maintenance to the wife and son, to the tune of Rs.50,000/- and Rs.20,000/- (totalling Rs.70,000/-) respectively, and thus, the husband sought quashing and setting aside of the said order. The petitioner-wife (respondent herein in Petition No.1095/2018) has preferred S.B. Criminal Revision Petition  No.1345/2018,        challenging           the     same  order    dated 30.08.2018, while making prayer only to the extent that the amount of monthly maintenance, as already awarded by the learned court below, be enhanced to Rs.2,50,000/- (for wife) and Rs.1,30,000/- (for son). 2.    Mr. Shadan Farasat assisted by Mr. Harshit Bhurani, learned counsel, who appeared on behalf of the husband submitted that the marriage in this case was solemnized on 27.05.2010 at Bikaner; thereafter, the couple went to reside in United States of America (USA). Learned counsel further submitted that out of the said wedlock, Master Anay (son) was born on 21.05.2011. 2.1   Learned counsel further submitted that however, on count of the alleged disharmony in their (husband and wife) matrimonial relationship, the wife left her matrimonial home at USA on 13.11.2013 and came back to India alongwith the son. Learned counsel also submitted that thereafter, on 19.06.2015, the wife filed an application against the husband under Section 125 Cr.P.C. before the learned court below, which was allowed vide the impugned order dated 30.08.2018, while awarding the monthly (3 of 6)                   [CRLR-1345/2018] maintenance to the wife and the son (who is in custody of the wife), as mentioned above. 2.2. Learned counsel further submitted that it is an admitted position that the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- per month and staying at Hyderabad, and thus, competent to earn her own livelihood, while the husband does not oppose the maintenance granted to the son vide the impugned order. Learned counsel also submitted that the wife deserted the husband of her own sweet and free will, and thus, she is not entitled for any kind of 2.3    Learned counsel relied upon the order dated 16.09.2019 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kusum Bhatia Vs. Sagar       Sethi      (Special           Leave             to   Appeal        (C) No(s).16051/2017. Learned counsel further relied upon the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Deb 303, and the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in K.N. Vs. R.G., 2019 SCC Online Del 7704. 3.     On the other hand, Mr. Parvej Moyal, learned counsel for the wife submitted that the husband is taking the plea of desertion by the wife, merely to deny maintenance to her, as awarded by the learned court below, whereas, he himself had sought divorce in the Court at USA and the same was ex parte done in favour of the husband on 29.04.2015, while passing the necessary decree. 3.1    Learned counsel further submitted that there is no factual dispute to the extent that the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- and husband     is  earning     about       15000         US$,     which   comes     to Rs.11,62,000/- (INR per month). (4 of 6)               [CRLR-1345/2018] 3.2  Learned counsel also submitted that in accordance with the precedent law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Rajnesh Vs. Neha & Anr., AIR 2021 SC 569, even if the wife is earning, then also she is entitled for the determination of maintenance, in accordance with the lifestyle of her husband in the matrimonial home. Relevant portion of the judgment rendered in Rajnesh Vs. Neha & Anr. (supra), reads as under: The Courts have held that if the wife is earning, it cannot operate as a bar from being awarded maintenance by the husband. The Courts have provided guidance on this issue in the following judgments. In Shailja & Anr. v Khobbanna, this Court held that merely because the wife is capable of earning, it would not be a sufficient ground to reduce the maintenance awarded by the Family Court. The Court has to determine whether the income of the wife is sufficient to enable her to maintain herself, in accordance with the lifestyle of her husband in the matrimonial home. Sustenance does not mean, and cannot be allowed to mean mere survival. In Sunita Kachwaha & Ors. v Anil Kachwaha the wife had a postgraduate degree, and was employed as a teacher in Jabalpur. The husband raised a contention that since the wife had sufficient income, she would not require financial assistance from the husband. The Supreme Court repelled this contention, and held that merely because the wife was earning some income, it could not be a ground to reject her claim for maintenance. The Bombay High Court in Sanjay Damodar Kale v Kalyani Sanjay Kale while relying upon the judgment in Sunita Kachwaha (supra), held that neither the mere potential to earn, nor the actual earning of the wife, howsoever meagre, is sufficient to deny the claim of maintenance. (5 of 6)                  [CRLR-1345/2018] An able-bodied husband must be presumed to be capable of earning sufficient money to maintain his wife and children, and cannot contend that he is not in a position to earn sufficiently to maintain his family, as held by the Delhi High Court in Chander Prakash Bodhraj v Shila Rani Chander Prakash. The onus is on the husband to establish with necessary material that there are sufficient grounds to show that he is unable to maintain the family, and discharge his legal obligations for reasons beyond his control. If the husband does not disclose the exact amount of his income, an adverse inference may be drawn by the This Court in Shamima Farooqui v Shahid Khan cited the judgment in Chander Prakash (supra) with approval, and held that the obligation of the husband to provide maintenance stands on a higher pedestal than the wife. 3.3    Learned counsel thus submitted that the sustenance does not mean and cannot be allowed to mean a mere survival, and the lifestyle at Hyderabad, where the wife alongwith her son is presently residing, is very costly, and the son is also going in a good and reputed school at Hyderabad, the expenditure whereof is also too high. Learned counsel thus submitted that even if the wife is earning something, then also she is entitled to claim the necessary and adequate maintenance from her husband. 4.     After hearing learned counsel for the parties as well as perusing the record of the case along with the precedent laws cited at the Bar, this Court holds that merely the fact that the wife is earning would not dis-entitle her from the maintenance. The husband himself has taken the divorce on 29.04.2015, fact not in dispute, and therefore, the charge of desertion cannot become a ground so as to enable the husband to disqualify the wife from (6 of 6)                   [CRLR-1345/2018] claiming the amount of monthly maintenance, in any manner whatsoever. 5.     The learned trial court, vide the impugned order, has rightly arrived at a considered decision and looking to the cost of living at Hyderabad and the fact that both the husband and wife were maintaining a very good lifestyle in USA, which is clearly apparent on the face of the record, it would be appropriate to dispose the present     petitions,    while    enhancing           the     amount    of  monthly maintenance payable by the husband to the wife and son. 6.     This   Court    finds     that     the      husband        is earning    about Rs.12,00,000/- per month and the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- per month, and therefore, a very reasonable capacity of the husband to pay the maintenance should be 1/12th of his income, which shall take care of the husband’s claim for high cost of living in 7.     In view of the above, the amount of monthly maintenance as awarded by the learned court below, vide the impugned order dated 30.08.2018, to the wife and the son, is enhanced to Rs.75000/- (for wife) and Rs. 25000/- (for son). The impugned order dated 30.08.2018 stands modified accordingly. 8.     In light of the observations made hereinabove and the modification in the impugned order passed by the learned court below, the present petitions stand disposed of. All pending applications also stand disposed of.

Heard Ms.Madhvi Gonathieswaran for Applicant and Mr.Ajay Patil, APP for State. 3.     Ms.Gonathieswaran submitted that, marriage of daughter of Digitally signed Applicant namely Ms.Nandini is scheduled on 24 th February 2023 at Kolhapur.    That, presence of Applicant being father of bride is 2 of 3                20.IA.673.2023.doc necessary to perform religious functions and/or rituals. The venue of the marriage is about 10 kilometers from Kolhapur Central Prison, Kalamba and within the periphery of 1.5 kilometers of Shahupuri Police Station, Kolhapur.

I was recently hearing a matter pertaining to the affairs of a registered society. I posed a casual question whether the membership of the society is confined to any particular caste. The counsel for the petitioner    exclaimed in disbelief-”Milord, the society is named after V.O.C”. I understood what he meant. For the uninitiated, I must clarify that only those belonging to Pillaimar community can become the members of the society. 2.We are celebrating the 75th year of independence. An iconic freedom writer who sacrificed his everything for the sake of the nation has been reduced into a caste symbol. The very same fate has befallen many others too. Such thoughts crossed my mind as I heard the petitioner in person. He is a 4th year law student in Government Law College, Theni. He had been suspended by the impugned order which also proposes to initiate disciplinary action against him. 3.His sin ?. He wanted installation of the portrait of Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar in the office room of the Principal. He also wanted the course to be taught in Tamil.         Both these demands are unexceptionable. But the petitioner had conducted himself in a manner so as to raise the hackles of the college administration. He is alleged to have uttered rude and defiant words at the Principal.        He had barged into the class rooms when the classes were going on. His mobilization efforts were seen as acts of indiscipline and misconduct. That led to the issuance of the impugned proceedings. 4.The would-be lawyer argued his case in person. He denied the imputations made against him. He asserted his innocence. I could not have gone into the factual aspects. If the petitioner is made to face the enquiry, the consequences looked uncertain.         In the writ petition, the petitioner had impleaded three of his professors in person.       When allegations of mala fide are made, the respondent concerned has to be given an opportunity to file counter-affidavit to controvert the same. If the matter is dealt with in routine course, it may not be taken up in the foreseeable future. I therefore suggested to the petitioner to give up the respondents named in person.          I indicated that he could give a handwritten letter of apology addressed to the Principal, in which event, I could persuade the college management to give a quietus to the issue.      The writ petition was listed for admission on 10.08.2022.     I posted the matter for disposal on 12.08.2022. I made it clear that on 12.08.2022, the government counsel must report that the portrait of Dr.Ambedkar had been put up in the office room of the Principal. 5.When the matter was taken up today, the government counsel informed the court that in the office room of the Principal, the portrait has been installed. This probably encouraged the petitioner     to accept my suggestion. He wrote out a handwritten letter expressing his unconditional apologies to the Principal.       This was handed over to a teaching staff of the college in my presence. 6.The petitioner belongs to a Scheduled Caste community. He had not indulged in any act of violence. He had merely taken up a legitimate public cause. He is now in the fourth year. He had expressed his sincere apologies. Therefore, the principle of proportionality demands that the matter is given a quietus. The petitioner had already been kept away from the classes for two weeks. He does not deserve to suffer anything more. I therefore direct the fourth respondent to treat the matter as closed. I make it clear that the petitioner shall not suffer any stigma. 7.The issue regarding the portrait of Dr.Ambedkar has been considered in quite a few judicial decisions. A bank employee was even dismissed from service when he attempted to forcibly install the portrait without getting permission from his superiors.    A Division Bench of the Madras High Court vide order dated 04.02.2016 in WA No.884 of 2015 came to his rescue. There is a reference to the Circular issued by the Banking Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India in F.No.5/7/2006-SCT(B) dated 08.09.2006 which directs the nationalised banks to put up the portrait of Dr.Ambedkar. G.O.(Ms)No.2363 Public (General I) Department          dated 24.10.1990 issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu states that in addition to the nine portraits named in the G.O, the portrait of Dr.B.R.Ambedkar can also be displayed in Public Offices and building. The expression “also” occurring in the G.O deserves to be noted. Probably, the subsequent political developments catapulted the icon and in G.O.(Ms)No.457 Public (General I) Department, dated 04.06.2006, Dr.Ambedkar got to be included at Serial No.(K).     When WP No.875 of 2021 was filed before the First Bench for directing the government to display the portrait of the incumbent Prime Minister of India and President of India in all the government offices and public buildings in the State of Tamil Nadu as per the aforesaid G.O, the learned Advocate General appearing for the State submitted that the relevant notification gives an option to the Government offices to carry one or more of the photographs of the several national leaders. 8.Dr.Ambedkar is the architect of the Indian Constitution. He is the very symbol of social liberation. His scholarship is unparalleled. He can be the greatest inspiration for every law student. The Director of Legal Studies, Chennai is requested to issue circular mandating the installation of the portrait of Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar in all the Government Law Colleges in Tamil Nadu. 9.I did deal with the petitioner with an element of harshness during court proceedings. Of course, my intention was to ensure that the petitioner did not end up a martyr but as a lawyer at the end of his academic studies.       It is quite possible that the petitioner nurtures a sense of hurt. I had directed remittance of cost of Rs.10,000/- in one case in favour of Madurai Bench of Madras High Court Advocates Welfare Board Trust. I had indicated that the money was to be spent for the welfare of a law student belonging to scheduled caste. The said Trust is called upon to pay a sum of Rs.10,000/- to the petitioner. It will help him to buy some standard law texts which can be the foundation for his law library.       Dr.Ambedkar said “Be Educated, Be Organised and Be Agitated”.         The petitioner must focus on the first advice for the next two years. 10.Charity should begin at home. As I was finalizing the draft order dictated in the open court, I looked around. I confess that the photograph of Dr.Babasaheb is not on the walls of my chambers. I resolved to make good the omission at the earliest. 11.This writ petition stands disposed of accordingly. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
Sri.Sagar.,   learned   counsel., for the  petitioner has appeared in person. Sri. Gopalkrishna Soodi., learned counsel for respondent No.1 has appeared through video conferencing. 2.     The brief facts are these: It is stated that the petitioner was working as Circle Inspector at D.R.B.C Branch, Chikkaballapur at the time of the alleged incident. Later, he was promoted and he was posted at It is averred that the second respondent telephoned the petitioner on 26.09.2010 and informed him that on 19.09.2010 that while having food at the LVT Daba, he had a scuffle with a person named Mr.Lakshmikanth and 15 others concerning the payment of commission for purchasing land. The second respondent requested the petitioner to register a case based on the complaint given to the Doddaballapur Police Station. Based WP No. 51993 of 2015 on the request, the petitioner telephoned the PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar, and instructed him to take necessary action. Pursuant to   the  complaint   given   by   the  second  respondent  on 26.09.2010 the Police Sub-Inspector -Mr.Rajendra Kumar., filed FIR in Cr.No.107/2010 for the alleged offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 342, 323, 324, 506(b), 327 read with Section 149 of IPC against Mr.Lakshmikanth and fifteen Thereafter, the PSI being the Investigating Officer, conducted the investigation and filed a charge sheet with Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Doddaballapur. Based on the charge sheet, the Court conducted proceedings and passed the Judgment     acquitting   the   accused   Mr.Lakshmikanth   on As things stood thus, Sri.K.A.Appanna - the second respondent filed a complaint with the Karnataka State Human Rights Commission against the petitioner and Mr.Rajendra Kumar, the PSI of Doddaballapur. Based on the complaint, the Commission sent a copy of the complaint to the Inspector General of Police, Karnataka Human Rights Commission for WP No. 51993 of 2015 conducting an inquiry and to submit a report. Accordingly, the IGP, KHRC after conducting an inquiry, submitted a report. Based on the report submitted by IGP, KHRC proves the charges only against Mr.Rajendra Kumar, PSI Doddaballapur. The Commission issued notice to Mr.Rajendra Kumar on 30.04.2012 to give a written reason for the report submitted by the Inspector General of Police, Karnataka Human Rights Commission. Accordingly, Mr.Rajendra Kumar submitted a written    statement   of   reason    justifying  his   actions. Subsequently, the Commission based on the complaint, report of  IGP,   KHRC,   and  a  written   statement   of  reason  by Mr.Rajendra Kumar, PSI Doddaballapur vide order           dated 20.06.2015. imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) not only on Mr. Rajendra Kumar’s PSI but also on the petitioner. Under these circumstances, the petitioner left with no other alternative and efficacious remedy is filing this Writ Petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of Learned counsel for the petitioner and respondent No.1 urged several contentions. 4.    Heard, the contentions urged on behalf of the respective parties and perused the Writ papers and also the Annexures with utmost care. Sri.Sagar., learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that the petitioner being the Circle Inspector has discharged his duties honestly and obediently. He argued that the moment the petitioner received a telephone call from the complainant – the second respondent, he properly instructed the PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar to act in accordance with the law. He argued by saying that under his direction, the PSI filed FIR in Crime No.107/2010. Hence, there is no dereliction of duty as noticed by the Commission. Counsel, therefore, submits that the order passed by the Commission imposing a penalty of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) on the petitioner is By way of answer, Sri.Gopalkrishna Soodhi., learned counsel for Commission submits that the Commission has found that  the   petitioner  being the   Circle  Inspector  has  not discharged his duties properly. Hence, taking note of the material evidence on record, in particular the statements which WP No. 51993 of 2015 are recorded before the Commission, the Commission justified in imposing a penalty. Counsel, therefore, sought to justify the order passed by the Commission. The short point which arises for my consideration is: Is the imposition of a penalty on the The facts have been sufficiently stated and the same does not require reiteration. Suffice it to note that the petitioner being the Circle Inspector    received    a  telephone    call   from   the   second respondent. A request was made by the second respondent to register a case based on his complaint. It is seen from the records that the petitioner being the Circle Inspector instructed the Police Sub-Inspector - Mr.Rajendra Kumar on the very same day and directed him to take necessary action. The    second    respondent    gave    the    complaint   on 26.09.2010. Thereafter, the PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar filed an FIR   in  Cr.No.107/2010.     It  is  pivotal  to   note   that the Investigating Officer conducted an investigation and filed a charge    sheet    with   the   Addl.   Civil  Judge    and   JMFC, WP No. 51993 of 2015 Doddaballapur. The Court conducted proceedings and the same was    ended    in  the  order  of  acquittal   of  the accused As things stood thus, for the best reasons known to the second respondent, complained to the Karnataka Human Rights Commission that there is a dereliction of duty by the petitioner. It is further relevant to note that based on the complaint, the Commission proceeded in the matter.         In my opinion, the giving of the complaint and the initiation of the proceedings by the commission is unsustainable in law. law. The reason is quite simple.    Proceedings before the appropriate forum have been concluded. It is pivotal to note that the order of acquittal was passed by the court. If the second respondent had any grievance or was not satisfied with the order of acquittal of Mr.Lakshmikanth, the proper course would have been in a different Forum altogether. Furthermore, even the finding of the commission that the petitioner has not instructed the PSI in writing is wholly incorrect and untenable. It is common sense that the Circle Inspector is higher in ranking than the Police Sub-Inspector. Based on a telephone call the petitioner has WP No. 51993 of 2015 directed the official concerned i.e., PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar to act in accordance with the law. It is needless to observe that legal action was set in motion and the Court has passed the Judgment as per the law. Therefore, in my opinion, there is no dereliction of duty as alleged by the complainant.       I may venture to say that the commission has failed to have regard to relevant considerations and disregarded relevant matters. In my considered opinion, the imposition of penalty so far as the petitioner is concerned is unsustainable in law. Hence, the same is liable to be set aside. The result is that the Writ Petition will be allowed. This court orders a writ of Certiorari. The order dated:20.06.2015 passed      by     the    Human        Rights    Commission     in H.R.C.No.4860/2011(SB-1)        vide    Annexure-A    imposing   a penalty of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) in so far as the petitioner is concerned is set-aside. Resultantly, the Writ Petition is allowed.
1.          Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 10.06.2022 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Criminal Petition No. 3492/2022, by which, the High Court has released respondent No. 2 herein on bail in connection with an FIR/Crime No. 8/2022 registered with Laxmipura Police Station, Mysuru City for the offences punishable under Sections 376, 354, 328 and 120B of IPC, the original informant/complainant/prosecutrix/victim has preferred Digitally signed by R 2.  We have heard Ms. Jayna Kothari, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, Shri Shubhranshu Padhi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State and Dr. Aditya Sondhi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No. 2 – accused. We have gone through and perused the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court releasing respondent No. 2 on bail. 2.1 From the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that what has weighed with the High Court is that the complaint was filed after five days and the allegations that the accused had mixed some substance in the drinks that made her lose consciousness and thereafter, he committed the offence on intoxicating her and subjected her to the sexual act, is a matter of trial and that the accused is in custody from 11.02.2022 and there is no need of further custodial trial. The relevant observations made in paragraph 6 of the impugned order while releasing respondent No. 2 – accused on bail are as “6. Having heard the respective counsel appearing for the parties and also on perusal of the material available on record, the Court has to take note of the contents of the allegations and also the complaint is filed after five days, wherein an allegation is made that this petitioner mixed some substance in the drinks to loose her conscious and thereafter he committed the offence and the fact that both of them went to Bopy’s Bar & Restaurant in order to take food and also had alcohol. Having taken note of the said fact into consideration whether intoxicating her subjected her to sexual act is a matter of trial and this petitioner is in custody from 11.02.2022 and no need of further custodial trial. Hence, it is a fit case to exercise the powers under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., subject to imposing certain conditions to protect and safeguard the interest of the prosecution.” 2.2 However, the High Court has failed to appreciate the allegations in the FIR that immediately on the occurrence, when the prosecutrix/victim regained consciousness, she first went to the hospital and thereafter, tried to lodge the FIR but no complaint was taken. In a case like this, the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that there could have been some delay (though in the present case, it may not be said that there was any inordinate delay in lodging the FIR) as sometime could have been consumed for the victim/prosecutrix to get out of the shock. Even the said aspect is required to be considered at the time of the trial. 2.3 Even otherwise, from the reasoning given, it appears that the High Court has not at all considered the seriousness of the allegations and the gravity of the offences alleged against the accused. It is reported that the chargesheet has already been filed. So, whatever material has been collected during the investigation was required to be considered by the High Court while considering the application under Section 439 of Cr.PC. 2.4 Even the observation that there is no need of further custodial trial is also not relevant aspect while considering the bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C.        The same may have some relevance while considering the application for anticipatory bail. 2.5 Having regard to the fact that while releasing respondent No. 2 – accused on bail the High Court has not taken into consideration the relevant aspects which are required to be kept in mind while considering the bail application, namely, seriousness of the offence alleged; material collected  during   the  investigation; statement   of  the prosecutrix recorded under Section 161 of Cr.PC, etc., the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is unsustainable. Considering the fact that the chargesheet has already been filed, the accused is already charge­ sheeted and the relevant material is also now a part of the chargesheet, the same is required to be considered by the High Court. Therefore, the matter ought to be remitted to the High Court to consider the bail application afresh and pass appropriate orders after considering the relevant material/evidence collected during the investigation which are now a part of the chargesheet. 3. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present Appeal Succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court releasing respondent No. 2 – accused on bail, deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. The matter is remitted to the High Court to decide the bail application afresh in accordance with law and on its own merits after perusing    the  material/evidence    collected  during the investigation which are now a part of the chargesheet and upon taking into consideration the relevant aspects which are required to be kept in mind while examining the prayer for bail. 4.   As the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court releasing respondent No. 2 – accused on bail has been set aside, respondent No. 2 – accused is directed to surrender before the concerned Court/Jail Authority within a period of one week from today and only thereafter, the High Court shall decide and dispose of the bail application   afresh,   as  observed   hereinabove,  at the earliest. With this, the present appeal is allowed.
This appeal is filed by the original petitioner to challenge the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 10.12.2021.                       The appellant was engaged as a constable-driver in CRPF.                     He was granted leave from 21.08.2013 to 19.09.2013.                    He however did not report for duty on completion of leave period.                  He remained unauthorisedly absent without sanction of leave from 20.09.2013 on   wards   without    any    intimation         to     the  department.    The departmental enquiry was therefore initiated against him. He did not participate in the enquiry.           Final order was passed by the (2 of 4)               [SAW-333/2022] disciplinary authority on 10.09.2014 imposing punishment of dismissal. During the enquiry it appears that the department had discharged the charge-sheet, list of witnesses, enquiry officer’s report at all stages but there was no response from the petitioner. The petitioner had challenged the order of the disciplinary authority. The appellate authority converted the order of dismissal to removal from service. Eventually the petitioner approached this Court and challenged the punishment imposed on him. His petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge upon which this appeal has been filed. Appearing for the appellant-original petitioner it is submitted that looking to the long clean service of the petitioner extreme punishment of removal from service should not have been imposed. He submitted that the petitioner was suffering from illness on account of which he could not resume his duties.                 He lastly  contended    that    none       of    the      communications  of  the department reached to him because the petitioner was not living at his residence. In support of his contentions he relied on following decisions:- (1) In case of Veerendra Kumar Dubey Vs. Chief of Army Staff and Ors., reported in (2016) 2 Supreme Court Cases (2) In case of Roop Singh Negi Vs. Punjab National Bank and Ors., reported in (2009) 2 Supreme Court Cases 570; (3) In case of Krushnakant B. Parmar Vs. Union of India and Anr., reported in (2012) 3 Supreme Court Cases 178; (4) In case of Bhagwan Lal Arya Vs. Commissioner of Police, Delhi and Ors., reported in 2004 (3) SLR 70; (3 of 4)                [SAW-333/2022] (5) In case of Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Coal India Limited and Another. Vs. Mukul Kumar Choudhuri and Others., reported in (2009) 15 Supreme Court Cases 620. In our view the petitioner has not made out any case for interference. We may recall, the petitioner was engaged as constable of CRPF which is a disciplined force. He remained unauthorisedly absent without sanctioned leave or communication to the department for about one year.                  This was a clear case of misconduct.   Section 10 of the Central Reserve Police Force Act, 1949 (in short ‘the Act’) pertains to less heinous offences and includes the act of a member of the force of remaining absent himself without leave, or without sufficient cause overstaying the leave granted to him. For any such less heinous offences the punishment prescribed under Section 10 of the said Act is of imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to three months’ pay, or with both. Section 11 pertains to minor punishments. Sub-section (1) of Section 11 provides that the commandant or any other authority or officer as may be prescribed, may, subject to any rules made under the Act, award in lieu of, or in addition to, suspension or dismissal any one or more of the punishments to any member of the force whom he considers to be guilty of disobedience, neglect of duty, or remissness in the discharge of the duty or any duty or other misconduct in his capacity as a member of the force. One of the punishments prescribed is removal from the office. Thus for the act of remaining absent without leave, under Section 10 the competent authority could impose a punishment of imprisonment. Under Section 11 the punishment of dismissal or (4 of 4)                   [SAW-333/2022] removal from service can also be considered.                     As noted, the disciplinary authority had imposed the punishment of dismissal from service which was converted by the appellate authority to removal from service. These punishments are thus within the competence of the said authority to impose. The misconduct of not reporting for duty for over one year without sanctioned leave was established during the course of enquiry. The petitioner has not produced any evidence of his suffering from such illness which prevented him from resuming his duty and which prevented him from appearing in the departmental enquiry and any rate from communicating to the department his inability to appear. All communications were made by the department at his residential address. Despite which the petitioner did not appear before the disciplinary authority. The petitioner cannot complain that the enquiry was conducted ex-parte. Under the circumstances, we do not find any reason to interfere. The case of punishment essentially rests with the disciplinary authority. The Court would not interfere unless the punishment shocks the conscience of the Court. Reference in this respect can be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of B.C. Chaturvedi Vs. Union of India and Ors., reported in AIR 1996 SC 484.
Heard Mr. Rosangzuala Ralte, learned counsel for the petitioners. Also heard Mr. L.H. Lianhrima, learned senior counsel assisted by Ms. Ruth Lalruatfeli for the respondent No. 1. None appears for the respondent Nos. 2 & 3 despite notice. I have also heard Mr. C. Zoramchhana, learned Additional Advocate General for the respondent No. 4. [2.]           This writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is filed by the petitioners challenging the Settlement dated 26.09.2015, reached by the parties concerned before the Lok Adalat sitting held in the Office of the District Level Services Authority, [3.]           Brief facts of the case may be noticed at the outset. One Shri. K. Rochhinga was the owner of LSC No. 145 of 1977, where he constructed his dwelling house. He resided in the said property during his lifetime. He expired leaving behind his 5 (five) children i.e., 3 (three) sons and 2 (two) daughters. The original respondent No. 2 in the instant writ petition who expired on 25.03.2019 was the eldest amongst the 5 (five) children of Shri. K. Rochhinga (L), while the respondent No. 1 is the second eldest. The father of the three petitioners i.e., Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma who WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                        2|Page expired on 06.05.2014 is the youngest amongst the five children of Shri. K. Rochhinga (L) and even after the death of Shri. K. Rochhinga, he continued to live in the main house which was constructed on LSC No. 145 of 1977. Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma (L) had two wives. Out of the first marriage with Smt. Biaklianpuii, the three petitioners were born. From his second marriage with Smt. Rohlupuii, two children namely, Alex Lalfakawma and Judy Lalrinzuali were born. [4.]           Soon after Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma expired, the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 filed Title Suit No. 7/2014 against Smt. Rohlupuii, the second wife of Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma (L) in the Court of the Senior Civil Judge, Lunglei claiming for a declaration that they are the bonafide owner of the land and buildings in respect of LSC No. 209001/01/39 of 2012 and LSC No. 145 of 1977, including the buildings located at Lunglawn and Electric Veng respectively and also other properties left behind by late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. It was during the pendency of the said Title Suit that the matter was referred to the Lok Adalat at Lunglei and consequently, a Settlement dated 26.09.2015 was arrived at by the parties concerned. The English translation of the Settlement dated 26.09.2015 is abstracted Both parties are present in the Lok Adalat sitting, the following are the issues; Pu K. Vanlaltluanga is the elder brother of Rohlupuii’s husband viz; K. Vanlalmalsawma. K. Vanlalmalsawma died on 6.6.2014 and the properties left behind by him have been agreed to be distributed in the following manner and thus the parties could come to a Pu K. Vanlaltluanga shall get the following properties; 1) LSC No. 145 of 1777 located at Electric Veng (which is in the name of Pu K. Rochhunga (L) 2) ALTO Car bearing registration No. MZ 02 A 0202 3) The money in K. Vanlalmalsawma’s Lunglei Apex Bank Account will be equally shared by the following :- The money to be shared is Rs. 191366 and the same shall be shared equally by the five persons mentioned above within a week from now. Pi Rohlupuii will get the following properties : 2)      Pi Rohlupuii will be in temporary possession of land covered by LSC No. 209001/01/39 at 2012 at Lunglawn, Lunglei and the RCC building standing there until her son Alex Lalfakawma attains majority as per government laws. As and when Alex Lalfakawma attains majority, Pi Rohlupuii shall take steps to mutate the ownership of LSC No. 209001/01/39 of 2012 in the name of Alex Lalfakawma. Since Alex Lalfakawma is the owner of this land, no one is permitted to sell or make changes to the said land until he attains To show that they are agreeable to the settlement made both parties have subscribed their signatures. The properties to be shared are to be settled one week from today. [5.]          Aggrieved with the above agreement, the petitioners are before this Court through the instant writ petition. [6.]           Mr. Rosangzuala Ralte, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are the children of late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma, who expired on 06.05.2014. At the relevant time, the petitioners were only minors and they were of the bonafide belief that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 were taking proper care of their interest and welfare in respect of the properties and other belongings left behind by their late father, including LSC No. 145 of 1977, where the main house was situated and in which they were living. However, to the surprise of the petitioners, they came to learn that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 on one side and Smt. Rohlupuii, the second wife of their father on the other side made a settlement before the Lok Adalat on 26.09.2015 by distributing the properties amongst themselves as stated in the settlement and without leaving any share for the petitioners on the property left behind by their late [7.]           The learned counsel by referring to the cause title and contents of the Title Suit No. 7/2014 submits that the declaration of right and title over the properties mentioned in the suit by the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 as plaintiffs are clearly the properties left behind by their late father Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. Therefore, the said settlement could not have been made in their absence and excluding them from inheriting any of the properties left behind by their late father. He therefore submits that being aggrieved with the WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                         5|Page same and having no other alternative, the petitioners have filed the instant writ petition. He submits that a Lok Adalat settlement can be challenged before a Writ Court, as held by the Apex Court in the case of State of Punjab & Anr. Vs. Jalour Singh & Ors., reported in (2008) 2 SCC 660. The learned counsel further submits that pursuant to the settlement, the respondent No. 1 has mutated the LSC No. 145 of 1977 into his name after obtaining Heirship Certificate in the year 2018. Apprehending that they will be ousted from the main house standing on LSC No. 145 of 1977, the petitioners have filed the instant writ petition. He thus submits that the impugned settlement should be set aside and the matter remanded back for re- consideration by the Trial Court. [8.]           Mr. L.H. Lianhrima, learned senior counsel on the other hand submits that a writ does not lie against a private person who does not have a public duty to perform. In this connection, he relies upon the case of Radhey Shyam & Anr. Vs. Chhabi Nath & Ors., reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423. He further submits that although the Revenue Department has been made a party respondent in the present writ petition, but the fact remains that they were not a party before the Trial Court. The learned senior counsel further submits that in view of the Apex Court decision in State of Punjab & Anr. Vs. Jalour Singh & Ors. (Supra), a writ petition under Article 227 may lie against the settlement made before a Lok Adalat on limited grounds. However, the instant writ petition is filed under Article 226 of the WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                        6|Page Constitution of India by the petitioners and therefore, the same is not maintainable. [9.]           Mr. L.H. Lianhrima further submits that there is inordinate delay on the part of the petitioners in filing the present writ petition, inasmuch as, the impugned agreement before the Lok Adalat was made on 26.09.2015 and by which time, the petitioner No. 1 in particular having being born on 15.03.1997 was already a major. Despite the same, the petitioners have only approached this Court by filing the instant writ petition on 20.06.2019. He submits that to avail a remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the party aggrieved should approach the Court at the earliest opportunity. The power conferred to the Court being an extra original power, it is the sole discretion of the Court to entertain the writ petition and inordinate delay is one of the ground available to the Court to refuse the exercise of its discretion. Under the facts and circumstances, the learned senior counsel submits that the writ petition should be dismissed. [10.]          Mr. C. Zoramchhana, learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the respondent No. 4 submits that he has nothing much to say, inasmuch as, the respondent No. 4 is only a proforma respondent and has no role to play in the present [11.]          I have heard the submissions made by the learned counsels for the rival parties and I have perused the materials available on record. [12.]          From what has been narrated hereinabove, it may be seen that Shri. K. Rochhinga (L) was the original owner of LSC No. 145 of 1977 and he is the grandfather of the petitioners. During his lifetime, the father of the petitioners was allowed to live in the main house which is situated on the said LSC. He however expired on 06.05.2014 and the said LSC continued to remain in the name of Shri. K. Rochhinga (L). In other words, Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma did not inherit the property left behind by Shri. K. Rochhinga, his father. Further, living in the main house by itself cannot imply that the property of Shri. K. Rochhinga stood transferred to the occupant of the property/house namely, Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. From a perusal of the pleadings in Title Suit No. 7/2014, it can be seen that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 sought for a declaration of their right to title and ownership over the land and buildings covered by LSC No. 209001/01/39 of 2012 located at Lunglawn, Lunglei and LSC No. 145 of 1977 located at Electric Veng, Lunglei and also the properties left behind by their deceased brother Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma in their favour. The suit was filed against Smt. Rohlupuii, the second wife of [13.]          During the pendency of the Suit, the same was referred for settlement before the Lok Adalat and accordingly, vide the settlement dated 26.09.2015 was arrived at by the parties WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                         8|Page concerned. As per the settlement, LSC No. 145 of 1977 which was in the name of Shri. K. Rochhinga was given to the respondent No. 1 and likewise, Alto Car bearing registration No. MZ 02 A-0202 was also given to him. The money in the bank account of Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma was to be shared equally by all the 5 (five) children of late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma, including the three petitioners. In respect of Scooty bearing registration No. MZ 01 A-2239 and LSC No. 209001/01/39 of 2012, the same was given to the defendant Smt. Rohlupuii with a condition in respect of the LSC that she will mutate the ownership of the said property in the name of her son, Alex Lalfakawma once he attains the age of majority. It may be noticed that the petitioners while praying for setting aside the Settlement dated 26.09.2015 in this writ petition has mainly sought for the cancellation of Heirship Certificate No. 311 of 2018 and the mutation of LSC No. 145 of 1977 in the name of the respondent No. 1. [14.]          As    already     stated    hereinabove,    Shri.   K. Vanlalmalsawma during his lifetime did not inherit the land and property covered by LSC No. 145 of 1977. If such is the case, there cannot be any basis for the petitioners to make a claim for the said property on the strength of being the daughters of late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. It is also noted herein that the petitioner No. 3 during the pendency of this writ petition expired on 24.10.2019 and therefore, it is only the petitioner Nos. 1 & 2, who remain to make their claims. Although the petitioners have tried to project that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 have committed fraud or mis-represented WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                       9|Page them in respect of the properties left behind by their late father but however, the fact remains that the petitioners were also given their share of the money left behind by the late father along with their other siblings born from their step-mother. The respondent Nos. 1 & 2 in their Title Suit also sought for a declaration of the properties left behind by late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma in their names. Therefore, it is not a case of fraud or misrepresentation as sought to be projected by the petitioners. [15.]           The Apex Court in the case of State of Punjab & Anr. Vs. Jalour Singh & Ors. (Supra) held that the award made by a Lok Adalat based on settlement can be challenged by filing a petition under Article 226 and/or Article 227 of the Constitution of India on limited ground. In the given facts of that case, the Apex Court found that the Lok Adalat had exercised a power or jurisdiction which was not vested in it, since no compromise or settlement was arrived at by the parties concerned and which was duly signed as a token of acceptance. In the present case, it cannot be said that the Lok Adalat had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised the powers not vested in it, since an agreement/settlement was mutually arrived at and signed by the parties concerned. Therefore, I do not find this decision to be applicable to the case of the petitioners. [16.]           Having come to the above findings, I do not find the necessity to enter into the other technical issues raised by the learned senior counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 & 2. In the result, I do not find merit in the writ petition and the same is dismissed. WP(C) No. 86 of 2019                                          10 | P a g e [17.]          Before parting with the records, I find it necessary to provide herein that as there is no dispute to the fact that the petitioners are residing in the main house situated over LSC No. 145 of 1977, from the time their father late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma was alive, they should be allowed to reside peacefully in the main house as long as they want to. [18.]          Office  to  send   back   the   Lower   Court   Records
2.    The two money suits filed by her having been dismissed by the trial Court, but decreed by the First Appellate Court and the decrees so passed by the First Appellate Court having been reversed by the High Court in two second appeals, the plaintiff­ appellant is back to square one and is before us in the above 3.    We have heard Shri Rajiv Bhalla, learned counsel for the appellant and Shri Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior counsel for the 4.    The appellant herein filed two suits in Civil Suits No.15643 and 15592 of 2007 against the respondents herein, on the file of the Court of the Civil Judge (Junior Division), Chandigarh, for recovery of (i) a sum of Rs.10,48,000/­ in the first suit; and (ii) a sum of Rs.67,31,000/­ in the second suit. The averments in the first suit were as follows: (i) that the second respondent herein is the sister of the appellant’s husband; (ii) that the first respondent is the husband and the third respondent herein is the son of respondent No.2; (iii) that the respondents herein (defendants in the suit) were carrying on the business of dealing in building materials under the name and style of Prem Chand Amar Chand; (iv) that the appellant and her son are having a joint account in ICICI Bank, Sector­9, Chandigarh, where the respondents also maintain an account; (v) that the respondents borrowed a sum of Rs.10,50,000/­from the appellant on 18.11.2003, by way of a cheque; (vi) that though the respondents refunded a sum of Rs.5,00,000/­ on 7.08.2006, promising to repay the balance within six months, they failed to honour the commitment; (vii) that, therefore,  the   respondents    were   liable to   pay a   sum   of Rs.5,50,000/­towards principal and a sum of Rs.4,98,000/­ towards interest, thus, totaling to Rs.10,48,000/­. 5.   The averments in the second suit in brief were as follows: (i) that in the year 2001­2002, respondent No.1 lured the plaintiff and her husband to join him in his real estate business: (ii) that since the appellant and her family were residing in Kurukshetra and the respondents were living in Chandigarh, the respondent No.1 got the signature of the appellant in some blank papers, on the ground that it was not possible to shuttle every time between these two places, whenever a transaction was to be completed; (iii) that the appellant and her son were having account in the same branch of the same bank in which respondent Nos.1 and 2 were also having account; (iv) that with a view to make available necessary funds, for the use of respondent No.1 in real estate dealings, the appellant and her son kept substantial amounts to their credit in their bank account; (v) that in March, 2006 the appellant and her husband were shocked to find that substantial amounts totaling to Rs.54,50,000/­ had been withdrawn from their account on different dates by the respondents; (vi) that on her request, the bank officers produced the records, which disclosed that a cheque dated 30.12.2005 for a sum of Rs.25,00,000/­, signed by respondent No.3 by forging the signature of the plaintiff had been encashed, apart from the withdrawal of a sum of Rs.9,50,000/­ on 9.05.2005 and the transfer of another sum of Rs.20,00,000/­ purportedly on the written request of the appellant on 27.8.2005; (vii) that the withdrawals/ transfer of these amounts were not authorized by the appellant, but had been done by misusing the signatures obtained from the appellant; (viii) that after finding out these facts, the appellant lodged a complaint in FIR No.195 on 14.12.2006 against the respondents for the offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 read with Section 120­B of the Indian Penal Code; (ix) that the respondents were granted anticipatory bail in the criminal case, upon their furnishing bank guarantee for a sum of Rs.50,00,000/­ and (x) that the amounts withdrawn by/transferred to the account of the defendants, together with interest @ 12% per annum worked out to Rs.67,31,000/­ and (xi) that therefore they were filing the suit for recovery of the said amount. 6.   The case of the respondents in the first suit for recovery of Rs.10,48,000/­ was: (i) that they never borrowed any money from the appellant; (ii) that the amount received by them under the cheque dated 18.11.2003 was for the purpose of investment in a property, which was part of the real estate business; (iii) that the payment of Rs.5,00,000/­ made by them on 7.08.2006 was in full and final settlement of the claim, after a compromise was arrived at the intervention of three persons by name Satish Kumar, Prem Raj Aggarwal and O.P. Gupta; and (iv) that since there was no borrowing, the question of payment of interest does not arise and that the suit was liable to be dismissed. 7.    In their written statement of the second suit, it was contended by the respondents: (i) that the appellant and the respondents started doing real estate business jointly from the year 2001­2002; (ii) that they purchased and sold many properties and shared the profits; (iii) that the respondents never got the signatures of the appellant in blank papers; (iv) that the amounts represented by the cheques dated 9.05.2005, 27.08.2005 and 30.12.2005 were towards the investment made by the appellant and her son in the real estate business; (v) that the appellant issued confirmation letters to the bank, which showed that the payments under those cheques were authorized payments; (vi) that the appellant’s son actually gave an affidavit both on his behalf and on behalf of the appellant; (vii) that in the said affidavit, it was admitted by the appellant’s son that out of the amounts paid under the three cheques, a sum of Rs.30,00,000/­ was given, out of love and affection; (vii) that the appellant filed a false complaint, as though the respondents cheated her and withdrawn money by forging the signatures; (viii) that in view of the allegations against the bank, the appellant ought to have impleaded the bank as a party to the suit and (ix) that no money is due and payable by the respondents to the appellant. 8.    Before the trial Court, the appellant examined her husband as PW­1 and examined herself as PW­2. The first respondent examined himself as DW­1 and he examined as DWs 2 and 3, the third party mediators, in the presence of whom a settlement was purportedly arrived at. The respondents marked a photocopy of the letter addressed to the Manager of the bank bearing the signature of the appellant as Exhibit D­1. They also filed the confirmation letter dated 2.01.2006 as Exhibit D­2 and the affidavit purportedly signed by the appellant’s son both on his behalf and on behalf of the appellant, as Exhibit D­3. 9.    By a judgment and decree dated 23.01.2013, the trial Court dismissed the first suit on the ground that the appellant­plaintiff failed to establish the advancement of the loan and that her failure to examine her son, who was the joint account holder, as a witness in the suit, was fatal. The trial Court also held the suit was not within the period of limitation. 10. By a separate Judgment and decree dated 22.07.2013, the trial Court dismissed the second suit on the ground that the parties were in real estate business and that the payment of Rs.5,00,000/­ in full and final settlement on 7.08.2006, stood proved by the version of third party mediators examined as DW­2 and DW­3. The Court also held that the appellant failed to establish fraud on the part of the respondents. 11. The district Judge, Chandigarh by two separate Judgments dated 18.03.2015, allowed the first appeals filed by the appellant in Civil Appeal Nos.903 and 1056 of 2013 and granted a decree in the first suit for recovery of Rs.5,50,000/­ together with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the due date till the date of decree and interest @ 6% per annum from the date of the decree till realization. In the second suit, the trial court granted a decree for recovery of Rs.54,50,000/­ together with interest @ 7.5 % per annum till the date of the decree and @ 6% per annum from the date of the decree till realisation. 12.     The respondents filed two second appeals in RSA Nos.6134 of 2015 and 130 of 2016. Both the second appeals were allowed by the High Court by a Judgment and decree dated 20.03.2018 resulting in the dismissal of the 2 money suits filed by the appellant. Not stopping with the mere allowing of the appeals, the High Court went a step further by directing the appellant to refund the amount of Rs.55,00,000/­ paid by the respondents, by virtue of the order passed in the anticipatory bail application, together with interest @ 7% per annum. It is against the said common judgment that the plaintiff­appellant has come up with the above appeals. 13. The Contention of the Shri Rajiv Bhalla, learned counsel for the appellant is that the trial Court as well as the High Court went completely on a wrong track by accepting the plea of full and final settlement set up by the respondents and that the High Court went overboard in passing an order for refund of money paid in the proceedings for grant of anticipatory bail. 14. Per contra, it is contended by Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior counsel for the respondent that the failure of the appellant to implead her son as a co­plaintiff or atleast to examine him as a witness, coupled with her own admissions as PW­2, falsified her case. Once it was found that the payments to the respondents were authorized and once it was established through third party mediators that there was a settlement, the appellant­plaintiff was bound to fail and that therefore, the judgment of the High Court does not warrant any interference. 15. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and have also gone through the pleadings, evidence and the Judgments of all the three Courts. 16. As we have seen earlier, the first suit was for recovery of a sum of Rs.5,50,000/­, which remained unrefunded, out of the amount of Rs.10,50,000/­ allegedly paid by way of loan. The receipt of Rs.10,50,000/­ by way of cheque No.459745 dated 18.11.2003 was admitted   by  the  respondents.     Similarly  the   re­payment     of Rs.5,00,000/­ by the respondents to the plaintiff­appellant         on 7.08.2006 is admitted by the appellant. The only defence set up by the respondents was that the payment of Rs.5,00,000/­ made by them on 7.08.2006 was by way of full and final settlement. To show that there was a full and final settlement, the respondents examined two third party mediators. But no receipt was taken by the   respondents    from    the appellant    that   the  payment    of Rs.5,00,000/­ on 7.08.2006 was in full and final settlement. There was also no written memorandum of compromise/settlement. When payment of a certain amount of money and the repayment of only a portion of the same are admitted, the party pleading that such a part repayment was in full and final settlement, has a huge burden cast upon him to show that there was a settlement. Oral evidence of the so called third party mediators, is not sufficient to establish full and final settlement, in cases of this nature, where all transactions have happened only through banking channels and the defendants claimed that there were business transactions. It is unbelievable that the respondents, who reached such a settlement, failed to have the same recorded in black and white, either in the form of a memo or in the form of a receipt. 17. Interestingly, Exhibit D­3 filed by the respondents is an affidavit purportedly signed and verified by the appellant’s son on 8.03.2006, both on his behalf and on behalf of his mother (the appellant), agreeing to treat a sum of Rs.30,00,000/­ paid by the appellant, as a payment made out of love and affection. If, on 8.03.2006, the appellant and her son were gracious enough to treat a huge amount of Rs.30,00,000/­ as one made out of love and affection, there could have been no occasion for a dispute requiring mediation at the intervention of third parties, on 7.8.2006, resulting in the payment of Rs.5,00,000/­ by the respondents to the appellant in full and final settlement. Unfortunately, all the three Courts failed to juxtapose these two events which happened in an interval of five months, to see through the game. 18. In simple terms, the case of the appellant­plaintiff in the first suit was one of lending and non­payment. The defence set up by the respondents was one of payment of a lesser amount (than the original amount), in full and final settlement. A party who admits receipt of certain amount of money on a particular date and pleads discharge by way of a full and final settlement at a latter date, is the one on whom the onus lies. This onus was not discharged by the respondents in the first suit and, hence, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed in the first suit. The High Court completely overlooked this aspect. 19. Coming to the second suit, the case of the appellant­plaintiff was that various amounts of money were either withdrawn from or transferred out of their accounts, by the defendants unauthorisedly and that the amounts so taken away totaled to Rs.54,50,000/­. The defence of the respondents was that the amounts represented authorized payments for the purchase and sale of properties in a real estate business and that out of those amounts, a sum of Rs.30,00,000/­ was treated as a payment made out of love and 20. Let    us  assume     for a    moment    that the  amount    of Rs.54,50,000/­ either withdrawn or transferred from out of the account of the appellant by the respondents represented authorized payments, made by the appellant towards investment in real estate business. In such a case, the respondents are obliged to produce the accounts of the real estate business and show how those amounts were accounted for. The respondents could not produce any books of account. Therefore, the respondents thought it convenient to claim that all those amounts were investments in a real estate business and that a portion of it was agreed to be treated as a gratuitous payment. Investments in business dealings and gratuitous payments do not normally go together. As in the first case, the flow of money from the account of the appellant­ plaintiff into the respondents’ account is admitted. While the appellant­plaintiff termed such a flow of money as unauthorized withdrawal /transfer, the respondents claimed the same to be part of investment in real estate business. In the light of such a defence, the onus, even in the second suit, was on the defence to show that there were business dealings and that the amount stood completely accounted for. No books of accounts were produced by the defence to show that the amounts that flowed out of the plaintiff’s bank account were absorbed and accounted for within business. 21. Exhibit D­3 affidavit is a very curious document whose admissibility itself is questionable. It starts with a solemn affirmation reading “We Anita Rani,…. and Sulabh Singla… do hereby solemnly affirm and declare as under”. But it is signed only by Singla. According to this affidavit, sworn on 8.03.2006, the appellant­plaintiff and her son had given Rs.30,00,000/­ to the respondents out of love and affection. The affidavit goes further to say that there was no transaction between the deponents and the respondents. This affirmation allegedly made on 8.03.2006 that there was no transaction between them, stands in contrast to the claim of full and final settlement made on 7.08.2006. 22. In a suit for recovery of money, a defendant admitting the receipt of money but pleading that the same was a gratuitous payment, is obliged to prove that it was a gratuitous payment. As a matter of fact Exhibit D­3 affidavit dated 8.03.2006 does not use the expression “gratuitous payment”, but uses the expression “love and affection”. But this affidavit also states that there was no transaction between the deponents and the respondents. Thus while placing reliance upon this affidavit, the defendants actually pleaded a mutually contradictory case, as reflected in paragraph 8 of the written statement which reads as follows: “It is added that from the aforesaid amount, a sum of Rs. 30.00 lacs was given by the plaintiff to the defendants out of love and affection being near relations and there was no transaction between plaintiff and defendants to that effect. Suit for recovery of the amount against the defendant by the plaintiffs is not maintainable as the defendants are under no legal obligation to pay back the amount to the plaintiff. The defendants never borrowed the amount nor are under any obligation to pay back the amount to the plaintiff. Copy of the affidavit is attached herewith. Subsequently, the defendants had settled their accounts pertaining to sale purchase of properties jointly as well as other properties purchased in order to run property dealer business and a sum of Rs. 5.00 lacs was paid to the plaintiff on 7.8.2006 in full and final settlement of her claim through cheque dated 7.8.2006 and the said cheque has been encashed by the plaintiff. The said compromise was got arrived at by the intervention of Shri Shri Dev Raj Aggarwal and Shri O.P. Gupta S/o Shri Raghu Nath Gupta. The plaintiff accepted the said cheque of a sum of Rs. 5.00 lacs in adjustment/settlement of all the accounts with regard to the amounts taken in satisfaction of her claim fully and finally. 23. If as per the above pleadings and Ex. D­3, there was no transaction, but a huge amount of Rs.30,00,000/­ was treated on 8.03.2006 as a gratuitous payment, there was no occasion for the settlement of any accounts on 7.08.2006 resulting in a full and final settlement of the claim. 24. If the parties have had business dealings from the year 2001­ 2002, it is hard to believe that a part of the amounts that flowed out of the account of the plaintiff, was out of love and affection. The only piece of evidence on the basis of which the gratuitous nature of payment is sought to be proved is Exhibit D­3, but it does not contain the signature of the appellant. Therefore, the plea of gratuitous payment is unbelievable and was not established by the 25. Once the plea of gratuitous payment falls to the ground, Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 will come into play. “70. Obligation of person enjoying benefit of non­ gratuitous act.­ Where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or delivers anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitously, and such other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered.” 26. As held by this Court in the State of West Bengal vs. B.K. Mondal & Sons1, Section 70 is based on the premise that something was done by one party for another and that the work so done voluntarily, was accepted by the other. Therefore, as a corollary, the plea that there was a subsisting contract in the nature of business transactions, is antithetic to the very essence of section 70. This is why section 70 forms part of Chapter V of the Indian Contract Act, which is titled as “Of certain relations resembling those created by contract”. 27. As pointed out earlier, the respondents have admitted that the moneys as claimed by the appellant­plaintiff were either paid by the plaintiff or flown out of the plaintiff’s account into their own account. Therefore, the onus was actually on the respondents to prove either a discharge by way of settlement of accounts or the gratuitous nature of the payment. The respondents miserably failed to discharge the onus of proof so cast upon them. Hence, the plaintiff­appellant is entitled to a decree despite a few discrepancies in her evidence, especially when the discrepancies have no bearing upon the payment/flow of monies from the plaintiff to the 28. In view of the above, the appeals are allowed. The Judgment and decrees of the High Court are set aside and the Judgment and decrees of the First Appellate Court are restored. In other words, there will be a decree in both the suits, as per the Judgment of the District Court, Chandigarh dated 18.03.2015 in Civil Appeal Nos.903 and 1056 of 2013. The appellant will be entitled to costs in these appeals which we quantify at Rs.50,000/­.            The amount deposited by the appellant pursuant to the Order passed by this Court on 18.05.2018 and deposited in an interest bearing fixed deposit pursuant to the Order passed by this Court on 14.12.2018 shall be released by the Registry to the appellant together with the accrued interest.
2.        The reference made to this Constitution Bench relates to the grant of time for filing response to a complaint under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short ‘the Act’). The first question referred is as to whether Section 13(2) (a) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides for the respondent/opposite party filing its response to the complaint within 30 days or such extended period, not exceeding 15 days, should be read as mandatory or directory; i.e., whether the District Forum has power to extend the time for filing the response beyond the period of 15 days, in addition to 30 days. The second question which is referred is as to what would be the commencing point of limitation of 30 days stipulated under the aforesaid Section. 3.         The first question was referred by a two judge Bench of this Court vide an Order dated 11.02.2016 passed in Civil Appeal No(s).1083­1084     of   2016,     M/s    Bhasin     Infotech and Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. versus M/s Grand Venezia Buyers Association (Reg), the relevant portion of which is as under: “There is an apparent conflict between the decisions of this Court in Topline Shoes Limited vs. Association Vs. Union of India [(2005) 6 SCC 344] on the one hand and J.J. Merchant & Ors. Vs. 635 and NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage [2014 AIOL 4615] on the other in so far as the power of the Courts to extend time for filing of written     statement/reply     to   a complaint is concerned. The earlier mentioned line of decisions take the view that the relevant provisions including those of Order 8 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 are directory in nature and the Courts concerned have the power to extend time for filing the written statement. The second line of decisions which are also of coordinate Benches however takes a contrary view and hold that when it comes to power of the Consumer Fora to extend the time for filing a reply there is no such power. Since the question that falls for determination here often arises before the Consumer Fora and Commissions all over the country it will be more appropriate if the conflict    is   resolved    by     an authoritative    judgment.     Further since the conflict is between Benches comprising three Judges we deem it fit to refer these appeals to a five­Judge Bench to resolve the conflict once and for all. While we do so we are mindful of the fact that in the ordinary course a two­Judge Bench ought to make a reference to a three­Judge Bench in the first place but in the facts and keeping in view the fact that the conflict is between coordinate Benches comprising three Judges a reference to three Judges may not suffice.” 4.         The other question has been referred by another Division Bench of this Court by an Order dated 18.01.2017 passed in this very appeal being Civil Appeal No(s).10941­10942 of 2013, NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd, the relevant portion of the judgment is as under: “……….what is the commencing point of the limitation of 30 days stipulated in Section 13 of the Act is required      to      be      decided authoritatively.   The     declaration made in JJ Merchant’s case that the said period is to be reckoned from the date of the receipt of the notice by the opposite party or complaint under the Act requires in our humble opinion, a more critical analysis.” 5.         We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties at length and have carefully gone through the records. 6.         In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer Protection Act, in paragraph 4, it has been specifically provided that the Consumer Protection Act is “To provide speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes, a quasi­judicial machinery is sought to be set up at the district, State and Central levels…….”. The Preamble of the Consumer Protection Act also mentions that the Act is “to provide for better protection of the interests of the consumers”.     The nomenclature of this Act also goes to show that it is for the benefit or protection of the consumer. From the above, it is evident that the Consumer Protection Act has been enacted to provide for expeditious disposal of consumer disputes and that, it is for the protection and benefit of the consumer. 7.        Before we proceed to analyse and determine the questions referred, we may, for ready reference, reproduce the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and its (1) The District Forum shall, on admission of a complaint, if it relates to any goods,­ (a) refer a copy of the admitted complaint, within twenty­one days from the date of its admission to the opposite party mentioned in the complaint directing him to give his version of the case within a period of thirty days or such extended period not exceeding fifteen days as may be granted by the District (2) The District Forum shall, if the complaints admitted by it under section 12 relates to goods in respect of which the procedure specified in sub­section (1) cannot be followed, or if the complaint relates to any services,­ complaint to the opposite party directing him to give his version of the case within a period of (b) where the opposite party, on receipt of a copy of the complaint, referred to him under clause (a) denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or omits or fails to take any action to represent his case within the time given by the District Forum, the District Forum shall proceed to settle consumer dispute,­ party, where the opposite party denies or disputes the allegations contained in the complaint, or (ii)    ex parte on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the complainant where the opposite party omits or fails to take any action to represent his case within the time given by the Forum; (c) where the complainant fails to appear on the date of hearing before the District Forum, the District Forum may either dismiss the complaint for default or decide it on merits. with the procedure laid down in subsections (1) and (2) shall be called in question in any court on     the      ground        that    the principles of natural justice have not been complied with. [(3A) Every complaint shall be heard as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to decide the complaint within a period of three months from the date of receipt of notice by opposite party where the complaint does not require analysis          or       testing     of months, if it requires analysis or testing of commodities: shall be ordinarily granted by the District Forum unless sufficient cause is shown and the reasons for grant of adjournment have been recorded in writing by the Forum: Provided further that the District Forum shall make such orders as to the costs occasioned by the adjournment as may be provided in the regulations made under this Act. disposed of after the period so specified, the District Forum shall 1 Ins. by Act 62 of 2002, sec. 9 (w.e.f. 15­3­2003). record in writing, the reasons for the same at the time of disposing of the said complaint.] [(3B) Where during the pendency of any proceeding before the District Forum, it appears to it necessary, it may pass such interim order as is just and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.] (4) For the purposes of this section, the District Forum shall have the same powers as are vested in a civil court under Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) while trying a suit in respect of the enforcing the attendance of any defendant        or       witness and examining the witness on oath; (ii)    the discovery and production of any document or other material object producible as evidence; (iii)   the reception of evidence on (iv)    the requisitioning of the report of the concerned analysis or test from the appropriate laboratory or from any other relevant source; (v)     issuing of any commission for the examination of any witness, (vi)    any other matter which may be prescribed. 2 Ins. by Act 62 of 2002, Sec. 9 (w.e.f. 15­3­2003). person aggrieved by an order made by the District Forum may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order, in such form and manner as may be prescribed: said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period; terms of an order of the District Forum, shall be entertained by the State Commission unless the appellant has deposited in the prescribed manner fifty per cent. of that     amount    or    twenty­five thousand rupees, whichever is person aggrieved by an order made by the State Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub­clause (i) of clause (a) of section 17 may prefer an appeal against such order to the National Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order in such form and manner as may be prescribed: said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period: Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited in the prescribed manner fifty per cent. of the amount or rupees thirty­five thousand, whichever is less. Section­24A. Limitation period. (1) The District Forum, the State Commission      or     the    National complaint unless it is filed within two years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen. (2) Notwithstanding        anything contained in sub­section (1), a complaint may be entertained be, that he had sufficient cause for not filing the complaint complaint shall be entertained unless the National Commission, the State Commission or the District Forum, as the case may be, records its reasons for condoning such delay.” Relevant Provisions of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005 are reproduced below: “Reg.­10. Issue of notice.­(1) Whenever the Consumer Forum directs the issuance of a notice in respect of a complaint, appeal or revision petition, as the case may be,        to      the      opposite ordinarily such notice shall be issued for a period of 30 days raising presumption of service, 30 days notice shall be required. (3) Whenever notices are sought to be effected by a courier service, it shall be ascertained that the courier for the purpose of effecting service, security deposit may also be taken. (6)   After the opposite party or respondent has put in appearance, no application or document shall be received by the Registrar unless it bears an endorsement that a copy thereof has been served upon the other side.” (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 15, 19 and 24A, the period of limitation in the following matters shall be as follows:­ (i)    Revision Petition shall be filed within 90 days from the date of the order or the date of receipt of the order as the case may be; (ii)   Application for setting aside the ex parte order under section 22A or dismissal of the complaint in default shall be maintainable if filed within thirty days from the date of the order or date of receipt of the order, as the case may be; (iii)  An application for review under sub­section (2) of section 22 shall be filed to the National Commission within 30 days from the date of the order or receipt of the order, as the case may be; (iv)   The period of limitation for filing any application for which no period of limitation has been specified in the Act, the rules of these regulations shall be thirty days from the date of the cause of action or the date of knowledge. (2) Subject to the       provisions (1) In all proceedings before the Consumer Forum, endeavour shall be made by the parties and their counsel to avoid the use of of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 may be applied which have been referred to in the Act or in the rules made thereunder. Question No. 1:       Whether the District Forum has power to extend the time for filing of response to the complaint beyond the period of 15 days, in addition to 30 days, as envisaged under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer 8.         A bare reading of Section 13(2)(a) of the Act makes it clear that the copy of the complaint which is to be sent to the opposite party, is to be with the direction to give his version of (or response to) the case (or complaint) within a period of 30 days. It further provides that such period of 30 days can be extended by the District Forum, but not beyond 15 days. 9.         Sub­Section 2(b)(i) of Section 13 of the Act provides for a complaint to be decided on the basis of the response by the opposite party and the evidence of the complainant and the opposite party, where allegations contained in the complaint are denied or disputed by the opposite party. Sub­Section 2(b)(ii) of Section 13 of the Act provides that where no response is filed by the opposite party, the complaint may be decided ex parte on the basis of evidence brought forth by the complainant. 10.        Sub­Section 2(c) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act further provides that where the complainant fails to appear on the date of hearing before the District Forum, the District Forum may either dismiss the complaint for default or decide it on merits. The aforesaid provision [sub­Section 2(c)] was inserted by Act 62 of 2002, w.e.f. 15.03.2003. Similarly, Section (3A) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, which was also inserted by Act 62 of 2002, provides for deciding every complaint as expeditiously as possible and endeavour       shall be made to decide the complaint within a period of three months from the receipt of notice by the opposite party, and within five months, if the complaint requires analysis or testing of commodities. It also provides that no adjournment shall ordinarily be granted by the District Forum, and if the same is to be granted, costs may be imposed, and further that reasons be recorded if the complaint is disposed of after the time so provided. 11.        From the above, it is clear that as mentioned in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer Protection Act, the District Forum is to provide speedy disposal of consumer disputes. The same has been further reiterated by the legislature by insertion of Section 13(2)(c) and 13(3A) by Act 62 of 2002. 12.        Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act clearly contemplates where time can be extended by the District Forum, and where it is not to be extended. Like, under sub­Section (3A) of Section 13, despite the best efforts of the District Forum, in situations where the complaint cannot be decided within the period specified therein, the same can be decided beyond the specified period for reasons to be recorded in writing by the District Forum at the time of disposing of the complaint. Meaning thereby that the same would not be mandatory, but only directory.  The phrase “endeavour shall be made”, makes the intention of the legislature evident that the District Forum is to make every effort to decide the case expeditiously within time, but the same can also be decided beyond the said period, but for reasons to be recorded. 13.        On the contrary, sub­Section (2)(a) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for the opposite party to give his response ‘within a period of 30 days or such extended period not exceeding 15 days as may be granted by the District Forum’. The intention of the legislature seems to be very clear that the opposite party would get the time of 30 days, and in addition another 15 days at the discretion of the Forum to file its response. No further discretion of granting time beyond 45 days is intended under the Act. The question of natural justice is dealt with by the legislature in sub­Section (3) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, which clearly provides that “No proceedings complying with the procedure laid down in the sub­Section (1) and (2) shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the principles of natural justice have not been complied with.”     The legislature was conscious that the complaint would result in being decided ex parte, or without the response of the opposite party, if not filed within such time as provided under the Consumer Protection Act, and in such a case, the opposite party will not be allowed to take the plea that he was not given sufficient time or that principles of natural justice were not complied with.     Any other interpretation would defeat the very purpose of sub­Section (3) of Section 13 of the Consumer 14.        The maximum period of 45 days, as provided under the Consumer Protection Act, would not mean that the complainant has a right to always avail such maximum period of 45 days to file its response.    Regulation 10 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005 clearly provides that ordinarily such notice to the opposite party to file its response shall be issued for a period of 30 days, but the same can be even less than 30 days, depending upon the circumstances of each case. 15.         Now, reverting back to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act to consider as to whether the provision of sub­ Section 2(a) of Section 13 granting a maximum period of 15 days in addition to 30 days has to be read as mandatory or not, we may also consider the other provisions of the Consumer Protection Act where the legislature intended to allow extension of period of limitation. Section 15 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for filing of an appeal from the order of the District Forum to the State Commission within a period of 30 days.         However, it leaves a discretion with the State Commission to entertain an appeal filed after the expiry of the said period of 30 days, if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within the stipulated period. Similarly, discretion for filing an appeal before the National Commission beyond the period of 30 days has also been provided under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act. Section 24A provides for the limitation period of 2 years for filing the complaint.     However, sub­Section (2) of Section 24A gives a discretion to entertain a complaint even after the period of 2 years, if there is a satisfactory cause for not filing the complaint within such period, which has to be recorded in writing. 16.         Regulation 14 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005 also deals with limitation. In addition, the same provides for limitation while dealing with appeals (under Section 15 and 19) and complaint (under Section 24A).            Sub­Regulation (2) of Regulation 14 provides for condonation of delay for sufficient reasons to be recorded. 17.         The legislature in its wisdom has provided for filing of complaint or appeals beyond the period specified under the relevant provisions of the Act and Regulations, if there is sufficient cause given by the party, which has to be to the satisfaction of the concerned authority. No such discretion has been provided for under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act for filing a response to the complaint beyond the extended period of 45 days (30 days plus 15 days).            Had the legislature not wanted to make such provision mandatory but only directory, the provision for further extension of the period for filing the response beyond 45 days would have been provided, as has been provided for in the cases of filing of complaint and appeals. To carve out an exception in a specific provision of the statute is not within the jurisdiction of the Courts, and if it is so done, it would amount to legislating or inserting a provision into the statute, which is not permissible. By specifically enacting a provision under sub­Section (3) of Section 13, with a specific clarification that violation of the principles of natural justice shall not be called in question where the procedure prescribed under sub­Sections (1) and (2) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act has been followed or complied with, the intention of the legislature is clear that mere denial of further extension of time for filing the response (by the opposite party) would not amount to denial or violation of the principles of natural justice. This provision of Section 13(3) reinforces the time limit specified in Section 13(2)(a) of the Act. 18.         This Court in the case of Lachmi Narain vs Union of India (1976) 2 SCC 953 has held that “if the provision is couched in prohibitive or negative language, it can rarely be directory, the use of peremptory language in a negative form is per se indicative of the interest that the provision is to be mandatory”.       Further, hardship cannot be a ground for changing the mandatory nature of the statute, as has been held by this Court in Bhikraj Jaipurai vs Union of India AIR 1962 SC 113=(1962) 2 SCR 880 472. Hardship cannot thus be a ground to interpret the provision so as to enlarge the time, where the statute provides for a specific time, which, in our opinion, has to be complied in letter and This Court, in the case of Rohitash Kumar vs Om Prakash Sharma (2013) 11 SCC 451 has, in paragraph 23, held “23. There may be a statutory provision, which causes great hardship or inconvenience to either the party concerned, or to an individual, but the Court has no choice but to enforce it in full rigor. It is a well settled principle of interpretation that hardship or inconvenience caused, cannot be used as a basis to alter the meaning of the language employed by the legislature, if such meaning is clear upon a bare perusal of the statute. If the language is plain and hence allows only one meaning, the same has to be given effect to, even if it causes hardship or possible injustice.” While concluding, it was observed “that the hardship caused to an individual, cannot be a ground for not giving effective and grammatical meaning to every word of the provision, if the language used therein, is unequivocal.” Further, it has been held by this Court in the case of Popat Bahiru Govardhane vs Special Land Acquisition Officer (2013) 10 SCC 765 that the law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its vigour when the statute so prescribes and that the Court has no power to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds, even if the statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party. 19.        The   contention    of  the   learned  Counsel     for  the respondent is that by not leaving a discretion with the District Forum for extending the period of limitation for filing the response before it by the opposite party, grave injustice would be caused as there could be circumstances beyond the control of the opposite party because of which the opposite party may not be able to file the response within the period of 30 days or the extended period of 15 days. In our view, if the law so provides, the same has to be strictly complied, so as to achieve the object of the statute.   It is well settled that law prevails over equity, as equity can only supplement the law, and not supplant it. This Court, in the case of Laxminarayan R. Bhattad vs State of Maharashtra (2003) 5 SCC 413, has observed that “when there is a conflict between law and equity the former shall prevail.” In P.M. Latha vs State of Kerala (2003) 3 SCC 541, this Court held that “Equity and law are twin brothers and law should be applied and interpreted equitably, but equity cannot override written or settled law.”    In Nasiruddin vs Sita Ram Agarwal (2003) 2 SCC 577, this Court observed that “in a case where the statutory provision is plain and unambiguous, the court shall not interpret the same in a different manner, only because of harsh consequences arising therefrom.”       In E. Palanisamy vs Palanisamy (2003) 1 SCC 123, it was held that “Equitable considerations have no place where the statute contained express provisions.”   Further, in   India House vs Kishan N. Lalwani (2003) 9 SCC 393, this Court held that “The period of limitation statutorily prescribed has to be strictly adhered to and cannot be relaxed or departed from by equitable considerations.” It is thus settled law that where the provision of the Act is clear and unambiguous, it has no scope for any interpretation on equitable ground. 20.        It is true that ‘justice hurried is justice buried’. But in the same breath it is also said that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’. The legislature has chosen the latter, and for a good reason. It goes with the objective sought to be achieved by the Consumer Protection Act, which is to provide speedy justice to the consumer. It is not that sufficient time to file a response to the complaint has been denied to the opposite party. It is just that discretion of extension of time beyond 15 days (after the 30 days period) has been curtailed and consequences for the same have been provided under Section 13(2)(b)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act. It may be that in some cases the opposite party could face hardship because of such provision, yet for achieving the object of the Act, which is speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes, hardship which may be caused to a party has to be ignored. 21.        It has been further contended that the language of Section 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act is pari materia to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short ‘the Code’) and if time can be extended for filing of written submission in a suit under the aforesaid provision of the Code, the same would apply to the filing of response to complaint under the Consumer Protection Act as well, and hence the provision of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act would be directory and not mandatory. In this regard, what is noteworthy is that Regulation 26 of the Consumer Protection Regulation, 2005, clearly mandates that endeavour is to be made to avoid the use of the provisions of the Code except for such provisions, which have been referred to in the Consumer Protection Act and the Regulations framed thereunder, which is provided for in respect of specific matters enumerated in Section 13(4) of the Consumer Protection Act. It is pertinent to note that non­filing of written statement under Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code is not followed by any consequence of such non­filing within the time so provided in the Code. Now, while considering the relevant provisions of the Code, it is noteworthy that Order VIII Rule 1 read with Order VIII Rule 10 prescribes that the maximum period of 120 days provided under Order VIII Rule 1 is actually not meant to be mandatory, but only directory. Order VIII Rule 10 mandates that where written statement is not filed within the time provided under Order VIII Rule 1 “the court shall pronounce the judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit”.  A harmonious construction of these provisions is clearly indicative of the fact that the discretion is left with the Court to grant time beyond the maximum period of 120 days, which may be in exceptional cases. On the other hand, sub­Section (2)(b)(ii) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act clearly provides for the consequence of the complaint to be proceeded ex parte against the opposite party, if the opposite party omits or fails to represent his case within the time given. It may further be noted that in Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code, for suits filed under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, a proviso has been inserted for ‘commercial disputes of a specified value’ (vide Act 4 of 2016 w.r.e.f. 23.10.2015), which reads as “Provided further that no Court shall make an Order to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this Order for filing the written From the above, it is clear that for commercial suits, time for filing written statement provided under Order VIII Rule 1 is meant to be mandatory, but not so for ordinary civil suits. Similarly, in our considered view, for cases under the Consumer Protection Act also, the time provided under Section 13(2)(a) of the Act has to be read as mandatory, and not directory. Once consequences are provided for not filing the response to the complaint within the time specified, and it is further provided that proceedings complying with the procedure laid down under sub Section (1) and (2) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act shall not be called in question in any Court on the ground that the principles of natural justice have not been complied with, the intention of the legislature is absolutely clear that the provision of sub­Section 2(a) of Section 13 of the Act in specifying the time limit for filing the response to the complaint is mandatory, and not directory. 22.         After noticing that there were delays in deciding the complaints by the District Forum, the legislature inserted sub­ Section (3A) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act providing for a time limit for deciding the complaints. From this it is amply clear that the intention of the legislature was, and has always been, for expeditious disposal of the complaints.          By providing for extension of time for disposal of the cases filed, for reasons to be recorded,        the legislature has provided for a discretion to the Forum that wherever necessary, the extension of the time can be provided for, and where such further extension is not to be granted [as in the case of Section 13(2)(a)],         the legislature has consciously not provided for the same, so as to achieve the object of the Act. 23.        In SCG Contracts (India) Private Limited vs K.S. 210, this Court, was dealing with a case relating to the filing of written statement under the Code, in respect of a case under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. After noticing the amendments brought in Order V Rule 1, Order VIII Rule 1 and Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code with regard to ‘commercial disputes of specified value’ under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 by way of insertion of the Provisos in the aforesaid provisions, this Court held that “….the clear, definite and mandatory provisions of Order V read with Order VIII Rule 1 and 10 cannot be circumvented by recourse to the inherent power under Section 151 to do the opposite of what is stated therein”. It was, thus, held that there was no scope for enlarging the time for filing of written statement beyond the period of 120 days in commercial suits, as the provision with regard to such suits would be mandatory, and not directory. The said judgment has been affirmed by a Bench of three Judges in Desh Raj vs Balkishan decided on 20.01.2020 in Civil Appeal No.433 of 2020. (2004) 11 SCC 472, this Court was dealing with the provisions of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992, and the question was whether the Special Court has power to condone the delay in filing the petition under Section 4(2) of the said Act.        While holding, that the said provision would be mandatory, it was held in paragraph 13 as “13. It is not for the courts to determine whether the period of 30 days is too short to take into account the various misfortunes that may be faced by notified persons who wish to file objections under Section 4(2) of the Act nor can the section be held to be directory because of such alleged inadequacy of time.” Then, after considering the decisions of this Court in Topline Shoes Ltd. vs. Corporation Bank (2002) 6 SCC 33 and Dr. J. J. Merchant vs. Shrinath Chaturvedi (2002) 6 SCC 635, this Court held that “the period for filing an objection in Section 4(2) in the Act is a mandatory provision given the language of the Section and having regard to the objects sought to be served by the Act.” 25.        Certain other cases, which have been referred to by the learned Counsel for the parties, have, in our considered opinion, no direct bearing on the facts and issue involved in the present case relating to the Consumer Protection Act, and thus, the same are not being dealt with and considered here. 26.        We may now deal with the decisions rendered by this Court, which have been referred to in the Reference Order. 27.        Division  Bench   of    this  Court   has   referred   this Question, after observing that there is an apparent conflict between the decisions of this Court in Topline Shoes (supra); Kailash Vs. Nanhku (2005) 4 SCC 480 and Salem Advocate Bar Association vs. Union of India (2005) 6 SCC 344 on the one hand; and Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra) and NIA vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (2015) 16 SCC 22, on the other 28.        In Topline Shoes (supra), a Division Bench of this Court, while dealing with the provisions of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, has held that the said provision would be directory and not mandatory.       While holding so, the Bench relied on the principles of natural justice, and also that no consequence of non­filing of the response to the complaint within 45 days is provided for in the Consumer Protection Act. In paragraph 8 of the said judgment, this Court held: “It is for the Forum or the Commission to consider all facts and circumstances along with the provisions of the Act providing time­ frame to file reply, as a guideline and then to exercise its discretion as best as it may serve the ends of justice and achieve the object of speedy disposal of such cases keeping in mind the principles of natural justice as well”. It is true that in Clause 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer Protection Act, the legislature provided that “quasi–judicial bodies will observe the principles of natural justice”, however, the same is to be observed generally, and not where the same is specifically excluded. In the said judgment, sub­Section (3) of Section 13 has neither been referred, nor taken note of. The same mandates that no proceedings complying with the procedure laid down in sub­Sections (1) and (2) of Section 13 shall be called in question in any Court on the ground that the principles of natural justice have not been complied with. From this it is evident that while considering the provisions of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, the law mandates that the principles of natural justice cannot be said to be violated by adopting the said procedure and that the time of 30 days plus 15 days provided for filing the response to the complaint would be sufficient and final. In case of Topline Shoes (supra), this Court was also of the view that in the Consumer Protection Act, “no consequence is provided in case the time granted to file reply exceeds the total period of 45 days”. While observing so, the Bench did not take into account the provisions of Section 13(2)(b)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides that where the opposite party fails to file response to the complaint within the specified time provided in Clause (a), “the District Forum shall proceed to settle the consumer dispute……… on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the complainant……..”. After the said judgment, by Amendment Act 62 of 2002 (w.e.f. 15.03.2003), the legislature has provided that the District Forum shall proceed to settle the consumer dispute “ex parte on the basis of the evidence”.     The word “ex parte” has been added by the Amending Act. As we have observed herein above, the consequence of not filing the response to the complaint within the stipulated time is thus clearly provided for in the aforesaid sub­Section, which has not been noticed by the Bench while deciding the aforesaid case. 29.         In the case of Kailash vs. Nanhku (supra), this Court was dealing with an election trial under the Representation of People Act, 1951, and while considering the provision under Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code, it held the same to be directory, and not mandatory. While holding so, the Court was of the view that “the consequences flowing from non­extension of time are not specifically provided” in the Code. The decision in the said case has no bearing on the question under consideration, as the present reference before us is under the Consumer Protection Act, where, as we have already observed, consequences are specifically provided for. In passing, in paragraph 35 of the said judgment, the Bench referred to the case of Topline Shoes (supra), where the provision of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act was considered to be directory, and not mandatory. In our view, the same would not have the effect of affirming the decision of Topline Shoes (supra) since the Court, in the aforesaid case, was dealing with the provisions of the Code and not the specific provisions of Consumer Protection Act. We are thus of the opinion that Kailash vs Nanhku (supra) has not overruled the decision in Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra) with regard to the provision of the Consumer Protection 30.        Again,   in  the   case    of  Salem    Advocates  Bar Association (supra), this Court was dealing with a case under Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code and in paragraph 20, it has been “20.………The use of the word “shall” is ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of the provision but having regard to the context in which it is used or having regard to the intention of the legislation, the same can be construed as directory. The rule in question has to advance the cause of justice and not to defeat it. The rules of procedure are made to advance defeat it. Construction of the rule or procedure which promotes justice and prevents miscarriage has to be preferred. The rules of procedure are the handmaid of justice and not its mistress. In the present      context,    the    strict Thereafter, the Court proceeded to refer to the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1, along with Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code.       On a harmonious construction of the said provision, it held that the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code would be directory, and not mandatory. Relevant paragraph 21 of the said judgment “21. In construing this provision, support can also be had from a written statement is required under Rule 1 or Rule 9, fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the court, the court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. On failure to file written statement under this provision, the court has been given the discretion either to pronounce judgment against the defendant or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. In the context of the provision, despite use of the word “shall”, the court has been given the discretion to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant even if the written statement is not filed and instead pass such order as it may think fit in relation to the suit. In construing the required to be applied. The effect would be that under Rule 10 Order 8, the court in its discretion would have the power to allow the defendant to file written statement even after expiry of the period of 90 days provided in Order 8 Rule 1. There is no restriction in Order 8 Rule 10 that after expiry of ninety days, further time cannot be granted. The court has wide relation to the suit as it thinks fit”. Clearly, therefore, the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 providing for the upper limit of 90 days to file written statement is directory”. As such in our view, the said judgment would hold the field with regard to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code and would not be applicable to cases dealing with the provisions of Section 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act, or such other enactment wherein a provision akin to Section 13(2) is there and the consequences are also provided. 31.        The case of Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra) is one relating to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, and has been decided by a Bench of three Judges of this Court (which is after the decision in the case of Topline Shoes (supra) was rendered). In this case it has been held that the time limit prescribed for filing the response to the complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, as provided under Section 13(2)(a), is to be strictly adhered to, i.e. the same is mandatory, and not directory.         In paragraph 13 of the said judgment, it has been held that: “For having speedy trial, this legislative mandate of not giving more than 45 days in submitting the written statement or the version of the case is required to be adhered to.       If this is not mandate of disposing of the cases within three or five months would be defeated. In the said case of Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra), while holding that the time limit prescribed would be mandatory and thus be required to be strictly adhered to, this Court also considered the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer     Protection   (Amendment)      Bill,  2002 (which    was subsequently enacted as Act 62 of 2002 and has come in force w.e.f. 15.03.2003).     The salient features of the same was “to provide    simple,  inexpensive     and   speedy    justice  to  the consumers……….” and that “the disposal of cases is to be faster” and after noticing that “several bottlenecks and shortcomings have also come to light in the implementation of various provisions of the Act” and with a view to achieve quicker disposal of consumer complaints, certain amendments were made in the Act, which    included   “(iii) prescribing  the  period   within   which complaints are to be admitted, notices are to be issued to opposite party and complaints are to be decided”. With this object in mind, in sub­Section (2)(b)(ii) of Section 13, the opening sentence “on the basis of evidence” has been substituted by “ex parte on the basis of evidence”. By this amendment, consequences of not filing the response to the complaint within the specified limit of 45 days was to be that the District Forum shall procced to settle the consumer dispute ex parte on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the complainant, where the opposite party omits or fails to take action to represent his case within time. For achieving the objective of quick disposal of complaints, the Court noticed that sub­Section (3A) of Section 13 was inserted, providing that the complaint should be heard as expeditiously as possible and that endeavour should be made to normally decide the complaint within 3 months, and within 5 months where analysis or testing of commodities was required.     The Provisos to the said sub­ Section required that no adjournment should be ordinarily granted and if granted, it should be for sufficient cause to be recorded in writing and on imposition of cost, and if the complaint could not be decided within the specified period, reasons for the same were to be recorded at the time of disposing of the complaint. It was after observing so, and considering aforesaid amendments, this Court held that the time limit of 30 plus 15 days in filing the response to the complaint, be mandatory and strictly adhered to. 32.        The decision of another Bench of three Judges in NIA vs Hilli Multipurpose Coldstorage (supra), which has been considered in the referring order was passed by a bench of two Judges in the same case, after noticing a conflict of views in the cases of Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra) and Kailash vs Nanhku After considering the provisions of the Code and Consumer Protection Act, the reference was answered “that the law laid down by a three Judge Bench of this Court in Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra) should prevail”. In coming to this conclusion, the following was observed in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the said “25. We are, therefore, of the view that the judgment delivered in J.J. Merchant holds the field and therefore, we reiterate the view that the District Forum can grant a further period of 15 days to the opposite party for filing his version or reply and not beyond that. follow the law laid down in J.J. Merchant.     J.J. Merchant was Court, while dealing Kailash, this Court ought to have respected delivered in J.J. Merchant was earlier in point of time.       The aforesaid legal position cannot be ignored by us and therefore, we are of the opinion that the view expressed in J.J. Merchant should be followed.” 33.        Although, after the above decision, no further reference was required to be made, but still we have proceeded to answer the question referred to this Constitution Bench and are of the considered opinion that the view expressed by this Court in the case of Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra) is the correct view. Question No. 2:       What would be the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986? 34.         The   question   for   determination  is  whether  the limitation under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act for filing the response by the opposite party to the complaint would commence from the date of receipt of the notice of the complaint by the opposite party, or the receipt of notice accompanied by a copy of the complaint. 35.         In paragraph 12 of the judgment dated 04.12.2015, of three Judge Bench of this Court, in this very case of NIA vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (supra), while referring to the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act, it has been held that “The whole issue centres round the period within which the opponent has to give his version to the District Forum in pursuance of a complaint, which is admitted under Section 12 of the Act. Upon receipt of a complaint by the District Forum, if the complaint is admitted under Section 12 of the Act, a copy of the complaint is to be served upon the opposite party and as per the provisions of Section 13 of the Act, the opposite party has to give his version of the case within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the copy of the 36.        However, another two judge Bench of this Court, by an Order dated 18.01.2017 passed in this very Appeal being Civil Appeal No(s).10941­10942 of 2013, NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage, has expressed the view that the declaration made in Dr. J. J. Merchant’s case to the effect that the said period is to be reckoned from the date of receipt of notice by the opposite party or complaint under the Act, requires a more critical analysis. The bench thus opined that “what is the commencing point of the limitation of 30 days stipulated in Section 13 of the Act is required to be decided authoritatively”. It is thus that this question has been placed before us for an authoritative decision. 37.        For deciding this question, we may first analyse the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and the Regulations framed thereunder. Sub­Sections (2)(a) and (2)(b) of Section13 of the Consumer Protection Act specify that it is the copy of the complaint which is to given to the opposite party directing him to give his version of the case within a period of 30 days or such extended period, not exceeding 15 days. As such, from the aforesaid provision itself, it is clear that it is the copy of the admitted complaint which is to be served, after which the period to file the response would commence. Further,    Regulation  10   of    the   Consumer      Protection Regulations, 2005 also specifies the procedure of issuing notice, which should be accompanied by copy of the complaint. Regulation 10(5) clearly mentions that “along with the notice, copies of the complaint, memorandum of grounds of appeal, petitions as the case may be and other documents filed shall be served upon the opposite party(ies)/respondent(s)”. The same would also make it clear that it is on service of a copy of the complaint that the period of limitation for filing the response by the opposite party shall commence. 38.         Even in the Code of Civil Procedure, Order VIII Rule 1 prescribes that the written statement shall be filed by the defendant within 30 days from the receipt of the “summons”. “Summons” has been defined in Order V Rule 1 of the Code and Rule 2 provides that “Every summon shall be accompanied by a copy of the plaint.” While considering the aforesaid provisions, a two judge Bench of this Court in the case of Nahar Enterprises vs Hyderabad Allwyn Ltd. (2007) 9 SCC 466 has, in paragraph 8, 9 and 10, held as under: (8) The learned counsel appears to be correct. When a summons is sent calling upon a defendant to appear in the court and file his written statement, it is obligatory on the part of the court to send a copy of the plaint and other documents appended thereto, in terms of Order 5 Rule 2 CPC. address itself the question as to how a defendant, in absence of a copy of the plaint and other documents, would be able to file statement…………………….……..” 39.        Even in Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, sub­ Section (5) of Section 31 provides that “after the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be delivered to each party”.           An application for setting aside the arbitral award is to be made under Section 34 of the said Act. The delivery of the award sets in motion the limitation for challenging the award under Section 34 of the said Act. While interpreting the nature and scope of Section 31(5) of the said Act, a three Judge Bench of this Court in Union of India vs Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors, (2005) 4 SCC 239, has, in paragraph 6, held as under: (6)    Form and contents of the arbitral award are provided by Section 31 of the Act. The arbitral award drawn up in the manner prescribed by Section 31 of the Act has to be signed and dated. According to sub­section (5), “after the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be delivered to each party”. The term “party” is defined by clause (h) of Section 2 of the Act as meaning “a party to an arbitration     agreement”.      The definition is to be read as given unless the context otherwise requires. Under sub­section (3) of Section 34 the limitation of 3 months commences from the date on which “the party making that application” had received the arbitral award. ……………” From the above, what we notice is that wherever limitation is provided, either for filing response/written statement or filing an appeal, it is the copy of the plaint or the order/award which is to be served on the party concerned after which alone would commence the period of limitation. 40.        Now reverting to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, a conjoint reading of Clauses (a) and (b) of sub­ Section (2) of Section 13 would make the position absolutely clear that the commencing point of limitation of 30 days, under the aforesaid provisions, would be from the date of receipt of notice accompanied by a copy of the complaint, and not merely receipt of the notice, as the response has to be given, within the stipulated time, to the averments made in the complaint and unless a copy of the complaint is served on the opposite party, he would not be in a position to furnish its reply. Thus, mere service of notice, without service of the copy of the complaint, would not suffice and cannot be the commencing point of 30 days under the aforesaid Section of the Act. We may, however, clarify that the objection of not having received a copy of the complaint along with the notice should be raised on the first date itself and not thereafter, otherwise if permitted to be raised at any point later would defeat the very purpose of the Act, which is to provide simple and speedy redressal of consumer disputes. 41.       To conclude, we hold that our answer to the first question is that the District Forum has no power to extend the time for filing the response to the        complaint   beyond the period of 15 days     in   addition to 30 days as is envisaged under     Section     13     of     the    Consumer      Protection Act; and the answer to the second question is that the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act would be from the date of receipt of the notice accompanied with the complaint by the opposite party, and not mere receipt of the notice of the complaint. This Judgment to operate prospectively. The referred questions are answered accordingly.
The matter comes up on an application preferred by Shri Sunil Bhandari representing the respondents seeking dismissal of the writ petition on the ground of it having been filed without proper authorization. The instant writ petition has been filed in representative capacity on behalf of a Union posed as Income Tax Contingent Employees Union. The affidavit in support of the writ petition has been sworn by one Kamal Pal claiming to be a Member and an authorized person of the Union. Shri Sunil Bhandari Advocate representing the respondents has filed an application (I.A.No.1/2021) seeking dismissal of the writ petition on the ground that none of the Members of the so- called union whose cause is sought to be agitated in this writ petition are identifiable. No list of the casual labour who are alleged to be Members of the Union, has been annexed with the writ petition. Furthermore, no proper authorization/resolution passed by the so-called Union for the purpose of filing the Original Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal or the writ petition before this Court has been placed on record. Reliance has been placed by counsel for the respondents on the order dated 17.11.2011 passed in D.B. Civil Writ Union & Anr. Vs. A.N. Jha & Anr.” and the order dated 9.7.2019 passed in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.3798/2019 “Income Tax Contingent Employees Union Vs. Union of India & Ors.” whereby, this Court has held that such writ petitions are not maintainable for lack of proper authorization. Shri Gupta learned counsel representing the petitioners vehemently relied upon the document Annex.7 claiming that in the meeting dated 20.3.2015, the Union authorized him (Shri Gupta) to file the cases on behalf of the Union. He further urged that in the meeting dated 11.4.2018, Shri Kamal Pal had been authorized to plead the matters on behalf of the Union. Shri Gupta thus submits that the writ petition has been presented and is being pursued under proper authorization. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced at the bar and have gone through the material placed on record. Suffice it to say that the minutes of the meeting dated 20.3.2015, which have been referred to by Shri Gupta during the course of his arguments, do not bear signatures of any of the Members of the Union. Furthermore, no list of the Members of the Union has been annexed with the writ petition. Shri Jagdish Solanki claiming to be President of the Union, has authorized Shri Kamal Pal to file the matters on behalf of the Union in the courts. However, no resolution of the Union has been filed on record on the strength whereof, Shri Jagdish Solanki has been authorized to further authorize Shri Kamal Pal to file the Original Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal or the instant writ petition. In similar circumstances, Writ Petition No.2893/2019 filed by the petitioner Union through its so-called President Jagdish Solanki was dismissed by this Court by order dated respondent     has   raised    a    preliminary  objection pertaining to incorporation of petitioner No. 1 and authorization/resolution passed by the members of the Union and authorization given to the Advocate. The respondent counsel has also brought to the knowledge of the Court judgment passed by the Co- ordinate Bench of this Court in DBCWP No.3798/2019 passed on 09.7.2019 wherein relying upon the Rule 7 of  the   Central   Administrative     Tribunal  Rules   of Practice, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules of 1993) and after hearing the arguments, this Court has held that there was non compliance of Rule 7 and in absence of proper and adequate authorization the petition was dismissed.” Hence, we are of the firm view that the writ petition has been filed without proper authorization/resolution and hence, the same is not maintainable. Accordingly, the I.A.No.1/2021 is allowed. The writ petition is dismissed as not maintainable in absence of proper authorization.
1.    The present appeal is directed against an order passed by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission 1 whereby the appellant herein was directed to pay a sum of Rs. 265.01 Crores along with interest @ 10% p.a. from 19.9.2016 within a period of three months. In case of failure to deposit the said amount, the awarded amount would carry compensation in the form of simple interest @ 12% p.a. The appellant has filed an application (IA No. 99210 of 2021) ex abundanti cautela to entertain the appeal as per the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 2. It is the said application which is being decided by the present order. 2.    The complainant was awarded a contract for construction of rain water drainage, heavy sewerage and municipal road system by the Basra, Iraq. The complainant obtained two specific contracts (Letter of Credit Comprehensive Risks Policies) by paying a sum of ₹10,38,03,912/- as premium to the appellant. The grievance of the complainant was that the payment for invoices issued for the work done under the contract was suspended. Later, the contract also was withdrawn by the Government of Basra owing to some internal conflict. The appellant herein rejected the insurance claim of the complainant and thus relief was sought before the National Commission by filing a complaint under Section 21(a)(i) of the 1986 Act. The said complaint was allowed on 3.     The question now being examined here is as to whether the present appeal would be governed under the Consumer Protection Act, 20193 or under the erstwhile 1986 Act. 4.     In terms of Section 67 of the 2019 Act, no appeal against the order of National Commission shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless the person has deposited fifty per cent of the amount required to be paid. Whereas, under the 1986 Act, by virtue of a proviso inserted vide Central Act 62 of 2002 w.e.f. 15.3.2003, the condition was that no appeal shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless the person who is required to pay the amount deposits fifty per cent of the amount or fifty thousand, whichever is Provided further that no appeal by a Provided further that no appeal person who is required to pay any    by a person who is required to amount in terms of an order of the   pay any amount in terms of an National Commission shall be         order of the National Commission entertained by the Supreme Court     shall be entertained by the unless that person has deposited in  Supreme Court unless that the prescribed manner fifty per cent person has deposited fifty per of that amount or rupees fifty       cent of that amount in the thousand, whichever is less.         manner as may be prescribed. 5.    Learned Attorney General appearing for the appellant submitted that the appeal has been preferred under Section 23 of the 1986 Act and not under the 2019 Act which came into force from 20.7.2020. It was stated that the condition of deposit of 50% of the amount is more onerous than what was provided under the 1986 Act. Therefore, keeping in view the principle that the law which is applicable at the time of initiation of the lis would be applicable, the provisions of 1986 Act would govern the present appeal and not the provisions of 2019 Act.         The appellant has deposited ₹50,000/- vide demand draft in terms of second proviso to Section 23 of the 1986 Act while exercising its right of appeal under the 1986 Act. Hence, the present appeal be heard on merits. 6.    The learned Attorney General inter alia argued that Section 107 of 2019 Act and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 4 unequivocally operate against any question of retrospectivity. Sub- Section (2) of Section 107 of 2019 Act does not change the legal position as mentioned under Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. To appreciate the argument, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and Section 107 of the 2019 Act are reproduced hereunder: 6. Effect of Repeal. - Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal (a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at (b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or any thing duly done or suffered thereunder; or (c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed; or (d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any enactment so (e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had not been passed. 107. (1) The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is hereby (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the Act hereby repealed shall, in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act. (3) The mention of particular matters in sub-section (2) shall not be held to prejudice or affect the general application of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 with regard to the effect of repeal.” 7. Sub-section (2) of Section 107 of the 2019 Act protects the actions taken under the 1986 Act insofar as such actions are not inconsistent with the provisions of 2019 Act. Such actions shall be deemed to have been undertaken as per the corresponding provisions of 2019 Act.      Sub-section (3) contemplates that the particular matters in sub-section (2) shall not prejudice or affect the general application of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act with regard to the effect of repeal. Referring to clause (c) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, it was argued that unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed.       Further, Clause (e) stipulates that the repeal shall not affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment which may be imposed as if the repealing Act or the Regulation has not been passed. It was thus argued that the repeal of enactment does not affect any right acquired or accrued under the enactment so repealed or affect any legal proceeding in respect of such a right. Such effect was to be construed only when a different intention appears from the repealing statute.     It was thus argued that the right to file an appeal under the 1986 Act has accrued in favour of the appellant in terms of Section 6(c) of the General Clauses Act and that no different intention is discernable from the repealing Act. 8.    To support the above arguments, the learned Attorney General has relied upon Division Bench judgment of the Calcutta High Court reported as Nogendra Nath Bose v. Mon Mohan Singha Roy & Ors.5 which was approved by this Court in a judgment reported as Hoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd. v. State of Madhya S.R. Das speaking for the Bench with Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.C. Mahajan was examining a matter consequent to the amendment on 25.11.1949 by the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Act (Act 57 of 1949) amending the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The proviso to Section 22(1) of the 1947 Act prior to the amendment as enacted provided that no appeal against an order of assessment shall be entertained unless it was satisfied that such amount of tax or penalty or both as the appellant may admit to be due from him has been paid. The amending act contemplated that no appeal shall be entertained unless an appeal is accompanied by a satisfactory proof of the payment of the tax, with penalty, if any, in respect of which the appeal has been preferred.     Therefore, there was change in the condition of preferring an appeal from the amount admitted to be due by the assessee than the payment of the tax and penalty of in respect of which an appeal has been preferred. 9.    It may be relevant to mention that the Court also noticed the argument of the learned counsel for the State that until actual assessment is made, there can be no lis and therefore, no right of appeal can accrue before that date. The Court observed that when assessee files a return, the lis may not immediately arise.               The authority may assess the return under Section 11 of the 1947 Act, but if the authority is not satisfied as to the correctness of the return and call for evidence, a controversy arises. In the aforesaid case, the sales tax return was filed on 28.11.1947 and a notice by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax was issued on 25.1.1949 i.e. prior to the amendment. This Court held as under: “8. The above decisions quite firmly establish and our decisions in Janardan Reddy v. State [(1950) SCR 941] and in Ganpat Rai v. Agarwal Chamber of Commerce Ltd. [(1952) SCJ 564] uphold the principle that a right of appeal is not merely a matter of procedure. It is a matter of substantive right. This right of appeal from the decision of an inferior tribunal to a superior tribunal becomes vested in a party when proceedings are first initiated in, and before a decision is given by, the inferior court. In the language of Jenkins, C.J. in Nana bin Aba v. Shaik bin Andu to disturb an existing right of appeal is not a mere alteration in procedure. Such a vested right cannot be taken away except by express enactment or necessary intendment. An intention to interfere with or to impair or imperil such a vested right cannot be presumed unless such intention be clearly manifested by express words or necessary implication. 9. …. In our view the above observation is apposite and applies to the case before us. The true implication of the above observation as of the decisions in the other cases referred to above is that the pre-existing right of appeal is not destroyed by the amendment if the amendment is not made retrospective by express words or necessary intendment. The fact that the pre-existing right of appeal continues to exist must, in its turn, necessarily imply that the old law which created that right of appeal must also exist to support the continuation of that right. As the old law continues to exist for the purpose of supporting the pre- existing right of appeal that old law must govern the exercise and enforcement of that right of appeal and there can then be no question of the amended provision preventing the exercise of that right. The argument that the authority has no option or jurisdiction to admit the appeal unless it be accompanied by the deposit of the assessed tax as required by the amended proviso to Section 22(1) of the Act overlooks the fact of existence of the old law for the purpose of supporting the pre-existing right and really amounts to begging the question. The new proviso is wholly inapplicable in such a situation and the jurisdiction of the authority has to be exercised under the old law which so continues to exist. The argument of Sri Ganapathy Aiyer on this point, therefore, cannot be accepted. 10.     Finally, Sri Ganapathy Aiyer faintly urges that until actual assessment there can be no “lis” and, therefore, no right of appeal can accrue before that event. There are two answers to this plea. Whenever there is a proposition by one party and an opposition to that proposition by another a “lis” arises. It may be conceded, though not deciding it, that when the assessee files his return a “lis” may not immediately arise, for under Section 11(1) the authority may accept the return as correct and complete. But if the authority is not satisfied as to the correctness of the return and calls for evidence, surely a controversy arises involving a proposition by the assessee and an opposition by the State. The circumstance that the authority who raises the dispute is himself the Judge can make no difference, for the authority raises the dispute in the interest of the State and in so acting only represents the State. It will appear from the dates given above that in this case the “lis” in the sense explained above arose before the date of amendment of the section. Further, even if the “lis” is to be taken as arising only on the date of assessment, there was a possibility of such a “lis” arising as soon as proceedings started with the filing of the return or, at any rate, when the authority called for evidence and started the hearing and the right of appeal must be taken to have been in existence even on those dates. For the purposes of the accrual of the right of appeal the critical and relevant date is the date of initiation of the proceedings and not the decision itself.” 10.    Subsequently, the Constitution Bench in a judgment reported as Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhry & Ors.7 approved the judgment in Hoosein Kasam Dada, though the issue was in respect of right of appeal to the Federal Court under the Government of India Act, 1935. The argument was that the appellant had a right to file an appeal as the suit, out of which the proceedings arose before this Court, was filed on 22.4.1949. Hence, he had acquired a vested right to appeal to the Federal Court which has since been replaced by the Supreme Court. It was the said argument which was accepted by the Constitution Bench when the following principles were delineated: “23. From the decisions cited above the following principles (i) That the legal pursuit of a remedy, suit, appeal and second appeal are really but steps in a series of proceedings all connected by an intrinsic unity and are to be regarded as one legal proceeding. (ii) The right of appeal is not a mere matter of procedure but is a substantive right. (iii) The institution of the suit carries with it the implication that all rights of appeal then in force are preserved to the parties thereto till the rest of the career of the suit. (iv) The right of appeal is a vested right and such a right to enter the superior court accrues to the litigant and exists as on and from the date the lis commences and although it may be actually exercised when the adverse judgment is pronounced such right is to be governed by the law prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit or proceeding and not by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of the filing of the appeal. (v) This vested right of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise. 24. In the case before us the suit was instituted on April 22, 1949, and on the principle established by the decisions referred to above the right of appeal vested in the parties thereto at that date and is to be governed by the law as it prevailed on that date, that is to say, on that date the parties acquired the right, if unsuccessful, to go up in appeal from the sub-court to the High Court and from the High Court to the Federal Court under the Federal Court (Enlargement of Jurisdiction) Act, 1947 read with clause 39 of the Letters Patent and Sections 109 and 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure provided the conditions thereof were satisfied. The question for our consideration is whether that right has been taken away expressly or by necessary intendment by any subsequent enactment. The respondents to the application maintain that it has been so taken away by the provisions of our Constitution.” 11.    In a three-Judge Bench judgment reported as State of Bombay v. M/s. Supreme General Films Exchange Ltd. & Anr. 8, the argument which arose for consideration was that the court fees payable on the memorandum of appeal would be as on the date of filing of the suit and not as per the amendment in the Court Fees Act, 1870 by Bombay Act 12 of 1954.                 The court fee on the memorandum of appeal was thus held to be payable as was applicable prior to the amendment of the Act. This Court held as “12. It is thus clear that in a long line of decisions approved by this Court and at least in one given by this Court, it has been held that an impairment of the right of appeal by putting a new restriction thereon or imposing a more onerous condition is not a matter of procedure only; it impairs or imperils a substantive right and an enactment which does so is not retrospective unless it says so expressly or by necessary intendment.” 12.    The Constitution Bench in Vitthalbhai Naranbhai Patel v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, M.P., Nagpur 9 was considering a matter where the date on which sales tax returns were filed was not disclosed. In the absence of the date of filing of the return, this “9. The decision in Hoosein Kasam Dada’s case, 1953 SCR 987: (AIR 1953 SC 221), proceeded on the ground that when a lis commences, all rights get crystallised and no clog upon a likely appeal can be put, unless the law was made retrospective, expressly or by clear implication. From the record of this case, we cannot say when the lis commenced, and unless it can be proved conclusively that it was before the amendment of the law, the rule in Hoosein Kasam Dada’s case, 1953 SCR 987: (AIR 1953 SC 221), cannot apply. There is no averment that right of appeal had vested, and has been wrongly taken away.” 13.   In another Constitution Bench judgment of this Court reported as M/s. Hardeodas Jagannath v. The State of Assam & Ors.10, none of the previous judgments were referred to and thus, it prima facie appears to have taken a somewhat different view than what was held in the earlier Constitution Bench judgments. But if examined closely, the said judgment is not taking any contrary view and is in line with the earlier judgments of this Court. The issue was about an amendment dated 1.4.1958 in the Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947 requiring deposit of assessed tax and penalty as condition of filing of appeal.     The assessee had filed half yearly returns for periods ending on 30.9.1956, 31.3.1957 and 30.9.1957 respectively.    The premises of the assessee were searched on 6.3.1959 and the account books etc. were seized. A notice for reassessment was issued on 4.4.1959 under Section 19A of the Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947. It was in this background, this Court “9. It was contended that the amendment came into force with effect from April 1, 1958 and it cannot be given retrospective effect so as to apply to assessment periods ending on September 30, 1956, March 31, 1957 and September 30, 1957. We are unable to accept this argument as correct because the assessments for these three periods were completed after the amending Act came into force i.e., after April 1, 1958. The appeals against the assessments were also filed after the amendment. It is therefore not correct to say that the amending Act has been given a retrospective effect and the Assistant Commissioner of Taxes was therefore right in asking the appellant to comply with the provisions of the amended Section 30 of the Act before dealing with the appeals.” 14.   Since the returns were filed prior to the amendment but the notice for reassessment was issued after the Amending Act came into force, therefore, in view of the Hoosein Kasam Dada, the provisions of the Amending Act alone would be applicable and that is what has been held by this Court. 15.   In a judgment reported as K. Raveendranathan Nair & Anr. v. Commissioner of Income Tax & Ors. 11, it has been held that the relevant date for paying the court fee would be when the proceedings were initiated in the lowest court and not when the appeal was preferred before the High Court in view of the amendment in the Kerala Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959. 16.   In Anant Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Gujarat & Ors.12, a four- Judge Bench of this Court held that since the authority entertaining appeal has a jurisdiction to dispense with the compliance of requirement to deposit the amount of property tax, it is not onerous as discretion was vested with the appellate court.         In another judgment reported as Gujarat Agro Industries Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad & Ors. 13, the judgment in Anant Mills was followed. 17.    This Court in a judgment reported as Ramesh Singh & Anr. v. Cinta Devi & Ors.14 held that an appeal under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 contemplating deposit of twenty-five thousand rupees or fifty per cent of the amount whichever is less will not be applicable to the claim applications filed under Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. Similar is the view of another Bench of this Court in a judgment reported as M/s Gurcharan Singh Baldev Singh v. Yashwant Singh & Ors.15 wherein the right of appeal conferred under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 could not be said to be taken away after repeal of such Act by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 18.    Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that the amendment is procedural in nature and     thus  always   retrospective. Reliance  was     placed  upon Thirumalai Chemicals Limited v. Union of India & Ors.16. It was averred that procedure includes the manner and form of filing of appeal, pre-deposit and limitation. The right of appeal is a statutory right which can be taken away by express provision of law, therefore, the conditions on which an appeal would lie is also within the legislative competence. 19. We find that the reliance on Thirumalai Chemicals Limited may not be correct as this Court held that Section 49 of FEMA does not seek to withdraw or take away the vested right of appeal in cases where proceedings were initiated prior to repeal of FERA on 01.06.2000 or after. The said judgment in fact held that liberal provision of condonation of delay as provided in the new Act would “28. Above discussion will clearly demonstrate that Section 49 of FEMA does not seek to withdraw or take away the vested right of appeal in cases where proceedings were initiated prior to repeal of FERA on 01.06.2000 or after. On a combined reading of Section 49 of FEMA and Section 6 of General Clauses Act, it is clear that the procedure prescribed by FEMA only would be applicable in respect of an appeal filed under FEMA though cause of action arose under FERA. In fact, the time limit prescribed under FERA was taken away under the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 19 and the Tribunal has been conferred with wide powers to condone delay if the appeal is not filed within forty-five days prescribed, provided sufficient cause is shown. Therefore, the findings rendered by the Tribunal as well as the High Court that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond the date prescribed under FERA is not a correct understanding of the law on the subject. 29. We, therefore, hold that the Appellate Tribunal can entertain the appeal after the prescribed period of 45 days if it is satisfied, that there was sufficient cause for not filing the appeal within the said period. We are therefore inclined to set aside the orders passed by the Tribunal and the High Court and remit the matter back to the Tribunal for fresh consideration in accordance with law on the basis of the findings recorded by us…” 20.    Mr. Gupta also referred to the three-Judge Bench judgment of this Court reported as Newtech Promoters and Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. State of UP & Ors.17 wherein pre-deposit was required to be made while filing an appeal under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. The said judgment is not applicable as while framing the statute, Section 43(5) contemplating pre- deposit was part of the initially enacted provision.           Similarly, another judgment reported as Tecnimont Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Punjab & Ors.18 is also in respect of right of appeal on pre-deposit which was enacted originally in the Punjab Value Added Tax Act. 21.    The learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon Division Bench judgments in Sri Satya Nand Jha v. Union of India & Ors.19 and M/s. Indian Oil Corporation v. Orissa Sales Tax Tribunal, CTC & Ors.20. It is to be noted that the Orissa High Court in Indian Oil Corporation was in fact considering the reverse proposition wherein condition of pre-deposit of 50% of the deposited amount of tax was deleted. The writ petition was filed by the assessee to challenge the notice issued by the State to deposit 50% of the deposited amount after the amendment. The “24. The Apex Court time & again held that right of appeal is a substantive right, but how the appeal is to be decided is a matter of procedure. The rules of procedure are intended to advance justice & not to defeat it. “Procedural law is intended to facilitate & not to obstruct the course of substantive justice.” (vide Hoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd. v. State of M.P., AIR 1953 SC 221; Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhry; AIR 1957 SC 540; M/s. Ganesh Trading Co. v. Moji Ram, (1978) 2 SCC 91 : AIR 1978 SC 484; Harcharan v. State of Haryana, (1982) 3 SCC 408 : Nagpur v. Swaraj Developers, (2003) 6 SCC 659 : AIR 2003 25. In the instant case, as the provision of the pre-deposit condition for entertaining the appeal has been deleted prior to entertaining the appeal being a procedural matter, the amendment would apply retrospectively. The instant case is squarely covered by the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lakshmi Rattan Engineering Works Ltd. (supra).” 22. The High Court of Jharkhand in Sri Satya Nand Jha was dealing with the amendment in Section 35 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 by Section 105 of the Finance Act, 2014 prescribing that 7.5% or 10% of the duty demand or penalty levied is to be deposited. In the said case, the pre-amended provision was that if the appellate authority on being satisfied that the deposit of the duty demanded or penalty levied would cause undue hardship, then the condition of pre-deposit could be dispensed with. But subsequent to the amendment, 7% of the duty assessed and 10% of the penalty levied was made mandatory to be deposited. It may be noticed that the second proviso clarified that the provisions of the amended Section 35 shall not be applied to the stay applications and appeals pending before any appellate authority prior to the commencement of the Finance Act, 2014. Therefore, the issue arising in the said case was of legality and validity of the pre- deposit and not the retrospectivity of the said provision. 23.   Mr. Gupta has relied upon the judgment of this Court in Manohar Infrastructure and Constructions Private Limited v. Sanjeev Kumar Sharma & Ors.21 in which the dispute was that the NCDRC had granted stay subject to deposit of the entire decretal amount. No argument was raised or decided for retrospectivity of Section 51 of the 2019 Act but the question raised was whether the NCDRC could direct such deposit of the entire decretal amount pending appeal though the statute prescribes pre-deposit of 50% of the amount in dispute. 24.   It was contended that the consumer protection legislation is a beneficial legislation, therefore, the interpretation which benefits the consumer should be preferred as held by this Court in Neena Aneja & Anr. v. Jai Prakash Associates Ltd.22. 25.    It is to be noted that in Neena Aneja, this Court held that right to forum is not an accrued right. Section 6(e) of the General Clauses Act protects the pending legal proceeding for enforcement of the accrued right from the effect of repeal; it does not mean the legal proceeding at a particular forum was saved from the effect of repeal. This Court found that there was no express intention in the repealing      enactment        that     all  pending    cases would stand transferred to the fora created under 2019 Act. This Court held as 21 Civil Appeal No. 7098 of 2021 with Ors. decided on 7.12.2021 “78. Having stated the above position, we need to harmonize it with the principle that the right to a forum is not an accrued right, as discussed in Part C of this judgement. Simply put, while Section 6(e) of the General Clauses Act protects the pending legal proceedings for the enforcement of an accrued right from the effect of a repeal, this does not mean that the legal proceedings at a particular forum are saved from the effects from the repeal. The question whether the pending legal proceedings are required to be transferred to the newly created forum by virtue of the repeal would still persist. As discussed, this Court     in New     India     Assurance (supra)     and Maria Christina (supra) has held that forum is a matter pertaining to procedural law and therefore the litigant has to pursue the legal proceedings at the forum created by the repealing act, unless a contrary intention appears. This principle would also apply to pending proceedings, as observed in Ramesh and Sudhir G Angur (supra). In this backdrop, what is relevant to ascertain is whether a contrary intent to the general rule of retrospectivity has been expressed under the Act of 2019 to continue the proceedings at the older forum. 79. Now, in considering the expression of intent in the repealing enactment in the present case, it is apparent that there is no express language indicating that all pending cases would stand transferred to the fora created by the Act of 2019 by applying its newly prescribed pecuniary limits. In deducing whether there is a contrary intent, the legislative scheme and procedural history may provide a relevant insight into the intention of the legislature. 84. … The legislature cannot be attributed to be remiss in not explicitly providing for transfer of pending cases according to the new pecuniary limits set up for the fora established by the new law, were that to be its intention. The omission, when contextualized against the statutory scheme, portends a contrary intention to protect pending proceedings through Section 107(2) of the Act of 2019. This intention appears likely, particularly in light of previous decisions of the NCDRC which had interpreted amendments that enhanced pecuniary jurisdiction, with prospective effect. The NCDRC, in Southfield Paints and Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Consumer Case No. 286 of 2000 (NCDRC) construed amending Act 62 of 2002 by which the pecuniary limits of jurisdiction were enhanced with effect from 15 March 2003 as prospective by relying on its earlier decision in Premier Automobiles Ltd. v. Dr. Manoj Ramachandran, Revision Petitions Nos. 400 to 402 of 1993, where the NCDRC held that the amendments enhancing the pecuniary jurisdiction are prospective in nature [albeit on a reliance of the principle in Dhadi Sahu (supra)]. Parliament would be conscious of this governing principle and yet chose not to alter it in its application to the consumer fora.” 26.   Having said so, this Court held that serious hardship would be caused to the consumers if the cases already instituted before National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission were required to be transferred to the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum. Thereafter, the proceedings instituted before the commencement of 2019 Act would continue before the fora corresponding to the provisions under the 1986 Act. 27.   Reliance was also placed upon judgment of this Court reported as New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Shanti Misra23 wherein the change in forum was said to be covered under procedural law. In the said referred judgment, there was change of forum of filing of a claim application under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1939 from that of a civil suit. It was held that change of forum would apply retrospectively. It was held that claimant have a vested right of action and not of forum. Such is not the question posed before us in the present appeal. 28.   The change of forum and period of limitation have been held to be procedural law even in the judgments reported in Videocon International Limited v. Securities and Exchange Board of India24, and Maria Cristina De Souza Sodder & Ors. v. Amria 29.    Mr. Gupta has also relied upon Harihar Polyfibres v. Regional v. Harjol Ahluwalia & Anr.27, Kishore Lal v. Chairman, Employees’ State Insurance Corpn.28 and K.H. Nazar v. Mathew K. Jacob & Ors.29 to contend that in respect of beneficial legislations, the interpretation which support the intention of law should be accepted. 30.    In Harihar Polyfibres, this Court was examining the scope of expression wages in the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948. It was held that the Act in question was a beneficial legislation and thus any ambiguous expression was bound to receive a beneficial construction. The present dispute is not of any ambiguity, therefore principles laid down in this case are not applicable. 31.    In Spring Meadows Hospital, this Court held that the definition clause of Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the 1986 Act is wide enough to include not only the person who hires the services but also the beneficiary of such services. Thus, both the parents of the child as well as the child would be consumer under the 1986 Act to claim compensation under the Act. In Kishore Lal, this court held that the definition of 'consumer' in the 1986 Act is apparently wide enough and encompasses within its fold not only the goods but also the services, bought or hired for consideration. In K.H. Nazar, the question was, whether a rocky land which was used for quarrying purposes can be treated as a “commercial site”, thus exempt from the purview of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963. We are not concerned with interpretation to be given to a clause in the statute as in the judgments referred to by the respondents but only with the effect of substitution of a provision than earlier provisions. 32.   The Division Bench of the Madras High Court in M/s. Dream Castle & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.30 dealing with amended Section 35 of the Central Excise Act by Finance Act No. 2 of 2014 held that when the unamended condition gave only a chance or hope for an assessee to get a total waiver at the discretion of the Appellate Authority, the same cannot be equated to a vested right or stated to be retrospective, unless it is definitely shown that the amended        condition      is   more     onerous than   the  unamended “54. Therefore, it is well settled that the right of appeal is a creature of statute and the legislature is well within its competence to impose conditions for the exercise of such a right subject only to the restriction that the conditions so imposed are not so onerous as to amount to unreasonable restrictions rendering the right almost illusory. 30 W.P. No. 13431 of 2015 etc. decided on 18.4.2016 59. Therefore, if one condition that was already available in the statute for the exercise of a right of appeal, is merely replaced by another condition, the same cannot be said to be retrospective, unless it is definitely shown that the amended condition is more onerous than the unamended condition. When the unamended condition gave only a chance or hope for an assessee to get a total waiver at the discretion of the Appellate Authority, the same cannot be equated to a vested right. A mere chance of convincing the Appellate Authority to exercise the discretion for the grant of a total waiver is no vested right. The amendment, in our considered view, did not take away a right vested, but merely made a chance divested. What has now gone, is not the right, but the chance or hope. Therefore, the first contention of the learned Senior counsel for the petitioner is liable to be rejected.” 33. There is another line of judgments taking a view that right of appeal is a creation of statute and the legislature is competent to determine the conditions on which an appeal would lie. These are not the cases of amending or repeal of a statute, therefore, such judgments are not applicable to the questions arising in the present application. 34. In view of the binding precedents of the Constitution Bench judgments referred to above, we hold that onerous condition of payment of 50% of the amount awarded will not be applicable to the complaints filed prior to the commencement of the 2019 Act. Therefore, the I.A. is allowed.

Nagar, by which the cognizance for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. & ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act was taken against the applicants on the basis of charge-sheet submitted by police. In this application, the husband of opposite party no.2 was impleaded as applicant no.3, but his name was deleted later on. 3.     The brief facts necessary for disposal of this application is that the opposite party no.2 Anushka alias Bharti Singh wife of Amitesh Singh lodged a first information report on 2.11.2017 at 11:05 a.m. in Case Crime No.0076 of 2017, under Sections 498A, 323, 376, 511, 504, 506 I.P.C. and ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station Mahila Thana, District J.P.

In this marriage, her parents incurred an amount of Rs.20 lacs including household articles and a cheque of Rs.1,51,000/-, but even after this, her in-law), Deepak Kumar (Jeth), Anamika Yadav (Jethani) were not pleased with the dowry given in her marriage. Immediately after the marriage, they started demanding Rs.10 lacs cash in dowry and her husband also demanded that Car (Xcent Hyundai) which was given in her marriage and registered in the name of opposite party no.2 be transferred in the name of her husband. The opposite party no.2 tried to convince them, but they didn’t not agree and started harassing         the opposite party no.2 financially, mentally and physically and assaulting her due to non-fulfilment of the demand of dowry. The opposite party no.2 also got sustained injuries on account of assault. After that on conspiracy of her in-laws, her husband started living with her in a rented house in Noida from April, 2017 to 17th September, 2017, where her husband continuously demanded the dowry and kept it on and on refusal by her, she was badly beaten and on 17th September, 2017, her husband leaving leaving her alone in Noida, came to his house at Bareilly. Thereafter, her Jeth Deepak came to her at Noida and tried to drink her alcohol and on protest he started doing obscene act with the opposite party no.2 and assaulted her and forcibly tried to have physical relationship saying that everything goes on in his house and her husband also enjoys with his wife. On alarm raised by opposite party no.2, he fled away. Thereafter, the opposite party no.2 called her father and came with him to her parental village situated in Rajasthan. The anger of her in- laws did not subside and on 24.9.2017, her husband Amitesh, father-in- law Ram Kunwar, mother-in-law Kiran Kunwar, Jeth Deepak Kumar and Jethani Anamika Yadav to came to her parental home in Rajasthan, she treated them well and asked them to sit down, thereafter, they started saying that they did not come here to sit, but to finalise the matter and started repeating their demands for additional dowry. Thereupon, the opposite party no.2 refused to fulfil their demand. Upon which, they became aggressive and her husband and Jeth started abusing her in filthy languages and beaten her and he Jeth also did obscene act with her. On seeing it, her mother forbade them and tried to save her, thereupon, her husband and in-laws started assaulting upon her mother and stated that they will kill her. She raised alarm, thereupon, Amarnath Sharma, Ramnath Singh and others gathered there and on it, her in-laws fled away from there. In this assault, the opposite party no.2 sustained several injuries. She complained the matter to police at Police Station Mahila Thana, Amroha, but no action was taken by the police. She also send the complaint by registered post to Mahil Thana, but also no action was taken. Thereafter, she moved an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Amroha and on the order of the court, the first information report was lodged. After lodging of the first information report, the Investigating Officer recorded the statement of the complainant and witnesses. The victim/opposite party no.2 was medically examined on 4.10.2017 at CHC, Amroha and the following injuries were found on her body at the time of medical “1.

Opinion – All injuries are caused by hard and blunt object. Injuries are simple in nature. Duration is about 9 days old.” 4.     After investigation, the charge-sheet was submitted against accused Amitesh Singh, Ram Kunwar, Kiran Kunwar in Case Crime No.0076 of 2017, under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and ¾ of The cognizance on the charge-sheet was taken by learned Civil Judge (SD)/F.T.C./Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Amroha for the offence punishable under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act on the basis of charge-sheet vide order dated 20.4.2018 and summoned the accused for facing trial. Feeling aggrieved by it, the instant application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been moved. 5.      Counter affidavit and rejoinder affidavit have been exchanged. Supplementary affidavit has been also filed on behalf of applicants. In counter affidavit, father of opposite party no.2 has denied the allegations of the affidavit filed in support of the application and has supported the allegations of the first information report, injury report as well as charge- sheet. It is also alleged that on the basis of first information report, injury report, statements of the witnesses, the prima-facie case punishable under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act is made out and learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Amroha has taken cognizance of the aforesaid offence on the basis of charge-sheet in accordance with law, which requires no interference. 6.      Rejoinder affidavit has also been filed in which the contents of counter affidavit has been denied and stated that there are general and false allegations levelled against the applicants and they have been falsely dragged just for the reason that they are the father and mother of the husband of opposite party no.2 and the case is covered with the law laid down by Hon’ble Apex Court in “Geeta Mehrotra Vs. State of UP reported in 2013(1) JIC 1 (SC)”. It is further alleged that the first information report is based on concocted story as the allegations are baseless and are levelled against the applicants just to harass them. 7.      It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that the impugned order dated 20.4.2018 for taking cognizance of the offence has been passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate by filling in the blanks on the computer typed proforma. It is further submitted that the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate has not applied his judicial mind while taking cognizance of the offence on the basis of charge-sheet and on this count the order of taking cognizance of the offence dated 20.4.2018 is liable to be set aside. It is further submitted that the first information report has been lodged by opposite party no.2 on the basis of concocted story just to drag the applicants in the litigation to harass them. It is further submitted that the first information report is anti-time and is based on false and concocted story and all allegations are baseless and are levelled against the applicants just harass them. It is further submitted that the applicants are father-in- law and mother-in-law of opposite party no.2 and they are living separately at Bareilly while the opposite party no.2 was living with her husband at Noida and they had no concern with the matrimonial dispute in between opposite party no.2 and her husband. It is further submitted that applicant no.1 is very old lady aged about 65 years and is suffering from terminal diseases and applicant no.2 is also old aged person and both of them were living separately along with their another son. It is further submitted that the applicants never demanded additional dowry of Rs.10 lacs from the opposite party no.2 or her parents. It is further submitted that the applicant nos.1 and 2 are not beneficiary of the aforesaid alleged demand. It is further submitted that the opposite party no.2 belongs to a rich family and she was not interested to discharge her duty in household works and used to compare the in-laws family with her parental family and she is not interested to live with her husband due to her arrogant nature. It is further submitted that opposite party no.2 filed the present complaint against the applicants after she had gone to her parental home and lodged the first information report only to harass the applicants. It is further submitted that the impugned order of taking cognizance has been passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate on the printed proforma, which shows that he has not applied his mind and the order of taking cognizance is liable to be quashed on this count alone and he has relied on the judgment of Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad in “Pankaj Jaiswal Vs. State of U.P. and another 2021 0 Supreme (All) 491” and the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Mirza Iqbal @ Golu and another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another 2021 0 Supreme (SC) 795” and has submitted that no specific allegations have been levelled against mother-in-law and father- in-law, who are applicant nos.1 & 2 and on that count the order of lower court is liable to be set aside. It is further submitted that this case pertains to the family dispute, therefore, the court ought to have tried to settle the dispute through mediation. It is further submitted that Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Geeta Mehrotra and another Vs. State of U.P. and another reported in AIR 2013 Supreme Court 181” has held that in F.I.R. the allegations as to active involvement of the applicants is absent, mere casual reference to their names in F.I.R. is not sufficient to take cognizance. It is further submitted that in F.I.R., charge-sheet and statement of witnesses, there is no specific and distinct allegations made against the applicant no.1 and applicant no.2, the allegations are general and omnibus and can be said to have been made out on account of small skirmishes. In above circumstances, the order of taking cognizance on the charge-sheet, charge-sheet and the proceeding of the lower court is liable to be quashed. He has relied on the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and others Vs. State of Bihar and others reported in 2022 0 Supreme (SC) 117”. It is further submitted that the Investigating Officer has submitted the impugned charge-sheet against the applicants in an illegal and arbitrary manner. It is submitted that in above circumstances, the impugned order dated 20.4.2018 for taking cognizance of offence on the basis of charge-sheet and the proceeding of the aforesaid criminal case is liable to be set aside. 8.      Learned A.G.A. and learned counsel for informant have opposed the prayer of application and have submitted that from perusal of the first page of the charge-sheet, it is abundantly clear that cognizance was taken on the order sheet on 20.4.2018 and the cognizance order was carried out on the printed proforma of the order sheet, therefore, it cannot be said that the order of cognizance was passed on the printed proforma. It is further submitted that specific allegations have been made against the applicant nos.1 & 2 regarding demand of Rs.10 lacs and assaulting and maltreatment by applicant nos.1 & 2 with husband of the deceased and maltreated on account of non-fulfilment of the dowry, therefore, in above circumstances, it is submitted that the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Geeta Mehrotra and another Vs. State of U.P. and another (supra), Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and others Vs. State of Bihar (supra) and Mirza Iqbal @ Golu and another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another (supra) are not applicable in this case. It is further contended that the cognizance was taken on the charge- sheet and later on it was drawn on the printed proforma of the order sheet, therefore, it cannot be said that the cognizance was taken on printed proforma, therefore, in above circumstances, it is submitted that the law laid down by Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad in Pankaj Jaiswal Vs. State of U.P. and another 2021 0 Supreme (All) 491 (supra) is not applicable in this case. It is further submitted that this case relates to the family disputes and in such cases it is not required to be referred to Family Welfare Committee of District Legal Service Authority. In view of law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar and another Vs. Union of India Ministry of Law and Justice and others 2018 0 Supreme (SC) 877”. It is also submitted that prima-facie case against the accused is made out and has submitted that at the stage of proceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the court cannot adjudicate upon. At this stage only prima facie case is to be seen in the light of the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in “R.P. Kapur Vs. State of Punjab, A.L.R. 1960 S.C. 866, State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 SCC (Cr.) 426 as well as M/ s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra and others, 2020 SCC Online SC 850” . In above circumstances, the impugned order of taking cognizance on the basis of charge-sheet and charge-sheet itself and the proceeding of the lower court is not liable to be quashed and the instant application has been moved with malafide intention to delay the proceeding of the court. 9.     I have given thoughtful consideration to the rival contentions raised by learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record. From perusal of the first information report, injury report and the statement of the informant and witnesses, prima-facie case punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and Section ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act is made out against the applicants. The genuineness of the prosecution case cannot be determined in the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and to determine the genuineness of the prosecution case can be only seen by trial court after recording the evidence. This Court cannot adjudicate upon in the proceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C. in view of law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in “R.P. Kapur Vs. State of Punjab, A.L.R. 1960 S.C. 866, State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 SCC (Cr.) 426” where the first information report and the material available on CD and the charge-sheet discloses the commission of non-cognizable offence. From perusal of the first information report and the material available on record and the charge- sheet, prima-facie case punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and Section ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act is made out against the applicants and it requires no interference in the impugned order of learned court below. 10.    So far as the argument of learned counsel for applicant regarding order on printed proforma is concerned, from perusal of order-sheet, it is abundantly clear that the order of taking cognizance was passed on the first page of the charge-sheet in the hand writing not by filling up the proforma and the summoning order carried on the order-sheet on printed proforma by itself cannot be said that the cognizance order was passed on printed proforma, therefore, in above circumstances, the law laid down by Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad in Pankaj Jaiswal Vs. State of U.P. and another 2021 0 Supreme (All) 491 (supra) is not applicable in this case. So far as argument of learned counsel for applicant regarding general allegations made in the first information report against applicant nos.1 & 2, from perusal of ruling of Hon’ble Supreme Court in ‘Geeta Mehrotra and another Vs. State of U.P. and another’ is concerned, in that case Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that name of the unmarried sister Kumari Geeta Mehrotra and elder brother Ram Ji were made casual and Hon’ble Supreme Court has quashed the proceeding against unmarried sister Geeta Mehrotra and younger brother of husband of victim Ram Ji Mehrotra as the F.I.R. does not disclose any material, which could be held to be constituted for offence against these two applicants and they proceeded against Geeta Mehrotra and Ram Ji Mehrotra, in above circumstances, was quashed. In this case, the first information report and the evidence collected during investigation disclosed active involvement of the applicant no.1 mother-in-law and applicant no.2 father-in-law. It is necessary to mention the fact that originally Amitesh Singh the husband of the victim was made as party and later on his name was deleted. This conduct also shows that the applicants have not come with clean hands before this Court. There is a specific and general allegations against the applicant nos.1 & 2 and her husband, whose name was later on deleted from the array of applicants, therefore, in above circumstances, it cannot be said that no specific and distinct allegations were levelled against the applicants, therefore, the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and others Vs. State of Bihar (supra) is not applicable in this case. This Court can exercise the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. sparingly. In this case as the cognizance order was passed on the charge- sheet and later on carried out on the order sheet, therefore, it cannot be said that the cognizance order was carried out on the printed proforma, therefore, it cannot be said that the order for taking cognizance was passed on printed proforma. Specific allegations were levelled against the applicants and her husband. The genuineness of the prosecution case cannot be adjudicated in the proceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C. From perusal of the first information report and statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., prima-facie offence under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and section ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act is made out against the applicants, therefore, in above circumstances, the prayer for quashing the entire criminal proceedings of the aforesaid case based on charge-sheet and its cognizance order is hereby refused. 11.         Accordingly, the instant application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. lacks merit and is dismissed.
Matter taken up in the revised list. No one appears on behalf of the revisionist. Notice was issued to the opposite party no. 2 vide order dated 11.5.2005. As per office report dated 01.8.2005, it is apparent that notice has been duly served personally on the opposite party no. 2. No one appears on behalf of the opposite party no. 2 even when the matter has been taken up in the revised list. Service of notice upon the opposite party no. 2 is thus sufficient. Sri Ankit Srivastava, learned State counsel is present. This revision is of year 2005. This Court, therefore, deems it fit to proceed in the matter on the basis of the record with the assistance of the learned State counsel. The present criminal revision under Section 397/401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as "Cr.P.C.") has been filed before this "It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may graciously be pleased to allow this revision and modify the judgement and order dated 1.4.2005 passed by Additional Sessions Judge (Court No. 9) Aligarh in Crl. Revision No. 797 of 2002 Yogesh Gautam vs. State of U.P. and other, to the extent of Rs. 1,000/- be granted to the son of Revisionist as per judgement and order dated 31.8.2002 passed by the trial court; otherwise the revisionist as well as her son shall suffer irreparable loss. It is further prayed that this Hon'ble Court may also be pleased to stay the effect and operation of the impugned judgement and order dated 1.4.2005 passed by Addl. Sessions Judge (Court No. 9) Aligarh in Crl. Revision No. 797 of 2002, Yogesh Gautam vs. State of U.P. and others, during the pendency of present revision before this Hon'ble Court so that justice may be done." Heard Sri Ankit Srivastava, learned State counsel and perused the material on record including the impugned order. Vide order dated 1.4.2005 the revisional court has modified the order dated 31.8.2002 to the extent that Rs. 1000/- per month be given to the revisionist and Rs. 400/- per month be given to her minor children from the date of order. The view as taken by the revisional court of granting Rs.1000/- per month to the revisionist and Rs. 400/- to her minor children the date of order is illegal. The Apex Court in the Case of Rajnesh Vs. Neha and another : Criminal Appeal No. 730 of 2020 (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) 9503 of 2018) decided on November 4, 2020 : 2020 SCC Online SC 903, in para-10, has held that the maintenance has to be awarded from the date of application. It has held as There is no provision in the HMA with respect to the date from which an Order of maintenance may be made effective. Similarly, Section 12 of the D.V. Act, does not provide the date from which the maintenance is to be awarded. Section 125(2) Cr.P.C. is the only statutory provision which provides that the Magistrate may award maintenance either from the date of the order, or from the date of application. [K. Sivaram vs. K. Mangalamba and others: 1989(1) In the absence of a uniform regime, there is a vast variance in the practice adopted by the Family Courts in the country, with respect to the date from which maintenance must be awarded. The divergent views taken by the Family Courts are : first, from the date on which the application for maintenance was filed; second, the date of the order granting maintenance; third, the date on which the summons was served upon the respondent. The view that maintenance ought to be granted from the date when the application was made, is based on the rationale that the primary object of maintenance laws is to protect a deserted wife and dependant children from destitution and vagrancy. If maintenance is not paid from the date of application, the party seeking maintenance would be deprived of sustenance, owing to the time taken for disposal of the application, which often runs into several years. The Orissa High Court in Susmita Mohanty v Rabindra Nath Sahu, 1996(I) OLR 361 held that the legislature intended to provide a summary, quick and comparatively inexpensive remedy to the neglected person. Where a litigation is prolonged, either on account of the conduct of the opposite party, or due to the heavy docket in Courts, or for unavoidable reasons, it would be unjust and contrary to the object of the provision, to provide maintenance from the date of the order. In Kanhu Charan Jena v. Smt. Nirmala Jena, 2001 Cri L.J. 879, the Orissa High Court was considering an application u/S. 125 Cr.P.C., wherein it was held that even though the decision to award maintenance either from the date of application, or from the date of order, was within the discretion of the Court, it would be appropriate to grant maintenance from the date of application. This was followed in Arun Kumar Nayak v Urmila Jena, (2010) 93 AIC 726 (Ori) wherein it was reiterated that dependents were entitled to receive maintenance from the date of application. The Madhya Pradesh High Court in Krishna Jain v Dharam Raj Jain, 1993 (2) MPJR 63 held that a wife may set up a claim for maintenance to be granted from the date of application, and the husband may deny it. In such cases, the Court may frame an issue, and decide the same based on evidence led by parties. The view that the "normal rule" was to grant maintenance from the date of order, and the exception was to grant maintenance from the date of application, would be to insert something more in Section 125(2)Cr.P.C., which the Legislature did not intend. Reasons must be recorded in both cases. i.e. when maintenance is awarded from the date of application, or when it is awarded from the date of order. The law governing payment of maintenance u/S. 125 Cr.P.C. from the date of application, was extended to HAMA by the Allahabad High Court in Ganga Prasad Srivastava v Additional District Judge, Gonda & Ors.51 The Court held that the date of application should always be regarded as the starting point for payment of maintenance. The Court was considering a suit for maintenance u/S. 18 of HAMA, wherein the Civil Judge directed that maintenance be paid from the date of judgment. The High Court held that the normal inference should be that the order of maintenance would be effective from the date of application. A party seeking maintenance would otherwise be deprived of maintenance due to the delay in disposal of the application, which may arise due to paucity of time of the Court, or on account of the conduct of one of the parties. In this case, there was a delay of seven years in disposing of the suit, and the wife could not be made to starve till such time. The wife was held to be entitled to maintenance from the date of application / suit. The Delhi High Court in Lavlesh Shukla v Rukmani, Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 851/2019, decided by the Delhi High Court vide order dated 29.11.2019, held that where the wife is unemployed and is incurring expenses towards maintaining herself and the minor child / children, she is entitled to receive maintenance from the date of application. Maintenance is awarded to a wife to overcome the financial crunch, which occurs on account of her separation from her husband. It is neither a matter of favour to the wife, nor any charity done by the husband. The second view that maintenance ought to be awarded from the date of order is based on the premise that the general rule is to award maintenance from the date of order, and grant of maintenance from the date of application must be the exception. The foundation of this view is based on the interpretation of Section "(2) Any such allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance and expenses for proceeding shall be payable from the date of the order, or, if so ordered, from the date of the application for maintenance or interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be." The words "or, if so ordered" in Section 125 has been interpreted to mean that where the court is awarding maintenance from the date of application, special reasons ought to be recorded. [Bina Devi & Ors. v State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. (2010) 69 ACC 19]In Bina Devi v State of U.P., (2010) 69 ACC 19, the Allahabad High Court on an interpretation of S.125(2) of the Cr.P.C. held that when maintenance is directed to be paid from the date of application, the Court must record reasons. If the order is silent, it will be effective from the date of the order, for which reasons need not be recorded. The Court held that Section 125(2) Cr.P.C. is prima facie clear that maintenance shall be payable from the date of the order. The Madhya Pradesh High Court in Amit Verma v Sangeeta Verma & Ors. C.R.R. No. 3542/2019 decided by the Madhya Pradesh High Court vide Order dated 08.1.2020, directed that maintenance ought to be granted from the date of the order. The third view followed by some Courts is that maintenance ought to be granted from the date of service of summons upon the respondent. The Kerala High Court in S. Radhakumari v K.M.K. Nair, AIR 1983 Ker 139, was considering an application for interim maintenance preferred by the wife in divorce proceedings filed by the husband. The High Court held that maintenance must be awarded to the wife from the date on which summons were served in the main divorce petition. The Court relied upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Samir Banerjee v Sujata Banerjee, 70 CWN 633, and held that Section 24 of the HMA does not contain any provision that maintenance must be awarded from a specific date. The Court may, in exercise of its discretion, award maintenance from the date of service of summons. The Orissa High Court in Gouri Das v Pradyumna Kumar Das, 1986 (II) OLR 44, was considering an application for interim maintenance filed u/S. 24 HMA by the wife, in a divorce petition instituted by the husband. The Court held that the ordinary rule is to award maintenance from the date of service of summons. It was held that in cases where the applicant in the maintenance petition is also the petitioner in the divorce petition, maintenance becomes payable from the date when summons is served upon the respondent in the main proceeding. In Kalpana Das v Sarat Kumar Das, AIR 2009 Ori 133, the Orissa High Court held that the wife was entitled to maintenance from the date when the husband entered appearance. The Court was considering an application for interim maintenance u/S. 24 HMA in a petition for restitution of conjugal rights filed by the wife. The Family Court awarded interim maintenance to the wife and minor child from the date of the order. In an appeal filed by the wife and minor child seeking maintenance from the date of application, the High Court held that the Family Court had failed to assign any reasons in support of its order, and "9. …Learned Judge. Family Court has not assigned any reason as to why he passed the order of interim maintenance w.e.f. the date of order. When admittedly the parties are living separately and prima facie it appears that the Petitioners have no independent source of income, therefore, in our view order should have been passed for payment of interim maintenance from the date of The judgments hereinabove reveal the divergent views of different High Courts on the date from which maintenance must be awarded. Even though a judicial discretion is conferred upon the Court to grant maintenance either from the date of application or from the date of the order in S. 125(2) Cr.P.C., it would be appropriate to grant maintenance from the date of application in all cases, including Section 125 Cr.P.C. In the practical working of the provisions relating to maintenance, we find that there is significant delay in disposal of the applications for interim maintenance for years on end. It would therefore be in the interests of justice and fair play that maintenance is awarded from the date of the application. In Shail Kumari Devi and Ors. v Krishnan Bhagwan Pathak, (2008) 9 SCC 632, this Court held that the entitlement of maintenance should not be left to the uncertain date of disposal of the case. The enormous delay in disposal of proceedings justifies the award of maintenance from the date of application. In Bhuwan Mohan Singh v Meena, (2015) 6 SCC 353, this Court held that repetitive adjournments sought by the husband in that case resulted in delay of 9 years in the adjudication of the case. The delay in adjudication was not only against human rights, but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an individual. The delay in the conduct of the proceedings would require grant of maintenance to date back to the date of application. The rationale of granting maintenance from the date of application finds its roots in the object of enacting maintenance legislations, so as to enable the wife to overcome the financial crunch which occurs on separation from the husband. Financial constraints of a dependant spouse hampers their capacity to be effectively represented before the Court. In order to prevent a dependant from being reduced to destitution, it is necessary that maintenance is awarded from the date on which the application for maintenance is filed before the concerned In Badshah v Urmila Badshah Godse (2014) 1 SCC 188, the Supreme Court was considering the interpretation of Section 125 Cr.P.C. The Court held : "13.3. …purposive interpretation needs to be given to the provisions of Section 125 CrPC. While dealing with the application of a destitute wife or hapless children or parents under this provision, the Court is dealing with the marginalised sections of the society. The purpose is to achieve "social justice" which is the constitutional vision, enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution of India. The Preamble to the Constitution of India clearly signals that we have chosen the democratic path under the rule of law to achieve the goal of securing for all its citizens, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. It specifically highlights achieving their social justice. Therefore, it becomes the bounden duty of the courts to advance the cause of the social justice. While giving interpretation to a particular provision, the court is supposed to bridge the gap It has therefore become necessary to issue directions to bring about uniformity and consistency in the Orders passed by all Courts, by directing that maintenance be awarded from the date on which the application was made before the concerned Court. The right to claim maintenance must date back to the date of filing the application, since the period during which the maintenance proceedings remained pending is not within the control of the applicant." Looking to the facts of the case and the the legal proposition as laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Rajnesh (Supra), the present criminal revision is partly allowed. The judgement and order dated 1.4.2005 passed by Additional Sessions Judge (Court No. 9) Aligarh in Crl. Revision No. 797 of 2002 Yogesh Gautam vs. State of U.P. and other, is set aside, in so far as it issues a direction for payment of maintenance from the date of order. The opposite party no. 2/Yogesh Gautam is directed to pay a sum of Rs.1000/- per month to the revisionist and Rs. 400/- to her minor children, from the date of application. The payment shall be done within a period of six months. The arrears of payment to be paid within six months from today in three equal instalment, the first instalment of which shall be paid within a period of one month from today and the remaining two instalment shall be paid within equally divided in the remaining time. Lower court record be sent to the court concerned forthwith. Office is directed to communicate this Court to the court concerned within two weeks from today.
1.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 14.08.2019 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 50530 of 2019, by which the High Court has allowed the said bail to respondent No.2 herein – accused, the original informant – complainant has preferred the present appeal. 2. That first information report came to be filed by the appellant herein against respondent No.2 with Chapra Town Police Station, Saran in case No.453 of 2018 for the offences punishable under sections 406, 407, 468, 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. A warrant of arrest came to be issued by learned    Chief  Judicial    Magistrate,   Saran,   Chapra    on 19.12.2018. It appears that thereafter respondent No.2 – accused is absconding and concealing himself to avoid service of  warrant    of arrest.  Thereafter   learned   Chief  Judicial Magistrate issued a proclamation against respondent No.2 under section 82 Cr.PC. Only thereafter and issuance of proclamation under section 82 Cr.PC, respondent No.2 – accused filed anticipatory bail application before learned Trial Court. By a detailed order dated 29.01.2019 the learned Trial Court dismissed the said anticipatory bail application and rejected the prayer for anticipatory bail on merits as well as on the ground that as the accused is absconding and even the proceedings under section 82/83 Cr.PC have been issued, the accused is not entitled to the anticipatory bail. That thereafter the accused approached the High Court by way of present application and despite the fact that it was specifically pointed to the High Court that since the process of proclamation under section 82 & 83 Cr.PC have been issued, the accused should not be allowed the privilege of anticipatory bail, ignoring the aforesaid relevant aspect, by the impugned judgment and order the High Court has allowed the said anticipatory bail by observing that in the event of his arrest/surrender within six weeks in the Court below, he may be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/­ with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Saran, Chapra and subject to the conditions as laid­ down under section 438 (2) of Cr.PC. 3. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused, the original informant/complainant – appellant has preferred the present appeal. 4. Shri Rituraj Biswas, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has committed a grave error in allowing the anticipatory bail application. 4.1 It is submitted that considering the fact that the accused was avoiding    the  arrest  and   even   did  not   co­operate  with investigating agency and even after the arrest warrants were issued, the proceedings under sections 82­83 of Cr.PC were initiated, the High Court ought not to allow the anticipatory bail application. 4.2 It is submitted that though the factum of initiation of proceedings under Section 82­83 of Cr.PC was pointed out, the High Court has simply ignored the same. 4.3 It is further submitted that even the High Court has not at all considered the seriousness of the offences alleged namely the offences under sections 406, 420 of IPC, which were in detail considered by the learned Trial Court while rejecting the anticipatory bail application. 4.4 It is submitted that the High Court has granted the anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 solely observing that the nature of accusation arising out of a business transaction. It is submitted that merely because it was a business transaction, without further considering the nature of allegations the High Court ought not to have granted the anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused. 4.5 Relying upon the decision of this court in case of State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Pradeep Sharma reported in (2014) 2 SCC 171, it is submitted that as observed and held by this court a person against whom the proclamation has been issued and the proceedings under sections 82­83 of Cr.PC have been initiated, is not entitled to the benefit of anticipatory bail. 4.6 It is further submitted that even subsequently a charge­sheet has been filed against the accused – respondent No.2 for the offences punishable under sections 406 and 420 of IPC. 4.7 Making the above submissions and relying upon above decision of this court, it is prayed to allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused. 5.  Shri Devashish Bharuka, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the State has supported the appellant and has submitted that on being found a prima facie case against respondent No.2 – accused, a charge­sheet has been filed against the accused under sections 406 and 420 of IPC also. 6.  Shri Abhishek, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No.2 has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has not committed any error in granting anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused. 6.1 It is submitted that the High Court has rightly observed that the nature of accusation is arising out of a business transaction. It is submitted that merely because the cheque was given and the same came to be dishonored it cannot be said that the offences under sections 406 and 420 of IPC is made out. It is submitted that at the most the case may fall under section 138 of 6.2 It is submitted that as such respondent No.2 – accused was available for interrogation and therefore there is no question of absconding. 6.3 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.2 – accused that at this stage only the charge­sheet has been filed in the court, but the learned Magistrate has yet to take cognizance of the same. 7.  We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant – original informant ­ complainant as well as learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State and the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.2­ accused. 7.1 It is required to be noted that after investigation a charge­sheet has been filed against respondent no.2 – accused for the offences punishable under sections 406, 420 of IPC also. Thus it has been found that there is a prima facie case against the accused. It has come on record that the arrest warrant was issued by the learned Magistrate as far as back on 19.12.2018 and thereafter proceedings under sections 82­83 of Cr.PC have been initiated pursuant to the order passed by the learned Chief Judicial   Magistrate    dated    10.01.2019.    Only  thereafter respondent No.2 moved an application before the learned Trial Court for anticipatory bail which came to be dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Saran, by a reasoned order. The relevant observations made by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Saran, while rejecting the anticipatory bail “Perused the record. The prosecution case as alleged in the typed application of the informant Prem Shankar Prasad is that the informant is a retailer shopkeeper of medicines in the name of Maa Medical Store, Gandhi Chauk, Chapra and the petitioner is his stockiest who runs his business in the name of Rajnish Pharma, Mauna Pakari. The petitioner and the informant were on good terms, so, the informant gave Rs. 36,00,000/­ to the petitioner in case and through cheque for purchase of medicine. When the required were not supplied to the informant, the informant demanded his Rs. 36,00,000/­ then, the petitioner gave a cheque of Rs. 10,00,000/­ bearing cheque no. 137763 dated 25.11.2017 which was in the Canara Bank of the petitioner which was dishonored by the bank with a note "insufficient fund". Thereafter the informant demanded his money in case. On 20.06.18 but, the brothers of the petitioner misbehaved with the informant. The brothers of the petitioner also threatened not to contact the police or the consequences will be worst: On this informant Chapra Town PS No. 453/2018 was registered and investigation proceeded. Perused the case diary from which it transpires that in para 4 there is a re­statement of the informant in which he has supported the prosecution case. In para 8, 9, 10, and 11 witness Kumar and Uday Shankar Prasad has been examined under section 161 of Cr.PC in which they have supported the prosecution case. In para 16 there is supervision note of SDPO, Sadar in which prosecution case. In found true under sections 420, 406 of IPC and 138 of NI Act. In para 23 processes under sections 82 and 83 of Cr.PC have been issued against the petitioner in para 38 there is a statement of witness Ashutosh Mishra who is a medical representative and has stated that Rajnish Srivastava, being stockiest of the medicine used to sell the medicines of his company in course whereof he has borrowed a sum of Rs. 7,10,000/­ from him. When he asked to return back the money he has issued a cheque of the aforesaid amount which was dishonor by his bank due to insufficient fund. In para 39 another witness Pramod Kumar Thakur has been examined who has deposed that this petitioner Rajnish Srivastava has borrowed a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/­ on the pretext of purchasing a piece of land. When he demanded his money back. Rajnish Srivastava gave a cheque of the aforesaid amount which was dishonored by the bank. The investigation in the case is still going on. From perusal of the case record I find that the informant has alleged to have given a sum of Rs. 36,00,000/­ to this petitioner in order to supply certain medicines which was neither supplied nor the amount was ever refunded. Admittedly, the said amount was given to the petitioner on an oral undertaking as there is nothing on record to substantiate the aforesaid averments, but, the fact remains that the petitioner in order to refund the said   amount      has    issued  a    cheque     of Rs.10,00,000/­ bearing cheque no. 137763 dated 25.11.2017 which was deposed by the informant in the bank, but, the same was dishonored with record I further find that the petitioner is in the habit of borrowing money from different persons and then used to make default in payment inasmuch as by issuing cheques without sufficient balance in his account which transpires form paras 38 and 39 of the case diary.” 7.2 Despite the above observations on merits and despite the fact that it was brought to the notice of the High Court that respondent No.2 – accused is absconding and even the proceedings under sections 82­83 of Cr.PC have been initiated as far as back on 10.01.2019, the High Court has just ignored the aforesaid relevant aspects and has granted anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused by observing that the nature of accusation is arising out of a business transaction. The specific allegations of cheating, etc., which came to be considered by learned Additional Sessions Judge has not at all been considered by the High Court. Even the High Court has just ignored the factum of initiation of proceedings under sections 82­83 of Cr.PC by simply observing that “be that as it may”. The aforesaid relevant aspect on grant of anticipatory bail ought not to have been ignored by the High Court and ought to have been considered by the High Court very seriously and not casually. 7.3 In the case of State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Pradeep Sharma (Supra), it is observed and held by this court that if anyone is declared as an absconder/proclaimed offender in terms of section 82 of Cr.PC, he is not entitled to relief of anticipatory bail. In paragraph 14 to 16, it is observed and held as under:­ “14. In order to answer the above question, it is desirable to refer to Section 438 of the Code which “438. Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest.—(1) Where any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on accusation of having committed a non­bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section that in the event of such arrest he shall be released on bail; and that court may, after taking into consideration, inter alia, the following (i) the nature and gravity of the accusation; (ii) the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether he has previously undergone imprisonment on conviction by a court in respect of any cognizable offence; (iii) the possibility of the applicant to flee (iv) where the accusation has been made with the object of injuring or humiliating the applicant by having him so arrested, either reject the application forthwith or issue an interim order for the grant of Provided that, where the High Court or, as the case may be, the Court of Session, has not passed any interim order under this sub­ section or has rejected the application for grant of anticipatory bail, it shall be open to an officer in charge of a police station to arrest, without warrant the applicant on the basis of the accusation apprehended in such application.” The above provision makes it clear that the power exercisable under Section 438 of the Code is somewhat extraordinary in character and it is to be exercised only in exceptional cases where it appears that the person may be falsely implicated or where there are reasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an offence is not likely to otherwise misuse his liberty. 15. In Adri Dharan Das v. State of W.B. [(2005) 4 SCC 303] this Court considered the scope of Section 438 of the Code as under : (SCC pp. 311­12, para 16) “16. Section 438 is a procedural provision which is concerned with the personal liberty of an individual who is entitled to plead innocence, since he is not on the date of application for exercise of power under Section 438 of the Code convicted for the offence in respect of which he seeks bail. The applicant must show that he has ‘reason to believe’ that he may be arrested in a non­ bailable offence. Use of the expression ‘reason to believe’ shows that the belief that the applicant may be arrested must be founded on reasonable grounds. Mere ‘fear’ is not ‘belief’ for which reason it is not enough for the applicant to show that he has some sort of vague apprehension that someone is going to make an accusation against him in pursuance of which he may be arrested. Grounds on which the belief of the applicant is based that he may be arrested in non­bailable offence must be capable of being examined. If an application is made to the High Court or the Court of Session, it is for the court concerned to decide whether a case has been made out for granting of the relief sought. The provisions cannot be invoked after arrest of the accused. A blanket order should not be generally passed. It flows from the very language of the section which requires the applicant to show that he has reason to believe that he may be arrested. A belief can be said to be founded on reasonable grounds only if there is something tangible to go by on the basis of which it can be said that the applicant's apprehension that he may be arrested is genuine. Normally a direction should not issue to the effect that the applicant shall be released on bail ‘whenever arrested for whichever offence whatsoever’. Such ‘blanket order’ should not be passed as it would serve as a blanket to cover or protect any and every kind of allegedly unlawful activity. An order under Section 438 is a device to secure the individual's liberty, it is neither a passport to the commission of crimes nor a shield against any and all kinds of accusations likely or unlikely. On the facts of the case, considered in the background of the legal position set out above, this does not prima facie appear to be a case where any order in terms of Section 438 of the Code can be passed.” 16. Recently, in Lavesh v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2012) 8 SCC 730] , this Court (of which both of us were parties) considered the scope of granting relief under Section 438 vis­à­vis a person who was declared as an absconder or proclaimed offender in terms of Section 82 of the Code. In para 12, this Court held as “12. From these materials and information, it is clear that the present appellant was not available for interrogation and investigation and was declared as ‘absconder’. Normally, when the accused is ‘absconding’ and declared as a ‘proclaimed offender’, there is no question of granting anticipatory bail. We reiterate that when a person against whom a warrant had been issued and is absconding or concealing himself in order to avoid execution of warrant and declared as a proclaimed offender in terms of Section 82 of the Code he is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail.” It is clear from the above decision that if anyone is declared as an absconder/proclaimed offender in terms of Section 82 of the Code, he is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail.” Thus the High court has committed an error in granting anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused ignoring the proceedings under Section 82­83 of Cr.PC. 8. Even the observations made by the High Court while granting the anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused that the nature of accusation is arising out of a business transaction and therefore the accused is entitled to the anticipatory bail is concerned, the same cannot be accepted. Even in the case of a business transaction also there may be offences under the IPC more particularly sections 406, 420, 467, 468, etc. What is required to be considered is the nature of allegation and the accusation and not that the nature of accusation is arising out of a business transaction. At this stage, it is required to be noted that respondent No.2 ­ accused has been charge­sheeted for the offences punishable under sections 406 and 420, etc. and a charge­sheet has been filed in the court of learned 9. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and order dated 14.08.2019 passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to respondent No.2 – accused is un­sustainable and deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. However, two weeks’ time from the date of pronouncement of this judgment is granted to respondent No.2 to surrender before the concerned Trial Court and thereafter it will be open for respondent No.2 – accused to pray for regular bail, which may be considered in accordance with law and on its own merits. The present appeal is accordingly allowed in the aforesaid terms.
2.          This appeal challenges the judgment and order dated 29.9.2021 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru, dismissing Writ Petition No. 53944/2016 (GM-Res) preferred by the appellant herein. Said writ petition had prayed, inter alia, for following reliefs: - (A)  “Issue appropriate writs, orders or directions Digitally signed by directing the Respondents to produce mercy files Reason:                       pertaining to the Petitioner, all the relevant papers and correspondence pertaining to the Petitioner’s mercy petition, for the perusal of the Court since the Petitioner has been able to show a grave, and unexceptionable delay in such processes as undertaken by the Respondents. (B)  Issue appropriate writs, orders or directions directing production of medical file of the Petitioner from prison from the date of his arrest. (C)  Issue appropriate writs, orders or directions and in particular a writ of Declaration, declaring that the execution of the sentence of death on the Petitioner (as communicated through letter dated 15.05.2013 - F.No.14/1/2011-Judicial Cell, Annexure N hereto) pursuant to the rejection of his mercy petition by the office of the Hon’ble President of India is unconstitutional and bad in law. (D) Issue appropriate writs, orders or directions commuting the death sentence of the Petitioner to imprisonment for life. (E)  Declare that the decision of the office of the Hon’ble President of India rejecting the mercy petition filed by the Petitioner is illegal, void and unenforceable; (F)  Declare that the decision of the office of the Hon’ble Governor of Karnataka rejecting the mercy petition filed by the Petitioner is illegal, void and (G) Quash and set aside the order of President of India rejecting the mercy petition filed by the Petitioner; (H) Quash and set aside the order of the Governor of Karnataka rejecting the mercy petition filed by the (I)  Grant inspection of the documents mentioned in (A) and (B) to the Petitioner; (J)  Issue any such other writs, orders and directions as this Hon’ble Court deems fit in the facts and circumstances of the case in the interest of justice and equity. 3.   The basic facts leading to the filing of said Writ Petition are (a)    One Jayashri, wife of Maradi Subbaiah was found raped and murdered in her home on 28.02.1998, which led to the registration of Crime No. 108/1998 with Division, Bengaluru City. The appellant was arrested in connection with said crime on 2.3.1998 and has been in custody since then. After due investigation, the appellant was tried in Sessions Case No. 725/1999 on the file of Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court-VII, Bengaluru for having committed offences punishable under Sections 302, 376 and 392 of the Indian Penal (b)    By its judgment dated 26.10.2006, the trial Court convicted the appellant for the aforesaid offences and by order dated 27.10.2006, awarded punishment of death sentence, subject to confirmation by the High Court. The appellant was immediately transferred to Belgaum    Central   Prison   and   according   to   the appellant, he was kept in solitary confinement. (c)      Case for confirmation of death sentence was registered as Criminal Reference No. 3/2006 before the High Court. The appellant also filed Criminal Appeal No. 2408/2006 challenging his conviction. The matter was heard by a Bench of two Judges, which confirmed the order of conviction, but disagreed on the sentence to be imposed. While Mr. Justice V.G. Sabhahit confirmed the award of death sentence, Mr. Justice R.B. Naik commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment. (d)      The matter was therefore referred to the third Judge i.e., Mr. Justice S.R. Bannurmath on the issue of sentence, who affirmed the award of death sentence by his judgment dated 18.2.2009. (e)      The matter was carried further by the appellant by filing Criminal Appeal Nos. 285-286/2011 before this Court, which were dismissed by this Court vide order dated 1.2.20112, affirming the appellant’s conviction and sentence of death imposed upon him. B.A. Umesh v. High Court of Karnataka, (2011) 3 SCC 85. (f) According to the procedure governing petitions for mercy in death sentence cases, a death convict can prefer a petition for mercy within seven (7) days after the dismissal of his appeal by this Court or rejection of application for special leave to appeal. The relevant instructions in that behalf read as under: - “I.    A convict under sentence of death shall be allowed, if he has not already submitted a petition for mercy, for the preparation and submission of a petition for mercy, seven days after, and exclusive of, the date on which the Superintendent of Jail informs him of the dismissal by the Supreme Court of his appeal or of his application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. Provided that in cases where no appeal to the Supreme Court, has been preferred or no application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been lodged, the said period of seven days shall be computed from the date next after the date on which the period allowed for an appeal to the Supreme Court or for lodging an application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court expires. (g) Having been informed about his right to file a mercy petition as per procedure, the appellant preferred a petition seeking mercy on 8.2.2011, i.e., within seven days.     The appellant also preferred Review Petition against the decision dated 1.2.2011 passed by this Court. Around the same time, Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 52/2011 was preferred by the appellant in this Court praying, inter alia, for the relief of open Court hearing in review petition. In said writ petition, this Court by order dated 9.3.2011, directed stay of execution of death sentence. The Review Petition filed by the appellant was dismissed by circulation by this Court vide its order dated 7.9.2011. (h)      Mercy petition preferred by the appellant was rejected by the Hon’ble President on 12.5.2013. An intimation in that behalf was sent vide letter dated 15.5.2013 to the appellant. (i)      Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 52/2011 preferred by the appellant was decided alongwith Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 77/2014 (Mohd.        Arif  @ Ashfaq       vs. Registrar General, Supreme Court of India & Ors.) by a Constitution Bench of this Court vide judgment dated 2.9.20143. It was held by majority that review petitions arising out of award of death sentence be heard in open Court by a Bench of three Judges of this Court. (j)     Consequently, the Review Petition which was rejected earlier on 7.9.2011, was listed for re-hearing before a Bench of three Judges of this Court, which by its order dated 3.10.20164, dismissed the Review Petition and affirmed the award of death sentence. The order stated that on careful comparison of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and keeping in view the principles of law laid down by this Court, the Court was not inclined to allow the Review Petition or modify the order dated 1.2.2011. (k)     Within    few   days    thereafter, Writ    Petition No. 53944/2016 was preferred by the appellant seeking reliefs as extracted hereinabove. The High Court by its order dated 20.10.2016, stayed execution of death sentence imposed upon the appellant.          Thereafter, statements of objections were preferred on behalf of the Union of India and State of Karnataka, to which rejoinders were filed. An application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was also preferred to bring on record certain documents regarding medical condition of the appellant. 4.   By its judgment and order dated 29.9.2021, the High Court dismissed the aforesaid writ petition. After considering the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, the following conclusions were arrived at by the High Court: - “(i)  There is no excessive, unexplained, inordinate delay attributable to the respondents in deciding the mercy (ii)  There is no violation of the petitioner’s right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India; (iii) All the relevant and crucial materials required for deciding the mercy petition were placed before His Excellency, the Governor and His Excellency, the President of India and nothing has been kept out of (iv) Petitioner cannot be said to have been kept in solitary confinement.” 5.   In the challenge raised in the instant matter, while issuing notice, the order dated 31.1.2022 passed by this Court noted the submissions on behalf of the appellants as under: - “a)   Even after recording a finding that there was avoidable delay to the extent of 550 days in disposing of the mercy petition, the High Court did not grant any relief to the petitioner. b)    Going by the letter written by a Medical Officer, which letter was not controverted, the petitioner was kept in solitary confinement for about 11 years. Thus, the law laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration & Others5 was violated. c)   The letter written by the Medical Officer was quite clear that because of the psychological condition, the petitioner was unable to make any mercy petition. This fact was also not taken into account in correct perspective by the High Court.” By said order, this Court also called for certain documents as “a.  The State shall place before us the Report(s) of all the Probation Officer(s) relating to the accused before the next date of hearing. In case there have been more than one Report, let all Reports be placed for the consideration of this Court. b.   Since the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) at Bengaluru, has on the earlier occasion made psychological assessment of the petitioner, the Director NIMHANS is directed to constitute a suitable team for psychological evaluation of the petitioner and send a Report before the next date of hearing. c.   The Jail Authorities, Belgaum Central Prison where the petitioner is presently lodged shall render complete co- operation in facilitating access to and due evaluation of the petitioner in all respects.” 6.       When the matter was taken up on 21.4.2022, after noting the submission advanced on behalf of the appellant that the appellant had been kept in solitary confinement right from the decision of the Sessions Court, directions were issued to the District Judge, Belgaum to cause an inspection to be undertaken and submit a report. The text of the order was as under: - “The basic submissions raised on behalf of the petitioner were recorded in the order dated 31.01.2022. While elaborating those submissions, Dr. Yug Mohit Chaudhry, learned advocate, has stressed the point that the petitioner was kept in solitary confinement right from the decision of the Sessions Court awarding him death sentence. Our attention is invited to various documents including the Prison Manual in support of the submission that, as the petitioner was segregated and kept in a separate Cell, that would amount to solitary confinement, in terms of the law laid down in Sunil Batra Etc. vs Delhi Administration and The submission is opposed on behalf of the State Government and though no specific reply was filed in the High Court controverting the basic allegations in the writ petition, Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned AAG for the State, on instructions, submits that video conferencing can be arranged so that this Court can have clear knowledge about the circumstances in which the petitioner has been lodged in a Cell. It is true that the Hon’ble Judges constituting the Bench in Sunil Batra’s5 case had visited the jail premises themselves in order to have first-hand knowledge about the conditions in which said petitioner was lodged. We may at this stage rely upon the local inspection to be conducted by the District Judge, Belgaum who also holds the charge as the Chairman of the District Legal Services Committee, Belgaum. We therefore, direct the District Judge, Belgaum to cause local inspection done by himself and place a report alongwith pictures, if any, to enable us have a clear understanding of the ground situation. The report shall concentrate on location of the barracks in which the cells of Death Row Convicts are situated. It is made clear that the Cells which are close to the gallows and are used for keeping persons about to be executed, are different from the Cells for the Death Row Convicts. The inspection shall cover issues whether the inmates of the concerned cells are allowed to intermingle with fellow prisoners, the way the meals are served to them and the duration for which the inmates are allowed to come out of their individual cells. These are only illustrative pointers. What we want to gather is the typical life-style of Death Row Convicts and how their days are spent. Let the report be made as early as possible and latest by The report shall be sent through electronic mode at the following Email id.: vc2.appearance@sci.nic.in. Let copy of this order be sent through electronic mode to the District Judge, Belgaum. To our specific query as to the manner in which the Mercy Petition of the petitioner was processed, Ms. Sonia Mathur, learned Senior Advocate appearing for Union of India has placed the concerned file for our perusal. The Registry is directed to make copies of the file and return the same to the concerned advocate on record by tomorrow.” 7.   Accordingly, report dated 21.4.2022 has been placed on record by Principal District & Sessions Judge, Belgaum alongwith picture photograph(s) of the concerned Jail barracks and the cells. The Report is as under: - 1. “As per the directions, I visited Central Prison, Hindalaga at 2.15 p.m. without prior notice to the Jail Authorities. 2. The concerned barrack wherein the death convict Sri B A Umesh is housed is on the North-Eastern side facing East in the Central Prison Hindalga. There are six cells each measuring 8x10 feet approximately. Each cell has a toilet in the corner with an adequate water facility. Each of the prisoners is given a flat mattress and they are at liberty to have their own bedding. There is electric light in each of the cells which can be put on at their wish and they have one window facing towards the West. The cells are covered with grill doors and adequate light and air is available. These six cells are of tiled roof. Encircling the six cells, there is guard room and another common toilet outside within the compound. Even in the compound of the barrack, there is a facility for washing of the clothes etc. It was informed that prison also has R.O. Water facility which would be provided in plastic pots. 3. Out of these six cells, five are occupied. In one of the cells, there are four persons involved in an offence of kidnapping, robbery, and murder. They are Siddhalingesh, Suraj, Akshay and Jameer. In another cell, there are two occupants viz., Sameer and Shakib, who are involved in offence under Section 307 of IPC. Another cell is occupied by Balu involved in a murder case. They are all under trial prisoners. 4. The Remaining two cells are occupied by one person each i.e, Akash Desai convicted for offence under NDPS Act for 10 years. Southern most cell is occupied by death convict Shri. B.A. Umesh. They informed that they are in the said cells for the last 3 months to 8 years. The other 26 death convicts are in other barracks including high security barrack, women barrack and a hospital. 5. The inmates of the cell informed that they are unlocked from the cells at about 6.00 a.m. They are allowed to wander in the compound of the barrack. The barrack is guarded by five guards and it was informed that they are free to wash their clothes and take bath outside and sit under the trees in the compound. There is also hospital block in the prison and if necessary, they will be escorted to the hospital where there is a Medical Officer available. Hospital also has inpatient facilities and mini laboratory is also adjoining it. The inmates also told me that they can talk to fellow prisoners and there are no restrictions during daytime. The cells will be locked again at 6.00 p.m. in the evening. 6. It is informed that breakfast is served at about 7.30 in the morning, lunch will be served at about 11.00 a.m. and supper would be served at 4.30 p.m. The inmates are free to consume the supper at any time they find it convenient and they can eat sitting together. All the inmates including Shri. B.A. Umesh informed that the quality of food is good and adequate. It was informed by the jail authorities that a minimum of five guards are posted in the barrack on a rotation basis. 7. It was also informed that in one of the cells there is a TV fixed which may be seen by all the inmates together. 8. It was also informed that prisoners are at liberty to purchase bakery items which are prepared by the inmates and sold in the prison itself. It was informed that the prisoners purchase the bakery items out of the earnings made by them. 9. Adjoining the said barrack of six cells, on the northern side, there is a gate leading to the gallows. There is no separate cell meant for death convict, who would be kept in the cell before he is taken to the gallows. 10. Thus it is observed that the cells have adequate light, air, drinking water facilities, a common facility to view TV, and adequate water for bathing and washing of the clothes. The cells are enclosed in a separate compound within the prison. They can move around the cells freely between 6.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. 11. The photographs and videos of the cells are attached with this report for kind perusal.” 8.   On the subsequent date, the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant were discussed in the order dated 26.4.2022 as “The Principal District and Sessions Judge, Belagavi has placed on record his Report dated 21.04.2022. Copies of the Report have been furnished to the parties. Dr. Yug Mohit Chaudhry, learned advocate submits that since the last date of hearing, the counsel for the petitioner have had interactions with the petitioner. Dr. Chaudhry fairly accepts that whatever is stated in the Report corresponds to the instructions received from the petitioner and that the Report depicts true state of affairs in the concerned Barrack and the Cell. He, however submits that the petitioner was kept in what is commonly called “Andheri Block” in Belagavi Prison from 2006 to October, 2016 i.e. till stay was granted by the High Court to the execution of death sentence. It is submitted that there are 12 Cells in that Block and only one prisoner is kept in a Cell; the petitioner was not allowed to get out of his Cell at any time during the entire length of stay except for 2 Yoga sessions which were conducted and one function where inmates were allowed to offer prayers to Lord Ayyappa. In his submission that was the worst period of his stay inside the prison and the imprisonment in the Cell in “Andheri Block” can certainly be said to be “Solitary confinement” as described in Sunil Batra Etc. vs Delhi Administration and Ors. Etc.5. Dr. Chaudhry further submits that after October, 2016 till January, 2019 the petitioner was lodged in same “Andheri Block” but was allowed to come out of the Cell thrice a day and after January, 2019 he was shifted to the present Barrack with respect to which the Report has been made. We have also had the benefit of interaction with the concerned Jail Superintendent who is present in Court. He has accepted that the petitioner was kept in “Andheri Block” till January, 2019. He has also accepted that only one inmate is kept in a cell in said “Andheri Block”. It is however, stated that all the inmates are allowed to come out of their cells thrice a day for the duration of 2-3 hours each. It is submitted that they are taken out at about 6.30 A.M. in the morning and are re-lodged after the breakfast, again to be taken out for the purposes of lunch and supper and are finally re-lodged around 5.00 P.M.            In sum and substance, according to him, the inmates are allowed to come out of their Cells for about 6 hours everyday. It is further stated that the petitioner was shifted to the present Barrack in January, 2019 by his predecessor and since then the petitioner has been confined in the present Barrack in circumstances described in the Report. Thereafter, submissions were advanced by Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned AAG for the State and Ms. Sonia Mathur, learned Senior Advocate for Union of India. After conclusion of their submissions, Dr. Chaudhry made his submissions in rejoinder.…..” 9.   We heard Dr. Yug Mohit Chaudhry, learned advocate assisted by Ms. Payoshi Roy, learned advocate for the appellant, Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned Additional Advocate General for the State and Ms. Sonia Mathur, learned Senior Advocate for Union of India. After conclusion of submissions, the matter was reserved for 10. The parties thereafter filed written submissions and, in the submissions filed on behalf of the appellant, the challenge has principally been raised on two grounds: (i) delay in deciding mercy petition and (ii) the Solitary Confinement that the appellant was subjected to. On the first issue, following chart has been placed on “Chunks of Unexplained Delay 1.     3.3.11   The Central Government forwards      No explanation for why it took 1 the mercy petition to the State      year, 2 months and 5 days (432 Government asking the Governor to    days)       to      send        a consider the mercy petition first.   recommendation        to      the 7.5.12   A decision to reject the mercy       Governor, or any account of petition is taken in the Cabinet     what steps were taken to Meeting and recommendation is        process the mercy petition sent to the Governor.                during this period. 2.     6.6.12   The mercy petition is rejected by    2 months and 25 days (85 days) the Governor                         delay to forward the mercy 30.8.12  The State Government forwards the    petition    to    the    Central mercy petition for consideration by  Government. the President. 3.     18.9.12  The Central Government seeks the     3 months and 9 days delay to following information from the       send information that is readily State Government –                   available with the State (i)      Copy of mercy petition Government. submitted       by the Despite        the       Central condemned prisoner     Government’s request that this himself, if any.       information be sent at the (ii)     Details of previous    earliest (21.11.2012 letter), the criminal record.

The Petitioner submits that he was kept in single cell from 2006 to 2016 in a block called the Andheri Block. During this time, he was kept for most of the day inside the cell. The only other person he saw was the prison guard. He was made to eat and use the toilet within his cell and was not allowed to meet or speak to any other inmates, to this entire duration he was allowed to participate in a pooja and a yoga camp only in one instance. Therefore from 2006-2016 the Petitioner was kept in strict solitary confinement. 32.     The Petitioner concedes that after 2016 the conditions of his incarceration were gradually relaxed and at present, even though he is kept in a single cell, he is allowed to mingle with other inmates in the yard during the day. 33.    The Petitioner submits that despite having pleaded the specific conditions of his solitary confinement till 2016 in his writ petition before the Hon’ble High Court as well as in his SLP before this Hon’ble Court the Respondent has not brought on record any material to the contrary. 34.    In its reply dated 9.1.2017 before the Hon'ble High Court (SLP Pg 316-325) and before this Hon‘ble Court the Respondent has merely stated that the Petitioner was allowed visits to the library and canteen and allowed visitors from time to time and hence his incarceration did not constitute solitary confinement. 35.    That neither before the High Court nor in its affidavit in reply before this Hon’ble Court did the Respondent aver that the Petitioner was allowed to mingle with other prisoners between 2006-2016. That had the Petitioner been allowed to mingle with other prisoners, the Respondents would have mentioned the same in their affidavit in reply along with the fact of visits to the library and canteen. Therefore, it is clear that the Respondent's oral argument made before this Hon'ble Court is nothing but an afterthought and sans any evidentiary basis. 36.    Further, the statements made by the superintendent of Belagum Central Prison before this Hon‘ble Court only pertains to the conditions of incarceration after 2019, when the Superintendent assumed his duties in Belgaum Central Prison. These statements do not attest to the conditions of incarceration prior to 2019.” 11. In the written submissions filed on behalf of Union of India, it has been asserted: - It is submitted that the Petitioner has conceded that there is no inordinate delay on part of the Respondent No.1 in deciding the mercy petition. It is a settled position of law that there can be no specific time limit prescribed for deciding mercy petitions [See, Para 41-44 of Shatrughan Chauhan and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.6] and only undue or inordinate delay is what is to be looked at [See, Para 16-17, Para 71-76 of Triveniben v. State of Gujarat7]. The time taken for collating the information and analyzing the same is not to be considered as undue. Further, it is also established that there can be no absolute or unqualified rule laid down for the purposes of determining delay in mercy petitions and several factors are required to be taken into account while considering the question as to whether the death sentence should be vacated or not [See, Para 19 of Sher Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab8]. Every case is required to be considered on its own facts and circumstances. 01.02.2011      Conviction of the Petitioner and imposition of death sentence on him is confirmed by the Hon’ble Supreme 08.02.2011     Petitioner’s mother files a mercy petition on behalf of the Petitioner. 17.02.2011     Review Petition is filed against the Hon’ble Supreme Court judgement 07.09.2011     The Review Petition is dismissed. 06.06.2012     The Mercy Petition is rejected by the 30.08.2012     Mercy petition is forwarded by the Respondent No.2 to Respondent No.1. 18.09.2012,    Respondent No.1 requests certain 27.11.2012     documents, including the medical health report of the Petitioner, to be sent by the Respondent No. 2. 26.12.2012     Respondent No. 2 replied to the letter dated    18.09.2012       providing     the 12.05.2013     The Mercy Petition was rejected by the It is submitted that the delay, if any, on part of the Respondent No. 1 has to be calculated from 26.12.2012 [when the required information was sent to the Central Govt.] till 12.05.2013 [when the mercy petition was finally rejected]. This amounts to approximately 5 months, which cannot be considered as inordinate delay. In any-event, the Petitioner has himself conceded that the delay in considering the mercy petition is not on account of the Without prejudice to the above, it is further submitted that the Petitioner did not prefer a Writ Petition till 17.10.2016 against the order of rejection of mercy petition by the Hon’ble President that was done on 12.05.2013. This step of seeking a judicial review of the rejection of the mercy petition was only taken after the Review Petition was finally rejected by the Hon’ble Supreme Court after granting a hearing in Open Court. The Convict was protected by the stay on execution granted by this Hon’ble Court in Writ Petition No. 52 of 2011 (B.A. Umesh v. Registrar, Supreme Court of India). The Petitioner couldn't be placed on the same pedestal as a convict condemned to death as he still had a judicial avenue open and no real apprehension of execution. It is submitted that the aspect of solitary confinement, if any, of the Petitioner is within the purview of the State Government/ Respondent No. 2 and therefore, no specific submissions are being made in this regard on behalf of the Respondent No.1. In any event, vide order dated 21.04.2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court had directed the District Judge, Belgaum, to conduct a local inspection of the jail, concentrating on the location of the barracks in which the cells of the Death Row Convicts are situated, and place a report before the Hon’ble Court along with pictures, if any. In terms of the same, a report was placed before the Hon’ble Court which clearly indicated that the Petitioner was not placed in solitary confinement. It is submitted that the relevant documents were duly considered by the Hon’ble President before rejecting the Mercy Petition of the Petitioner. The Mercy Petition was forwarded to Respondent No.1 on 30.08.2012 for consideration by the Hon’ble President under Article 72 of the Constitution of India along with the relevant documents. On 18.09.2012, Respondent No. 1 sought additional information/documents with regard to the Medical Health Report, details of previous criminal record and few other aspects concerning the Petitioner [Letter dated 18.09.2012 at page 17 of the Additional Documents filed by the Petitioner]. In response to the said letter, the required documents/information was sent by the Respondent No. 2 vide letter dated 26.12.2012, including medical report of the Petitioner dated 05.10.2012 [Letter dated 26.12.2012 at page 19 of the Additional Documents filed by the 12. We now consider the first submission regarding delay in execution of death sentence due to pendency of Mercy Petition(s). At this stage, we may refer to the following passage from the three Judge Bench decision of this Court in Ajay Kumar Pal v. Union of India & Anr.9 (to which one of us was a party) which noted some of the decisions rendered by this Court on the point: “7. The question whether delay in execution of death sentence can be a sufficient ground or reason for substituting such sentence by life imprisonment has engaged the attention of this Court over a period of time. Some of those salient instances are: 7.1. In T.V. Vatheeswaran v. State of Tamil Nadu10, in an appeal arising from the Judgment of the High Court confirming the death sentence, the fact that the appellant was awarded death sentence by the first court eight years earlier, was noted by this Court. After referring to few earlier cases, where such delay during the pendency of the appellate proceedings was considered, it was observed: (SCC pp. 78-79, paras 21-21) "20. . . . In the United States of America where the right to a speedy trial is a constitutionally guaranteed right, the denial of a speedy trial has been held to entitle an accused person to the dismissal of the indictment or the vacation of the sentence (vide Strunk v. United States [1973] 37 L.Ed. 56). Analogy of American Law is not permissible, but interpreting our Constitution sui generis, as we are bound to do, we find no impediment in holding that the dehumanising factor of prolonged delay in the execution of a sentence of death has the constitutional implication of depriving a person of his life in an unjust, unfair and unreasonable way as to offend the constitutional guarantee that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. The appropriate relief in such a case is to vacate the sentence of death. 21. . . . Making all reasonable allowance for the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve, we think that delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death. We therefore accept the special leave petition, allow the appeal as also the Writ Petition and quash the sentence of death. In the place of the sentence of death, we substitute the sentence of imprisonment for life." 7.2. Sher Singh and others v. State of Punjab8 was a case where the death sentence already stood confirmed by dismissal of appeal and review petition therefrom by this Court. Relying on the observations in Vatheeswaran10, delay in execution was projected as a ground in a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. Though the Court was broadly in agreement with observations in Vatheeswaran10 it did not agree with the statement to the effect: (SCC p. 79, para 21) "21. . . . that delay exceeding two years in the execution of sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence to death to invoke Article 21 and demand the questioning of the sentence of death." However, in the context of Mercy Petitions and exercise of power in connection thereto, it was observed in para 23 as under: (Sher Singh Case8, SCC "23. We must take this opportunity to impress upon the Government of India and the State Governments that petitions filed under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution or under Sections 432 and 433 of the Criminal Procedure Code must be disposed of expeditiously. A self- imposed rule should be followed by the executive authorities rigorously, that every such petition shall be disposed of within a period of three months from the date on which it is received. Long and interminable delays in the disposal of these petitions are a serious hurdle in the dispensation of justice and indeed, such delays tend to shake the confidence of the people in the very system of justice. Several instances can be cited, to which the record of this Court will bear testimony, in which petitions are pending before the State Governments and the Government of India for an inexplicably long period. Undoubtedly, the executive has the power, in appropriate cases, to act under the aforesaid provisions but, if we may remind, all exercise of power is preconditioned by the duty to be fair and quick. Delay defeats justice." 7.3. The issue was settled by the Constitution Bench decision in Triveniben v. State of Gujarat7, where it was concluded "No fixed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable ...". The scope and ambit of exercise of jurisdiction in such cases was delineated thus in para 22: (SCC p. 697) "22. . . . the only jurisdiction which could be sought to be exercised by a prisoner for infringement of his rights can be to challenge the subsequent events after the final judicial verdict is pronounced and it is because of this that on the ground of long or inordinate delay a condemned prisoner could approach this Court and that is what has consistently been held by this Court. But it will not be open to this Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 32 to go behind or to examine the final verdict reached by a competent court convicting and sentencing the condemned prisoner and even while considering the circumstances in order to reach a conclusion as to whether the inordinate delay coupled with subsequent circumstances could be held to be sufficient for coming to a conclusion that execution of the sentence of death will not be just and proper. The nature of the offence, circumstances in which the offence was committed will have to be taken as found by the competent court while finally passing the verdict. It may also be open to the court to examine or consider any circumstances after the final verdict was pronounced if it is considered relevant. The question of improvement in the conduct of the prisoner after the final verdict also cannot be considered for coming to the conclusion whether the sentence could be altered on that ground also." 7.4. In Shatrughan Chauhan6 after considering law on the point as regards delay in execution of the death sentence and the resultant effect, as also the scope and ambit of exercise of power, it was observed in paras 38, 41 and 42 as under: (SCC pp. 38-39) "44. In view of the above, we hold that undue long delay in execution of sentence of death will entitle the condemned prisoner to approach this Court under Article 32. However, this Court will only examine the circumstances surrounding the delay that has occurred and those that have ensued after sentence was finally confirmed by the judicial process. This Court cannot reopen the conclusion already reached but may consider the question of inordinate delay to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. 47. It is clear that after the completion of the judicial process, if the convict files a mercy petition to the Governor/President, it is incumbent on the authorities to dispose of the same expeditiously. Though no time limit can be fixed for the Governor and the President, it is the duty of the executive to expedite the matter at every stage, viz., calling for the records, orders and documents filed in the court, preparation of the note for approval of the Minister concerned, and the ultimate decision of the constitutional authorities. This court, in Triveniben7, further held that in doing so, if it is established that there was prolonged delay in the execution of death sentence, it is an important and relevant consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be executed or not. 48. Accordingly, if there is undue, unexplained and inordinate delay in execution due to pendency of mercy petitions or the executive as well as the constitutional authorities have failed to take note of/consider the relevant aspects, this Court is well within its powers under Article 32 to hear the grievance of the convict and commute the death sentence into life imprisonment on this ground alone however, only after satisfying that the delay was not caused at the instance of the accused himself. To this extent, the jurisprudence has developed in the light of the mandate given in our Constitution as well as various Universal Declarations and directions issued by the United Nations." 13. In Ajay Kumar Pal9 the delay in question was three years and ten months which was found to be inordinate and that said delay was not to the account of said petitioner but to the account of the functionaries and authorities in question. Pertinently, the matter was also considered from the standpoint of solitary confinement and violations in that behalf. 14. Paras 44 and 48 of the decision of this Court in Shatrughan Chauhan6 which were quoted in Ajay Kumar Pal9, had laid down that undue long delay in execution of death sentence would entitle the condemned prisoner to pray for commuting the death sentence to that of life imprisonment. The individual cases were thereafter dealt with in Shatrughan Chauhan6 and paragraph 105 onwards of said decision show that in cases where there was a delay of 12 years (para 118), 9 ½ years (Para 137), 9 ½ years (Para 147), 7 years and 8 months (Para 161), 5 years and 8 months (Para 175) and 7 years and 5 months (Para 209), the benefit of commutation was extended by this Court. 15. If the instant matter is considered in light of these cases and the settled principles, the alleged period in the instant matter is of two years and three months i.e., starting from the receipt of the mercy petition on 3.3.2011 by the Central Government till the disposal on 15.5.2013. It must be stated that soon after the receipt of the said mercy petition, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India forwarded the mercy petition to the Principal Secretary, Home Department, Karnataka so that the Governor, Karnataka could consider the mercy petition first.            In the meantime, on 9.3.2011 in Writ Petition No.52 of 2011 preferred by the appellant, this Court had granted stay of execution of death The matter was considered by the State Cabinet on 7.5.2012 which decided to approve the note prepared by the Home Department recommending rejection of the mercy petition. The matter was then placed before the Hon’ble Governor who rejected the mercy petition on 06.06.2012. The copy of the order passed by the Hon’ble Governor and relevant documents were forwarded by the State Government to the Central Government on On 18.09.2012, certain information was sought by the Central Government from the State Government which was furnished to the Central Government on 26.12.2012. The matter was thereafter taken up at the Central Government level.        The Ministry of Home Affairs prepared an appropriate note for the Hon’ble President who after considering the entirety of the matter rejected the mercy petition on 12.05.2013. 16. Thus, the entire period beginning from 03.03.2011 to 15.05.2013 spanning over a period of 2 years and 3 months saw disposal of mercy petition at two different levels, one, by the Hon’ble Governor and other by the Hon’ble President.        All the while, there was an order of stay granted by this Court on 19.3.2011 which was operating all through. 17. First and foremost, the time taken by each of these authorities and the functionaries assisting them cannot be called or termed as “inordinate delay” and secondly, it was not as if every passing day was adding to the agony of appellant. The order of stay of execution had put the matter in a different perspective. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, in our view, the first submission does not merit acceptance.     We are conscious of the fact that in a recent decision in A.G. Perarivalan vs. State through Superintendent of Police & Anr.11, a Bench of three judges of this court commuted the sentence of death to life as the petition preferred under Article 161 of the Constitution had remained pending for two and half years with the Hon’ble Governor, despite the recommendations of the State Cabinet for remission of the sentence. In that case no decision was taken by the Hon’ble Governor in spite of the recommendations of the State Cabinet and as such the benefit of commutation was extended. The facts which came up for consideration in said decision thus stand on a completely different footing as against the instant 18. We now move to the second submission pertaining to solitary confinement of the appellant. Reliance in this behalf has been placed on the decision of this Court in Sunil Batra vs. Delhi Administration & Ors.5; and also on the decision of Ajay Kumar Pal9 in which segregation of the concerned petitioner, from the day he was awarded death sentence till his mercy petition was disposed of, was taken to be in violation of the law laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra5 and the death sentence was commuted to life on both counts, namely; inordinate delay in considering the mercy petition and the solitary confinement that the concerned petitioner was subjected to. 19. In the instant case, the letter written by Medical Officer, Belgaum Central Prison on 6.11.2011 did say that the appellant was kept in solitary confinement and said letter has been heavily relied upon by the appellant in support of the second submission. According to the letter, the appellant was kept in solitary confinement since his admission to the prison in October, 2006 and that apart from common illness such as diarrhoea, fever, running nose and backache, the appellant was found to be suffering from psychosis with depression.          Pertinently, on 8.11.2011, a letter was sent by the Chief Superintendent, Belagavi Central Prison to Additional DGP and IG Prisons, Karnataka to the following effect: - “….. With respect to the above subject, we submit, that the death penalty convict no. 307, Umesh B.R. son of Ajjappa Reddy’s appeal petition was rejected by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, New Delhi and a letter confirming his death sentence has been sent to this office as mentioned in the reference. The said subject matter and processes have been explained in detail several times to the convict in the presence of all officers, but as the convict is mentally ill he is not agreeing to submit any more mercy petitions. So we have not received any mercy petitions from him. The convict was examined by the Prison Doctors and have given a medical report which is attached with this letter for your perusal and for further This letter also affirms the fact that the appellant was mentally ill. 20. The act on part of the medical officer in checking the health and well-being of the appellant was obviously because of the mandate of Section 29 of the Prisons Act, 1894 which is to the following effect: - “29.       Solitary confinement. – No cell shall be used for solitary confinement unless it is furnished with the means of enabling the prisoner to communicate at any time with an officer of the prison, and every prisoner so confined in a cell for more than twenty-four hours, whether as a punishment or otherwise, shall be visited at least once a day by the Medical Officer or Medical Subordinate.” It must, therefore, be taken to be accepted that from 2006 till 2016, the appellant was kept in solitary confinement in “Andheri Block” and it was only thereafter, some relaxation in the rigours of the solitary confinement was effected and as the record shows, from 2016 onwards the conditions were gradually relaxed. 21. The law on the point, as declared in Sunil Batra5 is very clear and as was held by this Court in Ajay Kumar Pal9, segregation of a convict from the day when he was awarded death sentence till his mercy petition was disposed of, would be in violation of law laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra5. In the instant case, the death sentence was awarded to the appellant in 2006 by the trial Court and the mercy petition was finally disposed of by the Hon’ble President on 12.5.2013, which means that the incarceration of the appellant in solitary confinement and segregation from 2006 to 2013 was without the sanction of law and completely opposed to the principles laid down by this Court 22. In Ajay Kumar Pal9, on the issue of segregation of the convict in violation of the principles laid down in Sunil Batra5, this Court observed: - “9. Furthermore, as submitted in the petition, the petitioner has all the while been in solitary confinement i.e. since the day he was awarded death sentence. While dealing with Section 30(2) of the Prisons Act, 1894, which postulates segregation of a person “under sentence of death” Krishna Iyer, J. in Sunil Batra5 observed: (SCC p. 563, para 197-A) “197-A. (5) The crucial holding under Section 30(2) is that a person is not ‘under sentence of death’, even if the sessions court has sentenced him to death subject to confirmation by the High Court. He is not ‘under sentence of death’ even if the High Court imposes, by confirmation or fresh appellate infliction, death penalty, so long as an appeal to the Supreme Court is likely to be or has been moved or is pending. Even if this Court has awarded capital sentence, Section 30 does not cover him so long as his petition for mercy to the Governor and/or to the President permitted by the Constitution, Code and Prison Rules, has not been disposed. Of course, once rejected by the Governor and the President, and on further application there is no stay of execution by the authorities, he is ‘under sentence of death’, even if he goes on making further mercy petitions. During that interregnum he attracts the custodial segregation specified in Section 30(2), subject to the ameliorative meaning assigned to the provision. To be ‘under sentence of death’ means ‘to be under a finally executable death sentence’.” (emphasis in original) Speaking for the majority in the concurring judgment D.A. Desai, J. stated thus : (Sunil Batra case5, SCC p. 572, para “223. The expression ‘prisoner under sentence of death’ in the context of sub-section (2) of Section 30 can only mean the prisoner whose sentence of death has become final, conclusive and indefeasible which cannot be annulled or voided by any judicial or constitutional procedure. In other words, it must be a sentence which the authority charged with the duty to execute and carry out must proceed to carry out without intervention from any outside authority.” 10. In the light of the enunciation of law by this Court, the petitioner could never have been “segregated” till his mercy petition was disposed of. It is only after such disposal that he could be said to be under a finally executable death sentence. The law laid down by this Court was not adhered to at all while confining the petitioner in solitary confinement right since the order of death sentence by the first court. In our view, this is complete transgression of the right under Article 21 of the Constitution causing incalculable harm to the petitioner. 11. The combined effect of the inordinate delay in disposal of mercy petition and the solitary confinement for such a long period, in our considered view has caused deprivation of the most cherished right. A case is definitely made out under Article 32 of the Constitution of India and this Court deems it proper to reach out and grant solace to the petitioner for the ends of justice. We, therefore, commute the sentence and substitute the sentence of life imprisonment in place of death sentence awarded to the petitioner. The writ petition thus stands allowed.” 23. In its jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, this Court had thus deemed it proper to reach out and grant solace to the petitioner on both grounds, namely, delay in disposal of mercy petition and solitary confinement for a long period. The period of solitary confinement in Ajay Kumar Pal9 in violation of the law laid down in Sunil Batra5 was from 2007 till 2014, i.e., for nearly seven years.        In the instant case, the period of solitary confinement is for about ten years and has two elements: one, from 2006 till the disposal of mercy petition in 2013; and secondly from the date of such disposal till 2016.            The question then arises: whether on this ground alone, the appellant is entitled to have the death sentence commuted? 24. In     Shatrughan        Chauhan6,        solitary    confinement    was accepted and recognised as one of the grounds on the basis of which death sentence can be commuted. However, in the batch of matters under consideration in Shatrughan Chauhan6, no benefit was granted to any of the convicts on this ground. Paragraph 88 onwards, the effect of the law laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra5 and other cases was noticed and it was concluded “90. It was, therefore, held in Sunil Batra case5, that the solitary confinement, even if mollified and modified marginally, is not sanctioned by Section 30 of the Prisons Act for prisoners “under sentence of death”. The crucial holding under Section 30(2) is that a person is not “under sentence of death”, even if the Sessions Court has sentenced him to death subject to confirmation by the High Court. He is not “under sentence of death” even if the High Court imposes, by confirmation or fresh appellate infliction, death penalty, so long as an appeal to the Supreme Court is likely to be or has been moved or is pending. Even if this Court has awarded capital sentence, it was held that Section 30 does not cover him so long as his petition for mercy to the Governor and/or to the President permitted by the Constitution, has not been disposed of. Of course, once rejected by the Governor and the President, and on further application, there is no stay of execution by the authorities, the person is under sentence of death. During that interregnum, he attracts the custodial segregation specified in Section 30(2), subject to the ameliorative meaning assigned to the provision. To be “under sentence of death” means “to be under a finally executable death sentence”. 91. Even in Triveniben v. State of Gujarat7, this Court observed that keeping a prisoner in solitary confinement is contrary to the ruling in Sunil Batra5 and would amount to inflicting “additional and separate” punishment not authorised by law. It is completely unfortunate that despite enduring pronouncement on judicial side, the actual implementation of the provisions is far from reality. We take this occasion to urge to the Jail Authorities to comprehend and implement the actual intent of the verdict in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn.5.” 25. The benefit of commutation was, however, granted in Ajay Kumar Pal9 on the ground that the solitary confinement was against the principles laid down in Sunil Batra5 and also on the ground of delay. Having considered the entirety of matter, in our view, the impact of solitary confinement were obviously evident in the instant case, as would be clear from the letter given by the medical professional on 6.11.2011 and the communication emanating from the jail on 8.11.2011. The incarceration in solitary confinement thus did show ill effects on the well-being of the appellant. In the backdrop of these features of the matter, in our view, the appellant is entitled to have the death sentence imposed upon him to be commuted to death sentence to life. 26. At this stage, we may refer to a recent decision by a three- Judge Bench in Mohd. Mannan alias Abdul Mannan vs. State of Bihar12, where while accepting the review petition, the sentence of death was commuted to imprisonment for life. However, it was observed in paragraphs 87 and 88 as under: - “87. Even though life imprisonment means imprisonment for entire life, convicts are often granted reprieve and/or remission of sentence after imprisonment of not less than 14 years. In this case, considering the heinous, revolting, abhorrent and despicable nature of the crime committed by the petitioner, we feel that the petitioner should undergo imprisonment for life, till his natural death and no remission of sentence be granted to him. 88. We, therefore, commute the death sentence imposed on the petitioner to life imprisonment, till his natural death, without reprieve or remission.” 27. Considering the entirety of facts and circumstances on record, in our view, ends of justice would be met if while commuting the death sentence awarded to the appellant, we impose upon him sentence of life imprisonment with a rider that he shall undergo minimum sentence of 30 years and if any application for remission is moved on his behalf, the same shall be considered on its own merits only after he has undergone actual sentence of 30 years. If no remission is granted, it goes without saying that as laid down by this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse vs. State of Maharashtra13, the sentence of imprisonment for life shall mean till the remainder of his life. 28. The appeal is allowed accordingly. 29. Before we part, we must observe that the instruction quoted in paragraph 3(f) of this Judgment leads to an incongruous situation. According to it, the mercy petition must be filed within seven days of the disposal of the appeal or dismissal of special leave petition.    A convicted accused is entitled to file a review petition within thirty days.    An anomalous situation, like the present one, may arise where even before the review is filed, the mercy petition is required to be filed. The concerned instruction requires suitable modification so as to enable the convicted accused to file mercy petition after exhaustion of remedies in Court of law. Date : 04-11-2022 This appeal was called on for pronouncement of Judgment today. UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India pronounced the Reportable Judgment       of  the  Bench  comprising  Hon’ble the  Chief   Justice of India, Hon’ble Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat and Hon’ble Mr. Justice The operative portion of the judgment reads as under: “1.     Leave granted. 27. Considering the entirety of facts and circumstances on record, in our view, ends of justice would be met if while commuting the death sentence awarded to the appellant, we impose upon him sentence of life imprisonment with a rider that he shall undergo minimum sentence of 30 years and if any application for remission is moved on his behalf, the same shall be considered on its own merits only after he has undergone actual sentence of 30 years. If no remission is granted, it goes without saying that as laid down by this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse vs. State of Maharashtra1, the sentence of imprisonment for life shall mean till the remainder of his life. 28. The appeal is allowed accordingly. 29. Before we part, we must observe that the instruction quoted in paragraph 3(f) of this Judgment leads to an incongruous situation.

(Signed Reportable Judgment is placed on the File)
Heard the learned counsel Sri.Ranganatha S. Jois for the petitioners, learned Additional Government Advocate Sri.M.V.Ramesh Jois for respondent No.1 and learned counsel Sri.H.L.Pradeep Kumar for respondent No.2. Perused the writ petition papers. 2.     Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit    that   the    petitioners retired from   second respondent – the Karnataka Housing Board (for short KHB) on attaining the age of superannuation on 30.06.2018 and 31.08.2020 respectively. Subsequent to their retirement, Annexure-C, Charge Memo dated 21.06.2022 is issued to the petitioners initiating enquiry in respect of an event taken place in the year 2005-06. Learned counsel would submit that in terms of Rule 214 (2) (b)(ii) of the Karnataka Civil Services Rules [for short KCSRs], Charge memo would not be maintainable and no enquiry could be initiated against a retired person in respect of an event which had taken place more than four years prior to institution of enquiry against retired Government Servant. Thus, he submits that only on the ground that initiation of enquiry under Annexure-C, Charge Memo dated 21.06.2022 is barred under Rule 214 (2) (b)(ii) of the KCSRs, it is liable to be set aside. 3.      Learned counsel Sri.H.L.Pradeep Kumar on instructions would submit that initially enquiry was initiated against the petitioners while they were in service      on     28.09.2013    and     thereafter    under Annexure-B, order dated 21.08.2014, petitioners were exonerated       of  the  Charges.    Subsequently    on    the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee, the present proceedings is initiated. Thus, he submits that there is continuation of cause of action. Hence, he justifies     the     Charge        Memo      issued      against   the 4.      It is not in dispute that petitioners retired on 30.06.2018 and 31.08.2020 respectively on attaining the    age      of    superannuation.            Charge     Memo     at Annexure-C dated 21.06.2022 was issued subsequent to retirement of petitioners. The first charge against the petitioners reads as follows: ¨É¼ÀUÁA f¯ÉèAiÀÄ PÀAPÀ£ÀªÁr UÁæªÀÄzÀ gÁªÀÄzÀÄUÀð 8J          gÀ°è        15-19        JPÀgÉ        d«ÄÃ£À£ÀÄß ¨sÀÆ¸Áé¢üÃ£À¥Àr¹PÉÆ¼Àî®Ä ²¥sÁgÀ¸ÀÄì ªÀiÁr, vÀzÀ£ÀAvÀgÀ G¥À«¨sÁUÁ¢üPÁj,           ¨ÉÊ®ºÉÆAUÀ®     gÀªÀgÀÄ   ¢£ÁAPÀ 26.08.2006     gÀAzÀÄ   ¸ÀzÀj   d«ÄÃ£ÀÄUÀ¼À°è  læAiÀÄ¯ï ¦mïUÀ¼À£ÀÄß ºÁQzÀÄÝ, CzÀgÀ°è 8 jAzÀ 10 Cr vÀUÀÄÎ vÉÆÃqÀ¯ÁVzÀÝgÀÆ ¸ÀºÀ UÀnÖ ¥ÁAiÀÄ EgÀÄªÀÅ¢®è JA§ÄzÁV w½¹zÀÝgÀÆ      ¸ÀzÀj    d«ÄÃ¤£À°è     ªÀ¸Àw   AiÉÆÃd£É ¸ÀzÀj PÁªÀÄUÁjUÁV gÀÆ.1.99 PÉÆÃn ªÉZÀÑ ¨sÀj¹ GzÁ¹Ã£ÀvÉ ºÁUÀÆ PÀvÀðªÀå ¯ÉÆÃ¥ÀªÀ£ÀÄß vÉÆÃj¸ÀÄvÀÛzÉ.” A reading of the above Charge would clearly indicates that the Charge is against an incident which had taken place in the year 2006. 6.     Rule 214 (2)(b)(ii) of the KCSRs reads thus: “214       (2)   (b)    The     departmental proceedings,       if  not   instituted    while   the Government servant was in service, whether before     his   retirement    or   during    his   re- employment. (ii) shall not be in respect of any event which took place more than four years before such institution.” The  above    Rule which is applicable     to the employees of KHB would not permit initiation of enquiry in respect of an event which took place more than 4 years before such institution in respect of a retired 7.   In the case on hand, initiation of enquiry and issuance     of Charge     Memo dated 21.06.2022 (Annexure-C) is in respect of an event which took place more than 4 years before such institution against retired petitioners. Thus, the institution of enquiry under Charge Memo is barred by Rule 214 (2)(b)(ii) of KCSRs. Thus, the Charge Memo is not sustainable in law. Hence, the following: b)   Annexure-C,     Charge    Memo  bearing dated 21.06.2022 as well as Annexure-D, appointment of Enquiry Officer bearing dated 20.08.2022 are quashed. c) The respondent No.2 is directed to settle the terminal benefits of the petitioners if there is no other enquiry or impediment to release within three months, if not already settled.
1.   The issue raised in this appeal is that whether interim   victim    compensation   in   proceedings   for anticipatory bail can be imposed as a condition for the same. 2.   We do believe that the impugned order suffers from an infraction of law as the question of interim victim  compensation    cannot  form  part  of  the  bail jurisprudence. 3.   This   issue   already   stands  clarified   by  the pronouncements of this Court       inter alia in    Sahab alam  @  Guddu   v.   The  State  of  Jharkhand   &  Anr. -Criminal Appeal No.1318/2022, dated 24.08.2022 and ASHA SUNDRIYAL         Udho Thakur and Anr. ETC. v. The State of Jharkhand & Anr. - Criminal Appeal Nos.1703-1704 of 2022 dated 4.   In Sahab Alam case (supra) we had dealt with the orders passed by the learned Judge in various matters  granting   bail   on   condition   of   depositing substantive sums of money without consideration of the requirements of bail dependent on the nature of offences and thus, it was observed that bail cannot per se be granted if a person can afford to deposit the money or has the capacity to pay. 5.   All the impugned orders were set aside and the matter was remitted back. 6.   In Udho Thakur (supra) the aspect of use of expression   “victim   compensation”    was   found  to  be inappropriate as pre-arrest bail proceedings are not money recovery proceedings. 7.   The matter in this case is one step further as it is not a payment of money/deposit of money as a condition   of  grant   of  anticipatory    bail   but  the direction is to pay interim victim compensation in the proceedings for anticipatory bail. 8.   Looking    back    on    the    aspect     of   victim compensation    we   may   note    that   in    1960s   the ‘victimology’    movement     made   way    for    monetary compensations offered an incentive to governments by linking such compensation to victims’ cooperation in the pursuit of criminal prosecutions.           Canada and several   states   within    the   United    States   began providing victim compensation and thereby encouraged participation in criminal prosecutions.          The early 80s witnessed the pioneers of victimology and victim justice taking predominant initiatives of reforming the criminal justice system on behalf of the victims of crime.   The UN Declaration on Basic Principles of Justice   for    Victims   and    Abuse   of    Power   was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly in 1985 (Groenhuijsen, 2014).     The Declaration made way for specific   rights   and  entitlements    of    victims   of crime, including the right to compensation. 9.   Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for order to pay compensation when a court imposes a sentence of fine or a sentence (including a sentence of death) of which fine forms a part in the circumstances enumerated therein.          Sub-section (2) imposes a limitation that when fine is imposed in a case which is subject to appeal no such payment shall   be   made   before   the    period   allowed    for presenting the appeal has elapsed, or if an appeal is presented, before the decision of the appeal. Under sub-section (3) it is by way of compensation for the person who has suffered any loss or injury by reason of the act for which the accused person has   been   so   sentenced.      Sub-section    (4)   also provides for the appellate court or the High Court or   Court    of   Sessions    to   direct    payment    of compensation when exercising its power of revisions. 10. We   have   set  forth   this  to   appreciate  that victim compensation is simultaneous with the final view taken in respect of the alleged offence, i.e., whether it was so committed or not and, thus, there is no question of any imposition pre-finality of the matter pre-trial. 11. In a recent judgment of this Court in Dharmesh v. State of Gujarat1 it was opined that it was clear from the plain reading of Section 357 that such compensation can only arise after the conclusion of trial albeit, of course, the same being a matter of discretion.    The  High   Court’s   direction   to  the accused for deposit of compensation for the legal heirs of the deceased (victim), as a condition for the bail cannot be sustained and, thus, logically set aside. 12.   The Court opined that the objective is clear that in cases of offences against body, compensation to the victim should be methodology for redemption. Similarly,     to   prevent    unnecessary    harassment, compensation    has  been   provided   where  meaningless criminal   proceedings    had  been   started.    Such  a compensation can hardly be determined at the stage of grant of bail. 13.   Not   being    appreciative    of   such   judicial misadventure, we have no hesitation in quashing the condition   imposed  in the  impugned   order  in  this behalf while maintaining the other aspects of the grant of anticipatory bail. 14.  The   appeal   is  accordingly   allowed   leaving parties to bear their own costs.
1.            By this appeal, the appellant challenges judgment and order dated 20.7.2017 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chandrapur in Sessions Case No.111/2015 whereby he is convicted for offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay fine Rs.50,000/- and in default of payment of the fine amount to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months. The appellant is also given set-off under Section 428 of the Indian Penal Code since he is in jail. 2.           Heard learned counsel Shri S.G.Joshi appointed for the appellant and learned Additional Public Prosecutor Shri M.J.Khan for 3.           The case of the prosecution in a nutshell is as under: The crime is registered on the basis of report lodged by one Sunil Shendre on 4.9.2015 on allegations that deceased Chhaya was residing along with her husband i.e. the appellant (for short, “the accused”) and daughter Kajal in his neighbourhood. He is residing along with his family at Nanded, taluka Nagbhid, district Chandrapur. The accused is in a habit of drinking liquor and used to beat his wife on trifle reasons.   On 3.9.2015, when the informant was sleeping in his house, he heard the accused abusing his wife and, therefore, he came out of his house. It is alleged that he saw that the accused was quarreling with his wife started assaulting her by kick and fist blows on the count that she had not cooked meat properly and she burnt it.      It is further alleged that when the informant went there, the accused threatened him that if he intervenes in the quarrel, he will kill him.  Due to the threat, the informant left along with accused’s daughter Kajal. At about 11:30 p.m., he saw that the wife of the accused is lying dead in the shed and, therefore, he approached police and lodged the report. 4.           On the basis of the report lodged by the informant, Nagbhid Police Station, District Chandrapur registered the offence vide Crime No.101/2015 under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.    After registration of the crime, wheels of investigation started rotating. During investigation, Investigating Officer visited the alleged spot of the incident and seized incriminating articles, pieces of bangles, and a stick by drawing spot panchnama.           The Investigating Officer also drawn inquest panchnama, seized clothes of deceased, clothes of accused, and samples of deceased and accused, collected postmortem notes and after completion of the investigation, submitted chargesheet against the accused in the Court of law. 5.           Learned Magistrate committed the case to the Court of Sessions. The charge was framed against the accused vide Exhibit- 3. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 6.           To substantiate the charge levelled against the accused, the prosecution examined as many as 11 witnesses, as mentioned 15), pancha on spot; pancha on clothes’ seizure panchanama ; (4) Kajal Suresh Shendre (PW4) (Exhibit-37), the daughter of the accused and the deceased; Assistant Police Inspector, and 7.          Besides the evidence, the prosecution relied upon various documents including spot panchnama Exhibit-19, inquest panchnama Exhibit-21, clothes’ seizure panchnamas Exhibits-24 and 25, seizure memo Exhibit-26, oral report Exhibit-28, printed First  Information   Report  Exhibit-29,    and  Chemical    Analyzer’s 8.           The defence of the accused is of total denial.     As per defence of the accused, the deceased was suffering from “Epilepsy” and on the day of incident she had stroke of Epilepsy and fallen on the ground and sustained injuries. 9.           Learned   counsel   Shri   S.G.Joshi  for  the   appellant submitted that     to prove the homicidal death the prosecution Shivankar. Though the Medical Officer has denied the possibility of sustaining injuries due to the fall due to stroke by Epilepsy, the oral evidence shows that the deceased was suffering from Epilepsy and and on the day of the incident also due to Stroke of Epilepsy she fallen on the ground and sustained injuries. He further submitted that the oral evidence of witnesses PW3 informant Sunil Suresh Shendre and PW4 accused’s and deceased’s daughter Kajal Suresh Shendre who acquainted with the deceased specifically stated that the deceased had sustained injuries due to the fall.         Thus, the prosecution has not proved the homicidal death of the deceased. He further submitted that the prosecution relied on the evidence of PW3    informant    Sunil  Suresh    Shendre;   PW4    accused’s    and deceased’s    daughter    Kajal   Suresh   Shendre;   PW5   accused’s neighbour Tarabai Suresh Shendre, and PW6 accused’s neighbour Indubai Suresh Raut who had not supported the prosecution case. Thus, the prosecution failed to prove the charges levelled against the  accused.      Alternatively,  he  submitted   that  even   if  the prosecution case is taken as it is, there was no intention on the part of the accused to commit the murder of the deceased, whatever happened is in a spur of moment as the accused lost his self control as the deceased had not cooked the food properly. The accused has not acted brutally. The injuries sustained by the deceased were not on the vital parts. The exception 4 under Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code is available to the accused.      In a sudden fight and a sudden quarrel, the accused had given the blow by stick and the deceased succumbed to death.          He further submitted that the prosecution relied on the evidence of PW3 informant Sunil Suresh Shendre; PW4 accused’s and deceased’s daughter Kajal Suresh Shendre; PW5 accused’s neighbour Tarabai Suresh Shendre, and PW6 accused’s neighbour Indubai Suresh Raut who had not supported the prosecution case.       Thus, the prosecution failed to prove the charges levelled against the accused. He submitted that the accused be acquitted from the charge and alternatively he prayed for the lesser punishment in view of the exception sudden fight and sudden quarrel. 10.          On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor Shri M.J.Khan for the State submitted that the deceased is the wife of the accused.      The accused had committed her murder by assaulting her repeatedly and due to the repeated blows the deceased had sustained in all six injuries as well as internal injuries which resulted into her death. There was instantaneous death of the deceased. Though PW3, PW4, PW5, and PW6 had not supported the prosecution case, circumstantial evidence on record is sufficient to show that the accused is the perpetrator of the crime. The defence of a sudden fight and a sudden quarrel is not available to the accused as the quarrel was only from one side.             Hence, no interference is called for in the judgment and order impugned in the 11.          As regards the homicidal death of the deceased namely Chhaya is concerned, the material evidence adduced by the prosecution is the testimony of PW7 Medical Officer Dr.Sanjaykumar Diwakarrao Shivankar who conducted the postmortem examination on Chhaya and PW1 Vilas Bhajandas Mungmode who acted as pancha on the inquest panchnama.        The testimony of PW1 Vilas shows that he was called by the police in the hospital and in his presence the panchnama regarding the dead body was conducted. He witnessed that there was injury on the lower lip as well as on the lower abdomen portion over the left thigh.         Accordingly, inquest panchanama (Exhibit-21) was drawn. Though PW1 Vilas was cross- examined at length, nothing incriminating is brought on record to deny the injuries on the person of the deceased. 12.          The prosecution has placed implicit reliance on the evidence   of   PW7   Medical    Officer  Dr.Sanjaykumar    Diwakarrao Shivankar, who has deposed that he performed postmortem on the dead body on 4.9.2015 and noted the external injuries on the said dead body in column No.17 of the postmortem report, which are “(1) swelling of face; (2) contusion over right infra orbital region 4x3x2 (3) contusion over right maxila of size 3x2x1 cm; (4) contusion over left maxila of size 3x3x2 cm; (5) abrasion over left forehead size 3x3 cm; (6) tenderness over left side of chest; and (7) swelling over left side of chest.” The Medical Officer has also noted internal injuries like fracture over the fourth rib on left side, contusion over the middle part of left lung, contusion over the left side of heart anteriorly of size 3x2 cm. There was rupture of pancreas, bleeding was present and rupture over the splin area of size 3x2 cms.          As per the evidence of the Medical Officer, all injures were antemortem and those were possible due to forceful assault by means of hard object like wooden rod, steel rod, kick and fist blows etc.. The cause of death was due to “Cardiogenic Shock” due to injury to vital organ. He further deposed that he also collected the blood samples of the deceased and forwarded it to the police. When the deceased was brought to him, her apparels were stained with blood. Accordingly, he prepared the postmortem notes Exhibit-56.       He also replied to the query report to the police and opined that the wooden rod referred to him was of height 2 feet 3 inches with circumference of 6.5 inches and injuries are possible by the said weapon. 13.           The Medical Officer was cross-examined at length by the defence and tried to suggest that the injuries sustained by the deceased are possible due to the fall on the hard surface which was denied by the said Medical Officer.      He further denied that the deceased had sustained injuries due fall on the ground due to stroke of Epilepsy.   Thus, the defence of the accused is that the deceased had sustained injuries due to fall on the ground as she had a stroke of Epilepsy.       Though the accused had taken the defence   that  the   deceased    was  suffering  from  Epilepsy,    no document regarding her treatment is filed on record to support the 14.          After appreciating the evidence of PW7 Medical Officer Dr.Sanjaykumar Diwakarrao Shivankar and inquest report, it reveals that the deceased had sustained injuries due to assault on her due to stick. The Medical Officer had denied the possibility that the said injuries are possible due to fall. Besides the medical opinion by the Medical Officer as regards the deceased, the Medical Officer had opportunity to see injuries while conducting the postmortem over Chhaya, the deceased. 15.          A  medical    witness,   who   performs  a   postmortem examination, is a witness of fact though he also gives an opinion on certain aspects of the case. This proposition of law has been stated by the Honourable Apex Court in the case of Smt. Nagindra Bala Mitraand vs. Sunil Chandra Roy and another, reported at 1960 SCR (3) 1 wherein the Honourable Apex Court observed that “the value of a medical witness is not merely a check upon the testimony of eyewitnesses; it is also independent testimony, because it may establish certain facts, quite apart from the other oral evidence. If a person is shot, at close range, the marks of tatooing found by the medical witness would show that the range was small, quite apart from any other opinion of his. Similarly, fractures of bones, depth and size of the wounds would show the nature of the weapon used. It is wrong to say that it is only opinion evidence; it is often direct evidence of the facts found upon the victim's person .”      Thus, the testimony of medical witness is very important and it can be safely accepted.       The    evidence   adduced   by   the  Medical    Officer corroborated by the inquest panchanama shows that the deceased died homicidal death. 16.           Sydeny Brandon in his book ‘Violence in Family’ wrote, "Statistically it is safer to be on streets after dark with a stranger than at home in the bosom of one's family, for it is there that accident, murder and violence are likely to occur". 17.           The present case is one more example of such type of violence in the house. The deceased is the wife of the accused. It is alleged that the incident had occurred as the deceased had not prepared meat properly due to which the accused got annoyed and he gave blow of sticks on her person and she succumbed to death. 18.            The prosecution placed implicit reliance on the evidence of PW3 informant Sunil Suresh Shendre who is neighbour as well as relative of the accused. PW3 Sunil had lodged the First Information Report of the incident. The prosecution also relied upon evidence of accused’s and deceased’s daughter PW4 Kajal Suresh Shendre. Both these witnesses have not supported the prosecution case. PW4 Kajal has totally left the loyalty towards the prosecution. PW3 informant Suresh Shendre had supported the prosecution case to some extent. He deposed that on the day of the incident, when he was at home, he heard the quarrel between the accused and his wife as the deceased cooked the meat of pig and burnt it.          The daughter of the accused came to his house and informed him about the quarrel and, therefore, he went to the house of the accused. He brought Kajal to his house.    He also lodged the report about the said incident which is at Exhibit-28 and printed First Information Report is at Exhibit-29.     During his cross-examination by the defence, he admitted that there used to be verbal spats between the accused and his wife, otherwise they were behaving nicely with each other. He also admitted that the deceased was suffering from Epilepsy and she used to fall on the ground due to stroke of Epilepsy. He also admitted that on the day of the incident also she suffered injuries due to stroke of Epilepsy. Thus, the defence has tried to prove the defence that the deceased had sustained injuries due to fall. 19.          As observed earlier, accused’s and deceased’s daughter PW4 Kajal has completely left the loyalty towards the prosecution. The    evidence    of   accused’s   neighbour    PW5   Tarabai   Suresh Shendrealso also shows that she left the loyalty towards the prosecution   and     initially not  supported    the  version   of   the prosecution, but during cross-examination by learned APP before the Trial Court she admitted that Kajal informed her that there was quarrel between the accused and the deceased. The accused who is her father had beaten her mother and, therefore, she died. Again during the cross-examination by the defence, this witness admitted that no such disclosure was made to her by Kajal. 20.          PW6 Indubai Suresh Raut is also residing in the neighbourhood of the deceased and the accused.              During her testimony, initially, she had left the loyalty towards the prosecution, but during cross-examination by learned APP before the Trial Court she admitted that the accused is in a habit of consuming liquor. The accused is hot tempered and quarrelsome nature. He had quarreled with her, her brother, and neighbour Tarabai and also beaten her. She further admitted that the accused used to beat his wife Chhaya under the influence of liquor. She further admitted that due to the nature of the accused she as well as other people residing in that locality were afraid of him.     She further admitted during cross- examination by learned APP before the Trial Court that she and her husband witnessed that the accused was abusing and beating his wife Chhaya on account of burning of meat cury. She assigned the reason that as she was afraid of the accused, she did not visit the house of the accused. It further came in her cross-examination that on the next day she saw Chhaya, the deceased, lying on the floor facing towards sky on the mat in a dead condition.         She also witnessed the injuries over the lips and stomach.       She further testified that when Tarabai (PW5) enquired with Kajal, the daughter of the accused and the deceased, Kajal disclosed that her father had abused and beaten her mother with kick and fist blows on account of burning of meat cury. Thus, from the evidence of PW6 Indubai it reveals that though initially she has not supported the prosecution version, during cross-examination by learned APP before the Trial Court, she narrated the entire incident.    Learned counsel for the defence also cross-examined this witness and it is admitted by her that there were good relationship between the accused and the deceased. She also admitted that as they were sleeping in night, they did not hear any sound of quarrel. Thus, though the defence has cross-examined this witness, the material incident that there was quarrel in the night of the incident between the deceased and the accused, was not shattered. 21.           Thus, the prosecution had relied upon these four witnesses informant PW3 Sunil Suresh Shendre (PW3); accused’s and deceased’s daughter PW4 Kajal Suresh Shendre; accused’s neighbour PW5 Tarabai Suresh Shendre, and accused’s neighbour PW6 Indubai Suresh Raut.      Though these four witnesses have not completely supported the prosecution case, but entire core of their evidence established that the accused was in a habit of drinking liquor and he used to beat the deceased under the influence of liquor. It further proved by the prosecution that on 3.9.2015 in the night hours there was quarrel between the deceased and the accused as the deceased has not prepared meat properly.           It is further proved that the deceased was abused and assaulted by the accused. Learned      counsel  Shri  S.G.Joshi   for  the  appellant vehemently submitted that all these four witnesses have not supported the prosecution case. Besides their evidence, there is no other evidence on record to show that it is the accused who is the perpetrator of the crime.    As already observed that though these witnesses have not supported entirely, however their evidence corroborates the prosecution case that at the relevant time of the incident the deceased was abused and assaulted by the accused and subsequently she was found dead. It is well settled that the law on the treatment of a hostile witness is that the evidence of such a witness need not be completely rejected only because such witness was turned hostile. The Court must, however, be circumspect in accepting their testimony and, to the extent possible, look for its corroboration. 22.          Admittedly, in the present case, there is no direct evidence in the nature of eyewitness. The entire prosecution case is rested on circumstantial evidence.     The circumstances on record show that the deceased is the wife of the accused and at the relevant time they were residing together.         There was quarrel between the deceased and the accused on the night of the incident. The accused was seen with the deceased abusing and assaulting her. Subsequently, she was found dead for which no explanation is put forth by the accused. The death of the deceased as homicidal one is established by the prosecution. 23.          Now, it has to be seen whether the prosecution succeeded in seeking corroboration to the fact that the death of the deceased was caused in the house wherein the deceased and the accused were residing together.       The prosecution adduced the evidence of pancha on spot PW1 Vilas Bhajandas Mungmode.             He testified that on the request of the police, his superior deputed him to act as a pancha. He visited the alleged spot of the incident. In his presence panchanama regarding the spot of incident was drawn. The spot of the incident is situated at the house of Suresh Madhukar Shende i.e the accused. He further observed that there were burnt utensils containing meat cury.     The prosecution case itself shows that the alleged incident had occurred as the deceased has not prepared the meat cury properly. The Investigating Officer has also collected the house extract of the accused which shows that the accused and the deceased are owners of the house.         PW8 Ashwin Bangre and PW9 are photographers who obtained photographs of the spot of incident.      PW11 is Investigating Officer who also narrated about the spot of incident.       Thus, the prosecution has proved that the alleged incident has occurred in the house of the 24.           Another circumstance, on which the prosecution has relied upon, is Chemical Analyzer’s Reports. The Trial Court has not marked the Chemical Analyzer’s Reports giving it exhibit numbers. In view of Section 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Chemical Analyzer’s Reports are admissible in evidence being the reports of the Government Scientific Experts.           The Chemical Analyzer’s Reports show that the incriminating articles wooden log, bangle pieces, clothes of the deceased, and clothes of the accused are sent for its analysis.  As per the Chemical Analyzer’s Reports, articles saree, nicker, blouse, petticoat of the deceased, and jeans pant of the accused are stained with human blood. The blood found on the clothes of the deceased is of Group “A” and the blood group on the jeans pant of the accused cannot be determined as the results are inconclusive. The Honourable Apex Court in the case of Kishor Bhadke vs. State of Maharashtra, reported at 2017 ALL MR 1316 held that the presence of human blood on clothes recovered at the instance of the accused and mere absence of evidence regarding blood group cannot be fatal to the prosecution. But, in the present case, said incriminating circumstance that the blood is found on the clothes of the accused is not put to the accused during the statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and no opportunity is given to the accused to explain the said circumstance and, therefore, the said circumstance cannot be taken into consideration and such evidence is to be ignored. 25.          Admittedly, the present case is rested on circumstantial evidence. The law is settled regarding the circumstantial evidence that the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established.                Those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused. The strong circumstances in the present case against the accused is that the death of the deceased was caused in the matrimonial house when she was residing with the accused.    The Honourable Apex Court in the case of Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra, reported at (2006) ALL MR (Cri) 3510 held that if an offence takes place inside the privacy of a house and in such circumstances where the assailants have all the opportunity to plan and commit the offence at the time and in circumstances of their choice, it will be extremely difficult for the prosecution to lead evidence to establish the guilt of the accused if the strict principle of circumstantial evidence, as noticed above, is insisted upon by the Courts.       It is further held that where an accused is alleged to have committed the murder of his wife and the prosecution succeeds in leading evidence to show that shortly before the commission of crime they were seen together or the offence takes placed in the dwelling home where the husband also normally resided, it has been consistently held that if the accused does not offer any explanation how the wife received injuries or offers an explanation which is found to be false, it is a strong circumstance which indicates that he is responsible for commission of  the   crime.     Section  106   of  the  Evidence   Act,  in   such circumstances, comes into play. When the prosecution proves the chain of circumstances, burden is shifted on the accused to explain or offer explanation regarding the death of the deceased. The said Section, lays down Rule that when the accused does not throw any light upon facts which are especially within his knowledge, and which could not support any theory or hypothesis compatible with innocence, the Court can consider his failure to adduce any explanation, as an additional link which completes the chain. 26.          We have considered submissions and appreciated the evidence on record on the principles laid down by the Honourable Apex Court. In that context, the evidence of informant PW3 Sunil Suresh Shendre, accused’s neighbour PW5 Tarabai Suresh Shendre and another neighbour PW6 Indubai Suresh Raut is very important. Their evidence shows that prior to death of the deceased, the deceased and the accused were seen together.        The accused was seen abusing and assaulting the deceased. The quarrel was going on   as  the  deceased    had   not  prepared  the   meat    properly. Subsequently, the deceased was found dead. The accused has not offered any explanation. The spot of the incident shows that stick was lying there which was seized     by the police.   Informant PW1 had witnessed the burnt utensils containing meat cury which supports the story of the prosecution.    The medical evidence also shows that the deceased died due to the injuries that is external and internal sustained by her. The defence of the accused that the deceased fallen on the ground due to Epilepsy stroke is ruled out by the Medical Officer and the defence has not produced any document to show that the deceased was suffering from Epilepsy.              The subsequent conduct of the accused is also material that he has not informed the incident to the police or the relatives immediately. Thus, the entire evidence on record sufficiently shows that the death of the deceased was caused in the house of the accused due to the assault by the accused on account of not preparing the food 27.          Learned   counsel    Shri S.G.Joshi   for  the  appellant submitted that though the case of the prosecution is taken as it is, there was no intention to kill the deceased.       He submitted that whatever happened was in a spur of moment. It was a sudden fight and a sudden quarrel and, therefore, the case of the accused covers under exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, the case of the accused covers under the culpable homicide not amounting to murder. 28.          So far as the intention of the accused is concerned, the nature   of  intention   has   to   be  gathered   from   surrounding circumstances like kind of weapon used, the amount of force used, the part of the body hit and the circumstances attendant upon death. Admittedly, direct evidence would not be available to gather the intention as the intention is the inner compartment of that person’s mind. 29.           Whether    the   case   of the  accused,   covers    under exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, a sudden fight and a sudden quarrel is to be seen from circumstances. Admittedly, there was quarrel between the accused and the deceased on account of meat which was not properly cooked and the accused lost his self control and assaulted the deceased. The exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code covers acts done in a sudden fight. The said exception deals with a case of the prosecution not covered by the first exception, after which its place would have been more appropriate.       Exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code deals only if there is heat of passion, the person acts while losing his self control.    It deals with cases in which a blow may have been struck or some provocation given in the origin of the disputes. A sudden fight implies a mutual provocation. The help of exception 4 of the said Section can be invoked if death is caused, (a) without premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight, (c) without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner, and (d) the fight must have been without the person killed. 30.          Here, in the present case, the facts on record show that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. The injuries sustained by the deceased were not on the vital parts of her body.    Admittedly, there were six injuries on the person of the deceased which were in the nature of contusions and internal injuries.  The weapon like stick was used.     The evidence nowhere shows that the accused acted in a cruel manner. The weapon like stick was used in the assault. 31.          The culpable homicide is defined in Section 299 of the Indian Penal Code whereas murder is defined in Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code.      The every act of homicide falls within the definition of culpable homicide in Section 299 of the Indian Penal Code.    As per Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, homicide is murder. However, there are five exceptions in the said Section and those exceptions lay down the circumstances in which the act causing death is not murder even though it may have been done with the intention or knowledge specified in Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code. Therefore, it has to be seen whether there was intention or knowledge with which the act was done and what are 32.          Admittedly, in the present case, the quarrel was taken place on a simple reason that the deceased had not prepared the meat properly and the accused lost his self control and gave a blow of stick on the person of the deceased.     For considering, whether the case would fall under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code or lesser and for finding out nature of intention one has to take into consideration the kind of weapon used.       Admittedly, the accused had not prepared for the assault. When he saw that the deceased had not prepared the food, he abused and assaulted her.            The weapon used in the present case is a lethal weapon like stick. In this view of the matter, we find that the appellant had knowledge that injuries could cause death of the deceased.       There was an intention on the part of the the accused to cause injuries. However, the accused had not taken undue advantage or has not acted in a cruel or unusual manner.     Considering the factual scenario in the background of the position in law, inevitable conclusion is that the act of the accused would cover under exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, the case of the accused would cover under Section 304 Part-I of the Indian Penal Code. 33.          In view of the discussion above, no case for acquittal is made out.    However, the case of the appellant would cover under Section 304 Part-I of the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, the appeal deserves to be allowed partly and the appellant need not undergo imprisonment for life and his sentence can be modified by ordering that he shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years. Hence, we proceed to pass following order: (1) The criminal appeal is allowed partly. (2)   Judgment and order dated 20.7.2017 passed by learned Additional   Sessions    Judge,   Chandrapur    in  Sessions     Case No.111/2015 stands confirmed to the extent of imposing conviction of the offence punishable under Section 304(I) of the Indian Penal (3) Judgment and order dated 20.7.2017 passed by learned Additional   Sessions    Judge,   Chandrapur    in  Sessions     Case No.111/2015 stands quashed and set aside to the extent of imposing sentence to suffer imprisonment for life. (4)  Instead,   the  appellant   is  sentenced   to suffer  rigorous imprisonment for ten years. (5) No orders as regards payment of fine amount. (6) The appellant is entitled for set-off under Section 428 of the (7) As is permissible in law, fees to be received by learned counsel Shri S.G.Joshi appointed for the appellant from the High Court Legal Services Sub Committee at Nagpur are quantified. The criminal appeal is disposed of accordingly. BHUSHAN        by BHUSHAN
At the outset, be it noted, it is settled law that “a jurisdiction can neither be waived nor created even by consent and even by submitting to jurisdiction, an Assessee cannot confer upon any jurisdictional authority, something which he lacked inherently”. The said ratio squarely applies to the case on hand. 2. The appellant is an assessee on the file of the second respondent. For the assessment year 2011-2012, she filed her return of income on 19.04.2012 admitting an income of Rs.11,60,000/-, which was processed by the Assessing Officer under Section 143 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short, “the Act”). While so, after a period of five years, she received a notice dated 28.03.2018 issued by the first respondent under Section 148 of the Act purportedly to re-assess the income of return submitted by her for the assessment year 2011-2012. In response, she submitted a reply dated 26.04.2018 stating that the first respondent has no jurisdiction to issue such a notice under Section 148 of the Act and therefore, she requested to drop the reassessment proceedings. Subsequently, the first respondent transferred the files pertaining to the appellant to the second respondent. Thereafter, the second respondent continued the reassessment proceedings by issuing a notice dated 14.12.2018 under section 143(2) r/w 129 of the Act, directing the appellant to appear and file return of income to the notice under section 148 of the Act along with supportive documents. Aggrieved over the same, the appellant preferred WP.No.34136 of 2018 to quash both the notices dated 28.03.2018 and 14.12.2018 issued by the respective respondents 1 and 2. 3. It was contended by the respondents before the writ court that the appellant had received a sum of Rs.53,50,000/- towards her share in respect of the property at Mumbai, from a developer within the jurisdiction of the first respondent and therefore, notice dated 28.03.2018 under section 148 of the Act was issued by the first respondent. When the appellant raised an issue of jurisdiction, the entire materials collected by the first respondent were sent to the second respondent for continuing the reassessment proceedings. Accordingly, the second respondent seized of the reassessment proceedings within whose jurisdiction the appellant resides. According to the respondents, in the original assessment proceedings for the assessment year 2011-2012, it was not known as to whether the appellant had disclosed the said sum of Rs.53,50,000/- received by her towards transfer of FSI rights in respect of the property situated at Mumbai and therefore, she was directed to appear before the second respondent and explain the same. In any event, there is tangible material evidence available to initiate reassessment proceedings against the appellant. 4. Upon hearing both sides, the learned Judge, having observed that the notice initially issued by the first respondent against the appellant though improper, need not be set aside, in view of the fact that the said proceedings were subsequently transferred to the Income Tax Authorities at Chennai; the commencement of the proceedings by issuing notice dated 14.12.2018 is in no way prejudiced the appellant; and she is at liberty to file her objections and avail an opportunity of hearing to be provided under the IT Act, dismissed the said writ petition, by the order impugned herein. Therefore, the appellant / writ petitioner is before this court with this appeal. 5.1. The learned counsel for the appellant would contend that the first respondent lacks jurisdiction to initiate the reassessment proceedings by issuing the notice dated 28.03.2018 knowing fully well that the appellant is not residing within the jurisdiction of the first respondent. Further, after a period of five years from the completion of the original assessment for the assessment year 2011-2012, the reassessment proceedings were initiated, alleging that some of the income was not disclosed by the appellant truly and fully. However, the fact remains that there was no income omitted to be included by the appellant for assessment during the assessment year in question. Therefore, the reassessment proceedings ought not to have been initiated by the first respondent against the appellant. 5.2. Adding further, the learned counsel for the appellant contended that when the reassessment proceedings initiated by the first respondent itself is invalid, the second respondent without issuing notice afresh under section 148 of the Act, cannot be permitted to continue the further proceedings by issuing notice dated 14.12.2018 invoking Section 129 of the Act. According to the learned counsel, even assuming that the reassessment proceedings are valid, as per Section 149 (b) of the Act, the second respondent cannot issue a notice under Section 148 of the Act beyond the period of six years from the end of the relevant assessment year. It is also submitted that the limitation period for initiation of reassessment proceedings for the assessment year 2011-12 came to an end on 31.03.2018; the second respondent, who is the jurisdictional assessing officer, did not issue any notice under Section 148 of the Act, before 31.03.2018 to reopen the return of income declared by the appellant; and therefore, the second respondent cannot ride upon the borrowed satisfaction of the first respondent to continue with the reassessment proceedings without issuance of notice under section 148 of the Act within the prescribed time frame, which vitiate the entire reassessment proceedings. However, the learned Judge erred in observing that there is no irregularity or infirmity in initiating the reassessment proceedings by the first respondent by issuing notice dated 28.03.2018 and transmitting the files to the second respondent, who in turn, issued notice dated 14.12.2018 for continuation of the reassessment proceedings; and dismissing the writ petition, by the order impugned herein. 5.3. The learned counsel placed reliance on the decisions of various High Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court and ultimately, submitted that when once the initiation of the reassessment proceedings is without jurisdiction and held to be invalid, the other consequential proceedings must also necessarily held to be invalid; and therefore, the writ appeal will have to be allowed, by setting aside the order impugned herein and the notices impugned in the writ petition. 6. Opposing this appeal, the learned Senior Panel Counsel appearing for the respondents would contend that the reassessment proceedings were initiated by issuing notice under section 148 of the Act by the first respondent inasmuch as the particulars relating to the PAN number of the appellant were not available and the details about the developer, who had made payment to the appellant, were not furnished. However, when the issue of jurisdiction was raised by the appellant, the first respondent transferred the entire files relating to the reassessment proceedings of the appellant to the second respondent. The appellant, without filing her return of income to the notice under section 148 of the Act for the relevant assessment year to the second respondent, approached this Court invoking Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Even in the writ proceedings, the appellant did not state anything about the amount received by her. Therefore, the learned Judge justified the notices issued by the respondents and rightly dismissed the writ petition, granting liberty to the appellant to submit her objections to the notice dated 14.12.2018 issued by the second respondent and also avail an opportunity of personal hearing to be provided. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the order of the learned Judge does not require any interference at the hands of this court. 7. Heard both sides and perused the materials available on record. 8. The subject matter of challenge before the writ court was the notice dated 28.03.2018 issued by the first respondent under section 148 of the Act and the consequential notice dated 14.12.2018 issued by the second respondent under section 143(2) r/w 129 of the Act, for the assessment year 2011-12. The learned Judge decided the same against the appellant / writ petitioner. 9. In this writ appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant made elaborate contentions both on legal and factual aspects. Firstly, in law, it is submitted that the first respondent lacks jurisdiction to issue reassessment notice under section 148 of the Act; when the same was pointed out by the appellant, the first respondent transferred the entire files to the jurisdictional assessing officer / second respondent, who inturn, continued the reassessment proceedings by issuing notice under section 143(2) r/w 129 of the Act, without issuing any fresh notice under section 148 of the Act; and hence, the notices so issued by the respective respondents are invalid and the same vitiate the reassessment proceedings. Secondly, on facts, it is contended that the appellant disclosed fully and truly all the material facts necessary for her assessment for the relevant assessment year and there was no income omitted to be included by way of reassessment proceedings. However, the learned Judge failed to appreciate the same in a proper perspective and erred in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant herein. 10. On the other hand, the learned senior panel counsel appearing for the respondents reiterating the averments made in the counter affidavit, justified the reassessment proceedings initiated by the respondents against the appellant, as affirmed by the learned Judge in the writ petition. 11. Before proceeding further, it is but relevant to refer to the provisions of law, based on which the notices impugned in the writ petition were issued by the respondent authorities, viz., section 148 and 129 of the Act, as follows: “Issue of notice where income has escaped assessment 148.(1)Before making the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147, the Assessing Officer shall serve on the assessee a notice requiring him to furnish within such period as may be specified in the notice, a return of his income or the income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable under this Act during the previous year corresponding to the relevant assessment year, in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed; and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if such return were a return required to be furnished under section 139: (a)Where a return has been furnished during the period commencing on the 1st day of October, 1991 and ending on the 30th day of September, 2005 in response to a notice served under this section, and (b)Subsequently a notice has been served under sub-section (2) of section 143 after the expiry of twelve months specified in the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 143, as it stood immediately before the amendment of said sub-section by the Finance Act, 2002 (20 of 2002) but before the expiry of the time limit for making the assessment, re- assessment or recomputation as specified in sub-section (2) of section 153, every such notice referred to in this clause shall be deemed to be a valid Provided further that in a case - https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis     (a)Where a return has been furnished during the period commencing on the 1st day of October, 1991 and ending on the 30th day of September, 2005, in response to a notice served under this section, and (b)subsequently a notice has been served under clause (ii) of sub section (2) of section 143 after the expiry of twelve months specified in the proviso to clause (ii) of sub-section (2) of section 143, but before the expiry of the time limit for making the assessment, reassessment or recomputation as specified in sub-section (2) of section 153, every such notice referred to in this clause shall be deemed to be a valid notice.] [Explanation.- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that nothing contained in the first proviso or the second proviso shall apply to any return which has been furnished on or after the 1 st day of October, 2005 in response to a notice served under this section.] (2)The Assessing Officer shall, before issuing any notice under this section, record his reasons for doing so.” 129.Whenever in respect of any proceeding under this Act an income-tax authority ceases to exercise jurisdiction and is succeeded by another who has and exercises jurisdiction, the income-tax authority so succeeding may continue the proceeding from the stage at which the proceeding was left by his predecessor: Provided that the assessee concerned my demand that before the proceeding is so continued the previous proceeding or any part thereof be reopened or that before any order of assessment is passed against him, he be reheard.” On a plain reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is apparent that section 148 provides for issuance of notice where income has escaped assessment and the assessing officer intends to make assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147. Under sub-section (1) to section 148, the assessing officer shall issue notice to the assessee requiring him/her to furnish a return of income in respect of which he/she is assessable for the relevant assessment year; and under sub-section (2) to section 148, the assessing officer shall before issuing any notice under this section, record his reasons for doing so. It is also crystal clear from the provisions of section 129 of the Act that the same is applicable, when there is a change of incumbent without any change of jurisdiction and one Assessing Officer is succeeded by another in the same office. 12. In the instant case, it could be seen that the assessment of the appellant was reopened upon receipt of credible information from the Directorate of Income Tax (I & CI), Mumbai, to the effect that she received a sum of Rs.53,50,000/- for transfer of her FSI right in the property at Mumbai. Pursuant to the same, the first respondent issued notice dated 28.03.2018 under section 148 of the Act stating that he has reasons to believe that the income of the appellant chargeable to tax for the assessment year 2011-12 has escaped assessment within the meaning of section 147 of the Act; and therefore, he proposed to assess/re-assess the income for the said assessment year and he directed the appellant to file her return of income in the prescribed form within 30 days from the service of notice. Upon receipt of the said notice, the appellant in her reply dated 26.04.2018, pointed out that she is a permanent resident of Chennai and her PAN is AAKPK7417K and an assessee on the file of the second respondent; and she therefore, requested the first respondent to drop the proposal. Consequently, the files pertaining to the reassessment of the appellant were transmitted to the second respondent. Thereafter, without issuing any fresh notice under section 148 of the Act, the second respondent / jurisdictional assessing officer continued the reassessment proceedings initiated by the first respondent, who lacks jurisdiction to issue notice under section 148 of the Act, and sent a notice dated 14.12.2018 under section 143(2) r/w section 129 of the Act to the appellant, calling upon her to appear either in person or through an authorised representative and produce the documents in support of the return of income filed by her. Thus, both the notices issued by the respondents 1 and 2 respectively were challenged by the appellant. 13. Reference was made by the learned counsel for the appellant to the (i)Shibani Dutta v. Commissioner of Income-tax [(2012) 26 taxmann.com 105 (Delhi), in which, it was held as under: “10....The period of limitation gets extended under clause (iii) of Explanation I only by the time taken to reopen the whole or any part of the proceeding or giving an opportunity to the assessee (to be reheard) under the proviso to Section 129. If we turn to section 129 of the Act we find that it provides for the procedure to be followed when there is a “change of incumbent of an office”. ... 11.We do not see how this provision helps the Revenue. It is applicable when in the same jurisdiction, there is a change of incumbent and one Assessing Officer is succeeded by another. In such a case, the main Section provides that the successor – officer is entitled to continue the proceeding from the stage at which it was left by his predecessor subject to the caveat, expressed in the proviso, that if the assessee demands that before the proceeding is continued the previous proceedings or any part thereof shall be reopened or that before any assessment order is passed against him, he shall be reheard, such a demand has to be accepted. If as a result of accepting the assessee's demand under the proviso to section 129 some time is taken and the assessment proceedings cannot be completed within the normal period of limitation, then the period of limitation gets extended by such time taken for giving the assessee an opportunity to reopen the earlier proceedings or for rehearing. Section 129 is applicable to normal assessments made under section 143(3) of the Act as well as the block assessments made under section 158BC of the (ii)Commissioner of Income-tax v. M.I.Builders (P) Ltd [(2014) 44 taxmann.com 360 (Allahabad)], wherein, it was observed as follows: “17.Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records, we are of the view that on 29.3.2004, when the notice under section 148(1) of the Act was issued, ACIT, Range-IV, Lucknow have no jurisdiction over the Assessee on the date of issuance of such notice as the jurisdiction over the Assessee was transferred to the Additional CIT, Range-I, Lucknow vide order dated 1.8.2001 passed under section 120 of the Act by the CCIT, Lucknow. Therefore, it cannot be situation where two Assessing Officer would have simultaneous jurisdiction over the assessee, one being Additional CIT, Range-I, Lucknow and other being ACIT, Range-IV, Lucknow. In these backgrounds, the Tribunal has rightly held that the issuance of notice under section 148(1) of the Act by the ACIT, Range-IV, Lucknow was without jurisdiction.” (iii)Pr.Commisioner of Income Tax-II Lucknow v. Mohd. Rizwan Prop. M/s.M.R.Garments Moulviganj [ITA No.100 of 2015 dated 30.03.2017], in which, it was held as under: “34.Section 148 clearly talks of issue of notice by A.O. Meaning thereby, A.O. having jurisdiction over Assessee. In fact, it is his satisfaction which is to be recorded for justifying reopening of assessment / reassessment proceedings as contemplated under section 147 and recording of reasons for the same purpose is mandatory. The satisfaction of A.O. could not have been hired or be delegated to any other authority.” “43.The reason for issuance of notice by Competent A.O. is quite obvious inasmuch as such notice could have been issued only when concerned A.O. has reason to believe that some income has escaped assessment and recomputation / reassessment is needed. Now such satisfaction can be of that A.O. only who has jurisdiction in the matter and not of any third party. 44.We, therefore, hold that in the present case, no valid notice under section 148 was issued by Jurisdictional A.O before making assessment / reassessment and, therefore, proceedings of reassessment pursuant to notice issued under section 148 by an incompetent officer are void and ab initio.” (iv)Pankajbhai Jaysukhlal Shah v. Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax Circle 2 [(2019)110 taxmann.com.51 (Gujarat), which was affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax Circle-2 v. Pankajbhai Jaysukhlal Shah [(2020) 120 taxmann.com 318 (SC)] and the ratio laid down therein is as follows: “10.....while the reasons for reopening the assessment have been recorded by the jurisdictional Assessing Officer viz., the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle-2, Jamnagar, the impugned notice under section 148(1) of the Act has been issued by the Income Tax Officer, Ward 2(2), Jamnagar who had no jurisdiction over the petitioner and hence, such notice was bad on the count of having been issued by an officer who had not authority in law to issue such notice. As a necessary corollary it follows that no proceedings could have been taken under section 147 of the Act in pursuance of such invalid notice. In the aforesaid premises, the impugned notice under section 148(1) of the Act as well as all the proceedings taken pursuant thereto cannot be sustained.” The legal proposition laid down in the aforesaid decisions is that “notice under section 148 is mandatory to reopen/ reassess the income of the assessee and such a notice should have been issued by the competent assessing officer, who has jurisdiction”; “The jurisdictional Assessing Officer, who records the reasons for reopening the assessment as contemplated under sub section (2) of section 148, has to issue notice under section 148(1), then only, such a notice issued under section 148(1) would be a valid notice”; “The officer recording the reasons under section 148(2) of the Act and the officer issuing notice under section 148(1) has to be the same person”; “Section 129 is applicable when in the same jurisdiction, there is a change of incumbent and one assessing officer is succeeded by another”; and “when once the initiation of reassessment proceedings is held to be invalid, whatever follows thereafter must also, necessarily be invalid”. 14. Applying the provisions of law as well as the legal proposition laid down in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the present case, wherein, admittedly, the appellant is an assessee on the file of the second respondent and hence, the first respondent has no jurisdiction over the appellant to issue notice under section 148 for reopening the assessment for the relevant assessment year, after recording the reasons to believe that some of the income of the appellant has escaped assessment, this court is of the opinion that the notice dated 28.03.2018 issued by the first respondent under section 148 of the Act, without jurisdiction, lacks legal sanctity and hence, the same is held to be invalid. As a sequitur, the continuation of the reassessment proceedings by the second respondent, who is the jurisdictional assessing officer, without issuing any fresh notice as contemplated under section 148, but issuing notice dated 14.12.2018 under section 143(2) r/w 129 of the Act, which applies only for change in incumbent within the same jurisdiction, is also held to be invalid. 15. Pertinently, it is to be pointed out at this stage that “if an order is passed by a judicial or quasi-judicial authority having no jurisdiction, it is an obligation of Appellate Court to rectify the error and set aside the order passed by the authority or forum having no jurisdiction” [Refer: State of Gujarat v. Rajesh Kumar Chimanlal Barot and another, AIR 1996 SC 2664]. Therefore, the notice issued by the first respondent under section 148 as well as the consequential notice issued by the second respondent under section 143(2) r/w 129, cannot be allowed to be sustained. However, the learned Judge erred in directing the second respondent to continue the reassessment proceedings and granting liberty to the appellant to file objections and avail the opportunity of personal hearing to be provided, by the order impugned herein, which is liable to be set aside, in the considered view of this court. 16. As already held by this court, the first respondent, who recorded the reasons for reopening the assessment under section 148(2), has no jurisdiction over the appellant, to issue notice dated 28.03.2018 under section 148(1). Though the files pertaining to the reassessment proceedings of the appellant were transferred, the second respondent has no authority to continue the reassessment proceedings under section 129 and hence, the notice dated 14.12.2018 issued by him is also held to be invalid. The invalid notices so issued by the respondents vitiate the entire reassessment proceedings initiated against the appellant. Admittedly, no notice under section 148 was issued by the second respondent, who is the jurisdictional assessing officer, for reassessment of the return of income of the appellant, within the time frame stipulated under the Act. In this case, the limitation period of six years for reopening the assessment for the year 2011-12 under section 147 of the Act, came to an end on 31.03.2018. In such circumstances, there is no requirement for this court to go into the other issue based on the factual matrix projected by the appellant i.e., whether the appellant has disclosed fully and truly all the material particulars that are necessary for assessment for the relevant assessment year. 17. In the ultimate analysis, the writ appeal stands allowed by setting aside the notices impugned in the writ petition and the order impugned herein. No costs. Consequently connected miscellaneous petition is closed. 1. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax-23(2), Mumbai

MEP Infrastructure Developers Limited (“MEPIDL”) is at loggerheads with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (“MCD”; previously the South Delhi Municipal Corporation).

Writ Petition No. 8677 of 2022 is by the MCD, (“the MCD Petition”). 2.     In the MEPIDL Petition, the prayers after amendment are “a.

The MEPIDL Petition is against several Respondents, 12 in all, including the MCD, its Commissioners, two banks and then, importantly for our purposes, the District Magistrate at Chandivali, Powai, the Tahsildar Executive Magistrate, Kalyan, the Tahsildar Executive Magistrature at Kurla. Also joined as Respondents by an amendment are the District Collector Mumbai Suburban and the District Collector Thane. In the MCD Petition, the Respondents are MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors apart from the State of Maharashtra, the District Collector at Thane, one of the banks and MEPIDL. 5.     A compact statement of facts may be taken from the MCD Petition. The MCD is a statutory body. Its governing statute is the Amongst its various functions, the MCD collects toll tax from commercial vehicles entering Delhi from as many as 1024 toll gates or entry points around Delhi. This is said to be one of the principal sources of revenue for all municipal corporations of Delhi. 6.     The MCD says that it does not itself have in-house manpower to collect toll tax at these various collection points. It cannot monitor the quite considerable daily cash collections. The work is thus contracted out on a lumpsum basis to various third parties. This is done under the Delhi Municipal (Toll Tax) Bye-Laws 2007, which are to be read with Section 113 of the DMC Act. 7.     According to the MCD, MEPIDL, a Mumbai-based enterprise, made a bid for collection of toll tax from all MCD toll gates/check posts at the many entry points into Delhi. The parties executed a contract on 28th September 2017. We note at the forefront that we are not concerned in these Petitions with the merits of the disputes arising from that contract. It is enough to note that the contract required MEPIDL to make a specified weekly remittance to the MCD. This was expressed also in terms of an annual remittance and was subject to a periodic enhancement. Other remittances were also to be made. According to MCD, an MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors amount of about Rs. 100 crores was to be paid monthly towards toll tax. The contract in question required MEPIDL to recover other charges such as environment compensation charges, and these too had to be remitted to the MCD. 8.      MCD’s case is that MEPIDL failed to make these remittances. A large amount fell due. The contract itself provided for a penalty. MCD imposed that penalty. It also served several demand notices amount by various communications from 3rd November 2017 till 14th February 2021. 9.      There seemed to be no resolution to these disputes. MCD terminated the contract by a notice dated 16th March 2020. 10.     The scene now shifts to MEPIDL’s dispute about the termination and the MCD’s demands. This took place in the Delhi High Court where MEPIDL filed a Writ Petition challenging the termination. That was dismissed on 9th April 2021. We are told there is a Letters Patent Appeal pending against that order. Again, this is not our concern except to the limited extent to note that the matter is squarely within the seisin of the Delhi High Court. 11.     On 10th April 2021, according to the MCD, MEPIDL was indebted to the MCD in an amount of nearly Rs. 4,000/- crores. Mr Joshi for MCD says that figure has gone up considerably since. 12.     The disputed question is this. MCD has set about recovering its claim. MEPIDL is not a Delhi-based enterprise. It has no assets MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors in Delhi. But it has considerable assets, both movable and immovable, within the jurisdiction of this Court. MCD has also moved in distraint and issued distress warrants. One of these was sought to be challenged by MEPIDL before the Delhi High Court. No stay was granted. MEPIDL says it has withdrawn that challenge petition to the distress warrant, a statement that MCD disputes. 13.    This brings us now to the frame of the MEPIDL Petition because what MCD did was to move against MEPIDL’s assets within the jurisdiction of this Court. It did so by requesting, in the manner that we will shortly describe, the local authorities to issue notices of attachment of MEPIDL’s assets within this Court’s jurisdiction. The request was for attachment of both movable and immovable properties. The movable properties seem to be bank accounts with one or the other of the Respondent banks. At least one of these banks has been unusually friendly to MEPIDL: rather than acting on the Tehsildar’s notice demanding a freezing of the accounts, it invited MEPIDL to explain why that action should not be taken. 14.    The argument by MEPIDL represented by Mr Dhond relates principally to the two notices at Exhibits “A1” and “A2” to the MEPIDL Petition. From the prayers that we have set out above, it is clear that the relief is also sought in respect of the warrants of distress. Mr Dhond clarifies that only one warrant of distress was challenged before the Delhi High Court. Mr Joshi says that the others have never been challenged elsewhere. In any case, Mr Dhond also says that the challenge to the warrants of distress is to MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors the extent that they seek to move against properties, both movable and immovable, within the jurisdiction of this Court. He also states that the challenge to a solitary warrant of distress filed before the Delhi High Court has been withdrawn. This is disputed. 15.    We decline to enter into that controversy. For the reasons that follow, we decline to embark on an adjudication of the warrants of 16.    Exhibits “A1” and “A2” are at pages 56 and 59 of the MEPIDL Petition. Exhibit “A1” is dated 28th October 2021. This is a communication from the Tahsildar and the Executive Magistrate Kalyan to the Manager of the State Bank of India and the Manager of the Dombivli Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd to freeze two accounts noted in that letter. Exhibit “A2” is of 16th November 2021. It notes that there is a Revenue Recovery Certificate and says that if the demand is not paid, the amount of the Revenue Recovery Certificate will be recovered as arrears of land revenue under the Maharashtra 17.    Mr Dhond maintains that the Writ Petition squarely lies within the jurisdiction of this Court. He invites attention to Article 226 (2) of the Constitution of India. We reproduce Article 226 of “226. Power of High Courts to issue certain writs.— (1)     Notwithstanding anything in Article 32 every High Court shall have powers, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercise jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibitions, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose. (2) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any Government, authority or person may also be exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the residence of such person is not within those territories. (3)      Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner, is made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1), without— (a)    furnishing to such party copies of such petition and all documents in support of the plea for such interim order; and (b)    giving such party an opportunity of being makes an application to the High Court for the vacation of such order and furnishes a copy of such application to the party in whose favour such order has been made or the counsel of such party, the High Court shall dispose of the application within a period of two weeks from the date on which it is received or from the date on which the copy of such application is so furnished, whichever is later, or where the High Court is closed on the last day of that period, before the expiry of the next day afterwards on which the High Court is open; and if the application is not so disposed of, the interim order shall, on the expiry of that period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the aid next day, MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors (4)     The power conferred on a High Court by this article shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme Court by clause (2) of article 32.” (Emphasis added) 18.    It is true that the Respondent Tehsildar is within the jurisdiction of this Court and that the properties in question, both movable and immovable, are also within the jurisdiction of this Court. According to Mr Dhond, since the action is brought against those properties, it can safely be said that the cause of action, or at least a part of it, arises within the jurisdiction of the Court. It makes no difference that the demand on which the impugned action is based originates from outside the jurisdiction of this Court. 19.    Mr Joshi for his part says that this is a misreading of Article 226(2). The entirety of Article 226 confers an equitable and a discretionary power on the High Court to issue a high prerogative writ remedy. Sub-article (2) was introduced by the 15th amendment as Article 226(1-A) and then, by the 42nd Amendment, in its present form. It allows High Courts to exercise their discretionary jurisdiction even when the originating authority is beyond that High Court’s jurisdiction. But this does not mean that in every case, a High Court must exercise its jurisdiction, i.e., that the equitable discretion is taken away. Article 226(2) is an expansion of a High Court’s writ jurisdiction, not a fetter on it. Surely equitable considerations must be a factor. It is his submission that there is really no jurisdictional remit of this Court to be exercised under Article 226(2). The act of the Tahsildar in issuing the impugned MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors notices are purely ministerial acts, giving effect to a Revenue Recovery Certificate and to the warrants of distress. Those warrants were all issued in Delhi under a Delhi statute. No part of the cause of action relatable to the warrants of distress arises within the jurisdiction of this Court; and, therefore, there is no call for interference with the impugned notices. 20.    Mr Joshi is at some pains to submit that we should not enter into the merits of the case, i.e., the actual dispute as MCD’s claim and MEPIDL’s liability. We agree it is not for us to decide whether that debt is or is not due and whether the claim of the MCD is or is not justified. There is no dispute that there are warrants of distress and that these have been issued from Delhi. 21.    Jurisdictionally, the warrants of distress and the impugned notices are distinct. The impugned notices are based on the warrants of distress. The notices originate in this Court’s jurisdiction. The warrants of distress do not. The fact that the warrants of distress resulted in the impugned notices does not, in and of itself mean that we should exercise our discretion in regard to those distress warrants. 22.    Mr Dhond would next have it that unless it is shown that the claim of the MCD is revenue, no revenue authority can purport to exercise powers for recovery of the amount claimed as “arrears of land revenue”. It is his case that this is a money claim, pure and simple. At best it is a tax. It is in no sense, he submits, recoverable as arrears of land revenue. MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors 23.   To understand the controversy, we must consider certain provisions of the applicable statute. There is, first, the DMC Act. There are also the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Toll Tax) Bye- Laws 2007 (“the Toll Tax Bye-Laws”). The DMC Act has a separate chapter on taxation, Chapter VIII. Section 113 sets out the taxes to be imposed by the Corporation under the Act. The list includes a tax on vehicles under sub-section (1). Under sub-section 2(g) of section 113, tolls are specifically enumerated as one species of tax. Then sub-section (3) says that the taxes specified in sub- sections (1) and (2) are to be assessed and collected in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the Bye-Laws made thereunder. 24.   We turn to Sections 156, 157 and 158 of the DMC Act: “156. Recovery of tax— (1)      If the person liable for the payment of the tax does not, within thirty days from the service of the notice of demand, pay the amount due, such sum together with all costs and the penalty provided for in section 155, may be recovered under a warrant, issued in the form set forth in the Eighth Schedule, by distress and sale of the movable property or the attachment and sale of the immovable property, of the defaulter: Provided that the Commissioner shall not recover any sum the liability for which has been remitted on appeal under the provisions of this Act. (2)      Every warrant issued under this section shall be signed by the Commissioner. (1)      It shall be lawful for any officer or other employees of the Corporation to whom a warrant issued MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors under section 156 is addressed to distrain, wherever it may be found in any place in Delhi, any movable property or any standing timber, growing crops or grass belonging to the person therein named as defaulter, subject to the following conditions, exceptions and exemptions, (a)     the following property shall not be distrained: (i)     the necessary wearing apparel and bedding of the defaulter, his wife and children and their cooking and eating (ii)    tools of artisans; (iv)    when the defaulter is an agriculturist his implements of husbandry, seed, necessary to enable the defaulter to earn his livelihood; (b)     the distress shall not be excessive, that is to say, the property distrained shall be as nearly as possible equal in value to the amount recoverable under the warrant, and if any property has been distrained which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, should not have been distrained, it shall forthwith be released. (2)      The person charged with execution of a warrant of distress shall forthwith make an inventory of the property which he seizes under such warrant, and shall, at the same time, give a written notice in the form set forth in the Ninth Schedule, to the person in possession thereof at the time of seizure that the said property will be sold as therein mentioned. MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors 158. Disposal of distrained property and attachment and sale of immovable property— (1)      When the property seized is subject to speedy and natural decay or when the expense of keeping it in custody is, when added to the amount to the recovered, likely to exceed its value, the Commissioner shall give notice to the person in whose possession the property was at the time of seizure that it will be sold at once, and shall sell it accordingly by public auction unless the amount mentioned in the warrant is forthwith paid. (2)      If the warrant is not in the meantime suspended by the Commissioner, or discharged, the property seized shall, after the expiry of the period named in the notice served under sub-section (2) of section 157, be sold by public auction by order of the Commissioner. (3) When a warrant is issued for the attachment and sale of immovable property, the attachment shall be made by an order prohibiting the defaulter from transferring or charging the property in any way, and all persons from taking any benefit from such transfer or charge, and declaring that such property would be sold unless the amount of tax due with all costs of recovery is paid into the municipal office within fifteen days from the date of the attachment. (4) Such order shall be proclaimed at some place on or adjacent to such property by beat of drum or other customary mode and a copy of the order shall be affixed on a conspicuous part of the property and upon a conspicuous part of the municipal office and also, when the property is land paying revenue to the Government, in the office of the collector. (5)      Any transfer of or charge on the property attached or any interest therein made without written permission of the Commissioner shall be void as against all claims of the MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors Corporation enforceable under the attachment. (6)     The surplus of the sale-proceeds, if any shall, immediately after the sale of the property, be credited to the Municipal Fund, and notice of such credit shall be given at the same time to the person whose property has been sold or his legal representative and if the same is claimed by written application to the Commissioner within one year from the date of the notice, a refund thereof shall be made to such person or representative. (7)     Any surplus not claimed within one year as aforesaid shall be the property of the Corporation. (8)     For every distraint and attachment made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, a fee of such amount not exceeding two and-a-half per cent. of the amount of the tax due as shall in each case be fixed by the Commissioner, shall be charged, and the said fee shall be included in the costs of recovery.” 25.    Section 156(1) mentions recovery under a warrant issued in a form set out in the Eighth Schedule by distress and sale of immovable property or the attachment and sale of the immovable property of the defaulter. Section 157(1) is a provision on which Mr Dhond lays much emphasis. This speaks of a distraint. According to Mr Dhond, therefore, Section 157(1) controls and limits Section 156(1): a distress warrant must be confined to property of the descriptions set out in that sub-section and which is located in Delhi. Then Section 158 deals with the disposal of property that is already distrained and also deals with the attachment and sale of immovable MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors 26.    Mr Dhond’s submission does not commend itself to us. Section 157 is an empowering provision. It only says that it is lawful for an MCD employee who is in receipt of a warrant to distrain any movable property or any standing timber growing crops or grass subject to certain conditions exceptions and exemptions. It is not possible we think, to read Section 157 as constraining the ambit, amplitude and operation of Section 156 which does not contain any such geographical limitation. Importantly, the Eighth Schedule referred to in Section 156 also does not provide for any such geographical restriction or limitation. 27.    Even otherwise, the submission cannot be accepted. For, if what Mr Dhond says is correct then the result is, inevitably, absurd and untenable. It means, one, that the MCD can never engage a contractor from outside Delhi or who has no property in Delhi, because then the MCD has no means of recovery. Two, that if the MCD does engage a contractor from outside Delhi, i.e., one who has no property in Delhi, then the MCD simply cannot proceed against that property in recovery. Three, that a contractor from outside Delhi who has no property in Delhi is more or less immunized from any recovery. Four, the DMC has no viable recourse against such a contractor. Five, that any attempt to recover against any property outside Delhi is unlawful. 28.    Therefore, the submission also involves injecting a non- existing word into Section 157(1): it means reading that section as: “It shall ONLY be lawful for any officer or other employees of the Corporation to whom a warrant issued under section MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors 29.     From any perspective, this is not a tenable manner to read the statute. The phrase “shall be lawful” has two purposes. First, it is clarificatory: it tells us what is permissible. Second, it introduces important safeguards for the debtor in Section 157(1)(a)(i) to (iv) and Section 157(1)(b). The domestic distraint, within Delhi, is limited to movable property and standing crops, etc., and even this “subject to the following conditions, exceptions and exemptions, namely …” And then follow the various provisions of sub-section (a)(i) to (a)(iv) 30.     Section 157(1) does not, therefore, control or limit Section 156 at all. 31.     The Toll Tax Bye-Laws are framed under the DMC Act. Bye- Law 2(1)(c) defines Toll Tax to be the tax imposed on commercial vehicles entering Delhi. Bye-Law 3 says the vehicles that are liable to pay toll tax and the tax rates. Bye-Law 6 sets out the method of collection of Toll Tax. Then there are provisions for penalty, closing transactions at the end of the day and crediting daily proceeds of the Toll Tax and so on. 32.     Next, we come to Section 455 of the DMC Act: “455. Mode of recovery of certain dues— In any case not expressly provided for in this Act or any bye-law made thereunder any due to the Corporation on account of any charge, costs, expenses, fees, rates or rent or on any other account under this Act or any such bye-law MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors may be recoverable from any person from whom such sum is due as an arrear of tax under this Act: Provided that no proceedings for the recovery of any sum under this section shall be commenced after the expiry of three years from the date on which such sum becomes due.” 33.    Clearly, Section 455 must be read with Section 156 and the Eighth Schedule. Therefore, it follows that an ‘arrear of tax’ can be recovered in the manner set out in Section 156— “by distress and sale of the movable property or the attachment and sale of the immovable property…” There is no geographical limitation in Section 455 or Section 156. 34.    Our attention is then invited to the provisions of the Revenue Recovery Act 1890. Section 3(1) says that where there are arrears of land revenue or a sum returnable as arrears of land revenue and the amount is held by the defaulter against property in a district other than that in which the arrears accrued or the sum is payable, the Collector may send to the other collector of the other district, a certificate stating the name of the defaulter and other particulars and the amount that is payable. This, in other words, is the revenue recovery certificate that led to the impugned notices. Section 3(3) says that receiving Collector shall (the word is not “may”)), on receiving the certificate, proceed to recover the amounts stated therein as if it were an arrears of land revenue which had accrued in his own District. MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors 35.    What this tells is that if an amount is recoverable as arrears of land revenue in one district, that recovery may be effected in another district by the issuance of a revenue recovery certificate. Mr Dhond argues that the toll tax claimed by the MCD is not an arrear of land revenue at all. It is, simply, a tax and it is recoverable as an arrear of tax under the Act. So says Section 455, he submits, and there is no way in which arrears of tax can be read to be arrears of land revenue. But this argument divorces Section 455 from Section 156 and the Eighth Schedule entirely; and that, as we have noticed, is untenable. 36.    Indeed, it is Mr Dhond’s submission that the MCD claim is not even a tax but it is simply a contractual debt alleged to be payable under a signed contract. What the MCD has therefore tried to do, Mr Dhond submits, is to elevate a contractual debt first to the level of a tax and then to the level of land revenue. Neither of these subsequent stages, he submits, is permissible in law. 37.     We do not think it is possible to accept this submission. We do not need to examine the contract or its termination or interpret the contractual provisions. MEPIDL was collecting and remitting toll. The question, therefore, is not whether MEPIDL was doing so under contract but what is it that it was collecting and remitting because it is this amount that is sought to be recovered. Toll is undoubtedly a tax. It is so defined. The statute so says. Even the Bye-laws make this abundantly clear. This completely answers the first aspect of the matter; and there is no question of limiting the recovery to a contractual debt. The second limb of the argument, MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors that it is only a tax and not land revenue and cannot be recovered as land revenue, to our mind unacceptably isolates Section 455 from Section 156 and the corresponding Eighth Schedule. Section 455 has two operative words. First, it speaks of a mode. Then it speaks of “certain dues”. Section 455 is a sort of residuary provision. It applies in any case not otherwise provided in the DMC Act or any Bye-law. The ambit of Section 455 is to cover any charge, cost, expenses, fees, rates, rent or any other account. Thus, even this goes against Mr Dhond because any claim would, under Section 455, be “a certain due” — including what Mr Dhond says is a mere contractual claim. This too can be recovered as an arrear of tax. That takes us directly to Section 156. Now that Section makes it abundantly clear that the tax due can be recovered under an Eighth Schedule warrant by distress and sale of movable property or the attachment and sale of immovable property of the defaulter. There is no geographical restriction in Section 156 limiting the action to assets in Delhi. 38.     This takes us to Mr Dhond’s submission that the Tehsildar was required to “satisfy himself” before issuing either of the impugned notices. We have understood this to mean that the Tehsildar ought to have embarked on some sort of quasi-judicial enquiry, perhaps even going into the question of statutory interpretation and reconciling these provisions. We do not believe this is correct at all. One reason is the Revenue Recovery Act. Once the Tehsildar or the Collector has received the Revenue Recovery Certificate, he necessarily had to act on it. Section 3(3) of the Revenue Recovery Act is unambiguous in that regard. There is no question of discretion in the hands of the Tehsildar. MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors 39.    Mr Joshi submits that toll is nothing but a form of land revenue. It is a tax for the use of land, i.e., for the use of a road by a vehicle. Land revenue is not defined in the Revenue Recovery Act. We do not think it is necessary to pronounce finally on this aspect of the matter in light of the view that we have taken that the action of the officer is correct in accordance with law. 40.    There is a final reason not to accept Mr Dhond’s submission. Cutting through all this jurisprudential argumentation, one thing appears to us to be perfectly plain. Now that it has failed to get any protection from the Delhi High Court, MEPIDL has set about trying to stymie all recovery proceedings by assailing a ministerial order and thus reducing even the proceedings in the Delhi High Court to an idle formality. We are having none of it. At the very least, the comity of Courts requires us to defer to the Delhi High Court in this regard. It is not shown to us unequivocally that the Tehsildar has acted illegally, unlawfully or in any manner that warrants the exercise of our discretion in issuing a high prerogative remedy. Merely because it is uncomfortable for MEPIDL is not a ground to interfere. If this is a purely contractual dispute, as Mr Dhond himself suggests it is, then MEPIDL’s remedies lie elsewhere and not in our Writ Court. 41.    Reliance is sought to be placed on the decision of a learned Single Judge, Badar Durrez Ahmad J as he then was, of the Delhi High Court in Callipers Naigai Ltd & Ors v Government of NCT of Delhi & Ors1 on the question of territoriality and jurisdiction. While MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors we agree with the decision and judgment of the learned Single Judge, we believe that the present case stands on a slightly different footing. The point here is not whether this Court has jurisdiction, especially territorial jurisdiction under Article 226(2) of the Constitution of India, but whether that jurisdiction is required to be exercised on the facts and in the circumstances of this case. As we have noted, almost everything in this case militates against the exercise of jurisdiction in favour of MEPIDL. 42.    Mr Joshi relies on the recent three-Judge bench decision of the Supreme Court in Jalkal Vibhag Nagar Nigam & Ors v Pradeshiya Industrial and Investment Corporation.2This discussed inter alia the nature of levy under Section 52 of the UP Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1975. There was a dispute as to whether the levy was a tax on land and buildings. The Supreme Court inter alia observed that there has been a gradual obliteration of the distinction between a tax and a fee at a conceptual level. It approved the earlier authorities that there is no generic difference between a tax and a fee, and held that the practical and constitutional distinction between the two has eroded. A fee may also be a compulsory exaction. It may also carry an element of compulsion. The point that Mr Joshi makes is that it is not the label that one attaches to it but it is the nature of the levy that is of relevance. Jalkal Vibhag was distinguished in Kerala State Beverages Manufacturing & Marketing Corporation Ltd v Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax.3 The Revenue seems to have argued in Kerala State Beverages that, following Jalkal Vibhag, there is no distinction at all, MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors ever, between a fee and a tax. This argument was repelled. The Supreme Court in Kerala State Beverages held that it is a settled principle of interpretation that where the same statute uses different terms and expressions, the legislature is referring to different things. It also held that Jalkal Vibhag maintains and does not take away the basic constitutional distinction between a ‘fee’ and a ‘tax’. Mr Joshi’s point is that the statute defines toll as a tax. Merely because it is collected under a contract will not change the nature of the levy, or make it something other than a tax. MEPIDL was, plain and simple, MCD’s tax collector. The amount in MEPIDL’s hands was tax — by statute. It remained a tax, and this tax had to be remitted to the MCD. It could not become ‘consideration’ or ‘damages’ or a contractual debt of any other kind. This was always tax due to the MCD. It was due from the drivers/owners of commercial vehicles entering Delhi, and it was payable to the MCD. MEPIDL was only ‘harvesting’ the tax collections. It was a tax, and remains a tax, says Mr Joshi; and Section 455 and 156 of the DMC Act show how this can be recovered — i.e., against movable and immovable property even outside Delhi. We believe this submission is perfectly correctly 43.     We see no reason, finally, to exercise our discretion at all in regard to the several distress warrants that had been issued. It is undoubtedly plain that MEPIDL had in fact challenged one such distress warrant in Delhi. There may be a controversy about whether it is withdrawn or not withdrawn but we do not see how MEPIDL can literally take its chances in one High Court and then try again in another High Court in this manner. The entire trajectory of this is to be deprecated. When a principle challenge MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors against the termination fails and while an appeal is pending, one distress warrant is challenged in Delhi only to be allegedly later withdrawn and other distress warrants are now brought before this 44.    These are reasons for us to refuse to exercise our Article 226 discretion which is after all undoubtedly equitable. Granting relief to MEPIDL would, we believe, be entirely inequitable in the facts and circumstances of the case. 45.    To put it a little colloquially and to put a lid on it, we made it clear to Mr Dhond that in any such matter involving a matter of commerce or even high commerce, it is now our almost invariable practice to first ask that the amount be deposited. Mr Dhond is clear that he is unable to do anything of the kind. If that be so, then to his request that we grant him a writ, we must answer in the same coin, that we too are unable to do anything of the kind. 46.    The MEPIDL Petition is dismissed. 47.    As to the MCD Petition, the challenge here is to a notice issued by the Kalyan Janata Sahakari Bank on 4th January 2022 to MEPIDL asking it to show cause why the account should not be frozen. The action of the Bank is indefensible. The bank has no authority in law to invite suggestions and objections from a defaulter against whom there is a Revenue Recovery Certificate. Once the Tahsildar has issued a notice to freeze the account, the bank must MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd & Anr v South Delhi Municipal Corporation & Ors comply, and it is then for the defaulter to apply to a Court or an authority to have that account released from freezing. 48.    Accordingly, in the MCD Petition we issue Rule, make it returnable forthwith and make Rule absolute in terms of prayer clauses (a) and (b). Prayer (c) is of course not seriously pressed by 49.    The Petitions are disposed of in these terms. Mr Joshi presses for costs. We believe that he has quite enough to recover. There will be no order as to costs. 50.    The Interim Applications are infructuous and are disposed of 51.    Mr Dhond seeks an extension of an earlier protection. To grant that would be to undermine everything we have just said. The application is refused.
1.     This appeal has been preferred by the claimants-appellants against the judgment and award dated 24.08.2021 passed by learned (hereinafter referred to as ‘Tribunal’) in M.A.C.P. No. 116 of 2018 (Roop Lal and Another Vs. Suresh Kumar Yadav and others), whereby the learned Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.1,80,000/- as compensation to the claimants with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum. 2.     The claimants-appellants have preferred this appeal for enhancement of quantum. 3.     The brief facts of the case are that a claim petition was filed before the learned Tribunal by the claimants-appellants with the averments that on 18.03.2018 claimant-appellant no.1, Roop Lal was walking with his son on Kakvan Road within the jurisdiction of police station Bilhaur Districct Kanpur Nagar. At that time, a truck bearing no. U.P.93 BT 4990 who was being driven very rashly and negligently by its driver, hit the son of the appellant no.1 from behind due to which he fell on the road and front wheel of the truck ran over him. Appellant no.1’s son sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. The deceased was a child of aged about 7 years. 4.     The respondents filed their respective written statements. after considering the evidence on record, awarded Rs.1,80,000/- to the appellants-claimants who are deceased’s father and mother respectively. 5.     Aggrieved mainly with the compensation awarded, the appellants preferred this appeal. 6.     Heard Mr. Mohd. Naushad Siddiqui, learned counsel for the appellants, Mr. Vipul Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent no.3 and Mr. Shreesh Srivastava, learned counsel for the respondent nos.1 & 2. Perused the record. 7.     The accident is not in dispute. The issue of negligence has been decided in favour of the appellants herein. The Insurance Company has not challenged the liability imposed on it by the Tribunal. The only issued to be decided is the quantum of compensation. 8.     This is a claimants appeal, claiming enhancement of award for the death of a child who was 07 years of age at the time of his death. Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that deceased was a brilliant student and he had very bright future. This aspect is not considered by the Tribunal. It is also submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that the notional income of the deceased is taken Rs.15,000/- per annum by the Tribunal. It is next submitted that learned Tribunal has held that the contribution of the deceased towards his family was only assumed as 1/2 of his income and in this way the Tribunal has awarded only 1/2 of his income as compensation, which is not just and proper. 9.     Per contra, learned counsel for the Insurance Company has submitted that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper and the judgment and award passed by Tribunal also does not suffer from any such infirmity or illegality which may call for any this court. 10.    The learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the award is bad and relied on decision of this Court and Apex Court in Kishan Gopal and another v. Lala and others, 2013 (101) ALR 281 (SC) = 2013 (131) AIC 219 = 2014 (1) AICC 208 (SC) and Manju Devi's case, 2005 (1) TAC 609 = 2005 AICC 208 (SC) relied by this Court in its recent decision of this Court in United India Insurance Company Limited. Vs. Mumtaz Ahmad and Another, 2017 (2) AICC "6. Sri Ram Singh has heavily relied on the decision in the case of Kishan Gopal and another v. Lala and others, 2013 (101) ALR 281 (SC) = 2013 (131) AIC 219 = 2014 (1) AICC 208 (SC) and Manju Devi's case, 2005 (1) TAC 609 = 2005 AICC 208 (SC). It goes without saying the notional figure fixed by the Apex Court since Manju Devi's judgment has been consistently Rs.2,25,000 for children below the age of 15 years. I think that is just and proper and hence, the amount requires to be enhanced from Rs.1,57,000 to Rs.2,25,000 with 6% be recovered from the owner. The appeal is partly allowed. The cross-objection is also partly allowed." 11.    The judgment of Kisan Gopal (Supra) cannot be made applicable to the facts of this case as in this case the apex court did not deduct any amount towards personal expenses. 12.    Recently, the Hon’ble Apex Court has decided the controversy ans settled the law regarding the death of a child in Kurvan Ansari @ Kurvan Ali and another Vs. Shyam Kishore Murmu and another, 2021 (4) TAC 673 (Supreme Court). In this case, the Hon’ble Apex Court has stated that in spite of repeated directions, Scheduled-II of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is not yet amended. Therefore, fixing notional income of Rs.15,000/- per annum for non earning members is not just and reasonable. It is further stated by the Apex Court that in view of the judgments in the cases of Puttamma and others Vs. K.L. Narayana Reddy and another, 2014 (1) TAC 926 and Kishan Gopal and another v. Lala and others, 2013 (4) TAC 5. It is a fit case to increase the notional income by taking into account the inflation, devaluation of the rupees and cost of living. 13.      With the aforesaid observations, the Hon’ble Apex Court took the notional income of the deceased at Rs.25,000/- per annum, hence we are of the considered view that notional income of the deceased must be assumed Rs.25,000/- per annum as he was non-earning member. Accordingly, when the notional income is multiplied with applicable multiplier ‘15’ as prescribed in Scheduled-II for the claims under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it comes to Rs.3,75,000/- towards loss of dependency. The appellant nos.1 & 2 are also entitled to a sum of Rs.40,000/- each towards filial consortium and Rs.15,000/- funeral expense. Hence, the appellant nos.1 and 2 are entitled to the following amount towards (i) Loss of Dependency : 25,000/- X 15 = Rs.3,75,000/- (ii) Filial consortium : 40,000/- X 2 = Rs.80,000/- 14.      We hold that in view of the latest decision of the Apex Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Mannat Johal and Others, 2019 (2) T.A.C. 705 (S.C.), the appellant nos.1 and 2 shall be entitled to the rate of interest as 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim 15.      In view of the above, the appeal is partly allowed. Judgment and award passed by the Tribunal shall stand modified to the aforesaid extent. The respondent-Insurance   Company shall deposit the amount within a period of 08 weeks from today with interest at the rate of 7.5% from the date of filing of the claim petition till the amount is deposited. The amount already deposited be deducted from the amount to be deposited.
2.      Aggrieved by an order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad for the State of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh allowing the revision petition filed by the tenant under Section 22 of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960 (in short “the Act”) and the setting aside an order of eviction passed by the Rent Control Appellate Authority, the landlord is before us in the above Appeal. 3.      We have heard learned counsel on both sides. 4.      The appellant-landlord sought eviction of the respondent-tenant on two grounds namely: (1) wilful default in payment of rent; (2) bona fide requirement of the premises for the own use of the landlord. 5.      The Rent Controller dismissed the eviction petition, but the Rent Control Appellate Authority allowed the appeal filed by the landlord and ordered eviction. In a revision filed by the tenant under Section 22 of the Act, the High Court has set aside the order of eviction passed by the Appellate Authority, forcing the landlord to come up with the above Appeal. 6.      Insofar as the first ground on which the eviction was sought is concerned, there was a dispute as to what the agreed monthly rent was. While the appellant-landlord claimed that the agreed monthly rent was Rs.3,200/-, the respondent-tenant claimed that the agreed rent was Rs.1,600/- per month. 7.      The appellant who purchased the property from the previous owner in September 2013, relied upon a letter of Attornment of Tenancy issued by the erstwhile landlord, indicating the monthly rent to be Rs.3,200/. Unfortunately, the High Court held that this letter of Attornment of Tenancy was not sufficient to prove the monthly rent to be Rs.3,200/-. The High Court felt that the previous landowner ought to have been examined by the appellant in this regard. 8.      But we do not agree. The proceedings before the Rent Controller are summary in nature. The purchase of the building by the appellant in September 2013 is not disputed. Therefore, the appellant was entitled to rely upon the letter of Attornment of Tenancy. In fact the letter of Attornment of Tenancy is addressed to the respondent-tenant with a copy marked to the appellant. Therefore, the High Court was wrong in reversing the finding given by the Appellate Authority in this regard. 9.      Insofar as the second ground is concerned, the Appellate Authority found that the appellant was carrying on business and that he had children for whom he wanted to set- up a business. On the ground that the eldest son of the appellant was still pursuing studies, the High Court held that the requirement of the appellant was not bona fide. 10.     Again we do not agree with the aforesaid finding. There is no bar for someone who is pursuing higher studies, to start a business. The High Court, for a moment did not realize that it was dealing with a revision, where its jurisdiction was limited. 11.     Therefore, we are of the view that the order of the High Court is unsustainable and liable to be set aside. Accordingly, the above appeal is allowed, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the order of the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority is restored. The tenant is given six months’ time from today to vacate the property and handover the vacant possession.
1.      Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 14.08.2018 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in FAO(OS) No.112 of 2018 by which the High Court has partly allowed the said appeal, the Indian Railway Construction Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as “IRCON”) has preferred the present appeal. 2.      The brief facts leading to filing of the present appeal in nut-shell are as under: 2.1     That, an Agreement was entered into between IRCON and the respondent – M/s. National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited ( hereinafter referred to as “NBCC”), whereby the respondent was awarded the work of construction of Railway Station cum Commercial Complex at Vashi, Navi Mumbai at a cost of Rs.3042.91 lakh, to be constructed within a period of 30 months from 05.04.1990. NBCC failed to complete the work in time. Thereafter, the supplementary agreements were entered into between the parties. As the provision for grant of advances had exhausted, NBCC approached IRCON with modified programme for completion of works and sought for additional financial aid on certain terms and conditions. IRCON in consultation with CIDCO, agreed to grant advance as a special case against Bank Guarantee. Accordingly, a supplementary Agreement dated 17.12.1991 was entered into between the parties providing for special advance of an amount of Rs. 68 lakhs bearing interest at the rate of 18% per annum on furnishing of Bank Guarantee. In terms of the supplementary Agreement dated 17.12.1991, a special advance of Rs.68 lakhs was also given to NBCC. As there was delay in the work of NBCC and the work was practically abandoned and came to a standstill, IRCON served on NBCC a notice dated 21.02.1994 terminating the contract relying upon Clause 60.1 of the Agreement. 2.2    That, thereafter, after some litigation before the Delhi High Court, the NBCC invoked the arbitration clause. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted. The Arbitral Tribunal passed the award dated 04.11.2011. That the Arbitral Tribunal rejected the NBCC’s claim for refund of two security deposits i.e. Claim Nos.33 and 34. While holding so, the Arbitral Tribunal held that though termination with reference to Clause 60.1 was bad in law, but justified the termination with reference to Clause 17.4 of the Contract and consequently rejected the NBCC’s claim for refund of two security deposits i.e. claim Nos.33 and 34. The Arbitral Tribunal also partly allowed Counter Claim No.3 in favour of IRCON. Counter Claim No.3 was relatable to the counter claim of IRCON for a total of Rs.3,65,38,806/towards interest on various advances given to NBCC, more particularly, with regard to two specific advances being (1) Special Advance and (2) Advance against hypothecation of equipment. 2.3    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal and insofar as relating to Claim Nos.33 and 34 and the Counter Claim No.3 which were in favor of IRCON, the NBCC approached the High Court by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as “Arbitration Act”). The application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was confined to the aforesaid three claims / counter claims respectively viz. Claim Nos.33 and 34 and Counter Claim No.3 only. 2.4    By the judgment and order dated 03.03.2017, the learned Single Judge of the High Court set aside the rejection by the learned Arbitral Tribunal of Claim Nos.33 and 34 of NBCC to the extent it concerned the return of security deposit amounts i.e. Rs.5,57,486/- + Rs.60,85,840/- by observing and concluding that once the Arbitral Tribunal found that the termination with regard to Clause 60.1 was not justified, it was not open for the Arbitral Tribunal thereafter to consider the termination under Clause 17.4 justifying forfeiture of the security deposits. The learned Single Judge of the High Court also set aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on Counter Claim No.3 by observing that there is no clause in the contract in particular awarding 18% interest per annum on special advance. 2.5    The judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge was the subject matter of appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act before the Division Bench of 2.6    By the impugned judgment and order, the Division Bench of the High Court has partly allowed the said appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act to the extent upholding the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal insofar as awarding the interest on special advance is concerned. The rest of the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge has been affirmed / confirmed by the Division Bench of 2.7    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, IRCON has preferred the present 3.     Shri R.S. Hegde, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of the appellant – IRCON and Shri Arvind Minocha, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent – NBCC. 4.     Shri R.S. Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently submitted that on appreciation of entire evidence and the material on record as the learned Tribunal has observed and held that the IRCON was justified in rescinding the contract due to abandonment of work by NBCC and when the said finding attained the finality, the IRCON was justified in forfeiting the security deposits. It is submitted that as such the High Court has taken too technical view. It is submitted that as such both, Clause 17.4 and Clause 60.1 are required to be read together. It is submitted that the main aspect which is required to be considered is whether the NBCC failed to complete the work as per the contract and whether the NBCC abandoned the work and thereafter, having satisfied that even during the extended period, the NBCC was not able to complete the work, the contract was rightly rescinded and therefore, the security deposits were liable to be forfeited. 4.1     It is submitted that therefore both, the learned Single Judge (in application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act) and the Division Bench of the High Court have materially erred in upsetting / quashing and setting aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting the Claim Nos.33 and 34. 4.2     It is submitted that both, the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court have materially erred in not appreciating the fact that once the termination is justifiable with reference to the terms of the contract and even if a wrong clause is mentioned in the letter terminating the contract, the power to terminate the contract cannot be said to be illegal, more particularly, when the power is traceable to the specific terms of the contract, i.e., Clause 17.4. 4.3     Now, so far as the Counter Claim No.3 is concerned, it is submitted that as such the Division Bench of the High Court has set aside the award of interest on the amount advanced against hypothecation of equipments, on the ground that there is no such provision of award of interest in the contract / supplementary Agreements. It is submitted that however, the Division Bench of the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that there is no bar to award interest on the amount advanced. It is submitted that the Arbitrator has power to award interest pendente lite unless specifically barred from awarding it. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Raveechee and Company Vs. Union of India reported in (2018) 7 SCC Making above submissions, it is prayed to allow the present appeal and restore the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal. 5.      Learned senior counsel, Mr. Minocha appearing on behalf of the respondent – NBCC while supporting the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court has vehemently submitted that in the present case admittedly the IRCON invoked Clause 60.1 and rescinded the contract. It is submitted that even the learned Arbitral Tribunal also observed and held that the IRCON was not justified in rescinding the contract under Clause 60.1. It is submitted that however, thereafter the Arbitral Tribunal justified the termination of the contract under Clause 17.4 , which as rightly held by the learned Single Judge / Division Bench was not permissible. 5.1     It is submitted that the finding recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal that the contract could not have been rescinded under Clause 60.1 had attained the finality. It is submitted that therefore the learned Arbitral Tribunal was not justified in rejecting the claim Nos.33 and 34 which has rightly been set aside by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench, which are not required to be interfered with by this Court in exercise of limited jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. 5.2     It is further submitted by learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent – NBCC that in absence of any specific provision in the contract / supplementary Agreements on interest on the amount advanced against hypothecation of equipments, the Division Bench of the High Court has rightly set aside the same. Making above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. 6.      We have heard learned Counsel appearing for the respective parties at length. 7.      As observed hereinabove, challenge to the award by the learned Arbitral Tribunal before the learned Single Judge and now before this Court is with respect to Claim Nos.33 and 34 and Counter Claim No.3 (Partly). 7.1     The learned Arbitral Tribunal rejected the Claim Nos.33 and 34 which were with respect to forfeiture of the security deposits on termination / rescind of the contract. The Counter Claim No.3 of the IRCON was for a total sum of Rs.3,65,38,806/- towards interest on various advances given to NBCC, more particularly, with regard to two specific advances being (1) Special Advance and (2) Advance against hypothecation of equipment. The learned Arbitral Tribunal allowed the Counter Claim No.3 and awarded interest at the rate of 18% per annum in favour of the IRCON being interest on special advance and advances against hypothecation of equipments. The Division Bench of the High Court has partly allowed the appeal and allowed the interest in favour of IRCON at the rate of 18% so far as special advance is concerned. 7.2     While considering the findings recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal and while appreciating the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties, relevant clauses of the Agreement, more particularly, Clause Nos.17.4, 59.1, 60.1 are required to be referred to, which are as under: 17.4 The time for completion of the works by the date or extended date fixed for completion shall be deemed to be the essence of the contract and if the contractor shall fail to complete the works within the time prescribe the Company IRCON shall, if satisfied that the works can be completed by the contractor within a reasonably short time thereafter be entitled without prejudice to any other right or remedy available on that behalf to recover by way of ascertained liquidated damages a sum equivalent to one per cent of the contract value of the works for each week or part of week the contractor is in default and allow the contractor such further extension of time as the Project Manager may decide. If the Company (IRCON) is not satisfied that the works can be completed by the contractor and in the event of failure on the part of the contractor to complete the works within the further extension of time allowed as aforesaid the Company (IRCON) shall be entitled, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available in that behalf, to appropriate the contractor’s security deposit and rescind the contract, whether or not actual damage is caused by such default. 59.1 The Company (IRCON) shall be entitled to determine and terminate the contract at any time should in the Company’s (IRCON) opinion, the cessation of work become necessary owing to paucity of funds or from any cause whatsoever, in which case the value of approved materials at site and of work done to date by the contractor will be paid for in full at the rates specified in the contract. Notice in writing from the Company (IRCON) of such determination and the reason therefore shall be conclusive evidence thereof. ii.     make an arrangement with or assignment in favour of his creditors, or agree to carry out the contract under committee of Inspection of his creditors, or iii.    Being a company or corporation, go into liquidation (other than a voluntary liquidation for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction), or iv.     have an execution levied on his good or property on the works, or v.      assign the contract or any part thereof otherwise than as provided in Clause 7 of these conditions, or vi. abandon the contract, or vii.    persistently disregard the instructions of the Project Manager, or contravene any viii.   fail to adhere to the agreed programme of work by a margin of 10% of the stipulated ix.     fail to remove materials from the site or to pull down and replace work after receiving from the Project Manager notice to the effect that the said materials or works have been condemned or rejected under conditions, or x.      fail to take steps to employ competent or additional staff and labour as required under xi.     fail to afford the Project Manager or Project Manager’s representative proper facilities for inspecting the works or any part thereof as required under these conditions, or xii.    promise, offer or give any bribe, commission, gift or advantages either himself or through his partner, agent or servant to any officer of employee of IRCON or to any person on his or on the behalf in relation to the execution of this or any other contract with IRCON. Then and in any of the said cases, the Project Manager on behalf of the Company (IRCON) may serve the contractor with a notice in writing to that effect and if the contractor does not within 7 days after the delivery to him of such notice proceed to make good his default in so far as the same is capable of being made and carry on the work or comply with such directions as aforesaid to the entire satisfaction of the Project Manager the Company (IRCON) shall be entitled after giving 48 hours notice in writing under the hand of the Project Manager (to remove the contractor from the whole or any portion or portions as may be specified in such notice) of the works without thereby avoiding the contract or releasing the contractor from any of his obligations or liabilities under the contract and adopt any or several of the following a)      to rescind the contract, of which rescission notice in writing to the contractor under the hand of the Project Manager shall be conclusive evidence, in which case the security deposit of the contractor shall stand forfeited to the Company IRCON without prejudice to the Company’s (IRCON) right to recover from the contractor any amount by which the cost of competing the works by any other agency shall exceed the value of the contractor. b)      to carry out the works or any part thereof, by the employment of the required labour and materials, the costs of which shall include lead, lift, freight, supervision and all incidental charges and to debit the contractor with such costs, the amount of which as certified by the Project Manager shall be final and binding upon the contractor, and to credit the contractor with the value of the works done as if the works had been carried out by the contractor under the terms of the contract. And the certificate of Project Manager in respect of the amount to be credited to the contractor shall be final and binding upon the contractor; c)      to measure up the work executed by the contractor and to get the remaining work completed by another contractor at the risk and expense of the contractor in all respects in which case any expenses that may be incurred in excess of the sum which would have been paid to the contractor if the works had been carried out by him under the terms of the contract, the amount of which excess as certified by the Project Manager shall be final and binding upon contractor shall be borne and paid by the contractor and may be deducted from any moneys due to him by the Company (IRCON) under the contractor or otherwise or from his security deposit. Provided always that in any case in which any of the powers conferred upon the Company ( IRCON ) hereof shall have become exercisable and the same shall not be exercised, the nonexercise thereof shall not constitute a waiver of any of the conditions hereof and such powers shall notwithstanding be exercisable in the event of any future case of default by the contractor for which his liability for past and future shall remain unaffected.” Considering the material on record and on appreciation of evidence, the learned Arbitral Tribunal though observed that the IRCON was not justified in rescinding the contract under Clause 60.1, rescinding of the contract / termination of the contract was justified under Clause 17.4, and thereby has rejected the Claim Nos.33 and 34 of the NBCC which were with respect to forfeiture of the security deposits. The learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court have set aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34 inter alia on the ground that once the Arbitral Tribunal gave the finding that the IRCON was not justified in invoking Clause 60.1, thereafter it was not open for the Arbitral Tribunal to take the help of Clause 17.4 and therefore, the learned Arbitral Tribunal was not justified in rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34 which were with respect to forfeiture of security deposits, which could have been under Clause 17.4. However, it is required to be noted that as such the finding recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal on applicability of Clause 17.4 and/or rescinding of the contract under Clause 17.4 has not been set aside either by the learned Single Judge or by the Division Bench of the High Court and therefore, the findings recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on applicability of Clause 17.4 has attained the finality. The learned Arbitral Tribunal as such was absolutely justified in considering whether IRCON was justified in rescinding the contract, may be either under Clause 60.1 or under Clause 17.4. Even otherwise, from the material on record and even the notice dated 21.02.1994 and the subsequent notice dated 07.03.1994, we are satisfied that the IRCON was satisfied that the work could not be completed by the contractor even within further extension of time. Clause 17.4 provides that if the company (IRCON) is not satisfied that the works can be completed by the contractor and in the event of failure on the part of the contractor to complete the works within further extension of time allowed, the IRCON shall be entitled, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available in that behalf, to appropriate the contractor’s security deposits and rescind the contract, whether or not actual damage is caused by such default. Even Clause 60.1 also provides for determination of contract owing to default of contractor. It provides that if the contractor should abandon the contract, or persistently disregard the instructions of the Project Manager or contravene any provisions of the contract…. then the Project Manager on behalf of the Company may serve the contractor with a notice in writing to that effect and if the contractor does not within 7 days after the delivery to him of such notice proceed to make good his default in so far as the same is capable of being made good and carry on the work or comply with such directions as aforesaid to the entire satisfaction of the Project Manager, the Company (IRCON) shall be entitled after giving 48 hours notice in writing under the hand of the Project Manager (to remove the contractor from the whole or any portion or portions as may be specified in such notice) of the works without thereby avoiding the contract or releasing the contractor from any of his obligations or liabilities. It further provides that in such a case the Project Manager on behalf of the IRCON shall be entitled to rescind the contract, in which case the security deposit shall stand forfeited to IRCON without prejudice to IRCON’s right to recover from the contractor any amount by which the cost of completing the works by any other agency shall exceed the value of the 7.3 Thus, both, under Clause 17.4 and 60.1, on failure of the contractor to complete the work, the IRCON is justified in rescinding the contract and forfeit the security deposit. At the cost of repetition it is observed that the learned Arbitral Tribunal on appreciation of entire evidence on record, had specifically observed that the contractor failed to complete the work even within the stipulated extended period of time and even abandoned the work and therefore, the IRCON was justified in rescinding the contract. The said finding as observed hereinabove has attained finality. Therefore, the IRCON was absolutely justified in forfeiting the security deposits and therefore, the learned Arbitral Tribunal was absolutely justified in rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34, which were with respect to forfeiture of security deposits by the IRCON. Both, the learned Single Judge as well as Division Bench of the High Court have seriously erred in setting aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34. We are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge, therefore, exceeded in its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act quashing and setting aside the well-reasoned award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34, which the Division Bench of the High Court has wrongly 7.4 Under the circumstances, the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court quashing and setting aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34 deserve to be quashed and set aside and the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34 is required to be restored and upheld. 7.5 Now, so far as the quashing and setting aside the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal awarding interest @ 18% on advance for the hypothecation of equipment, by the learned Single Judge confirmed by the Division Bench is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that the Division Bench of the High Court has upheld the order passed by the learned Single Judge quashing and setting aside the interest awarded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on advance for the hypothecation of equipment on the ground that there is no such stipulation in the agreement / contract. However, the High Court has not at all considered Section 31(7)(a) of the Arbitration Act, which permits the arbitrator that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in so far as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the Arbitral Tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made. Thus, unless there is a specific bar under the contract, it is always open for the arbitrator / Arbitral Tribunal to award pendente lite interest. Identical question came to be considered by this Court in the case of Raveechee and Company (supra). In the said decision, it is observed and held by this Court that an arbitrator has the power to award interest unless specifically barred from awarding it and the bar must be clear and specific. In the said decision, it is observed and held that the liability to pay interest pendente lite arises because the claimant has been found entitled to the same and had been kept out from those dues due to the pendency of the arbitration, i.e., pendente lite. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision to the facts of the case on hand, once it was found that the advance amount was paid for hypothecation of equipment and thereafter when the Arbitral Tribunal awarded the interest on advance for hypothecation of equipment, the same was not required to be interfered with by the learned Single Judge in exercise of the powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and even by the Division Bench of the High Court while exercising the powers under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. However, at the same time to award the interest @ 18% can be said to be on a higher side. In the facts and circumstances of the case, if the interest is awarded @ 12% on advance for the hypothecation of equipment, the same can be said to be reasonable interest. 8.      In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, present appeal succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court quashing and setting aside the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claim Nos. 33 and 34 are hereby quashed and set aside and the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal rejecting the claim Nos. 33 and 34 is hereby restored. The impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court in confirming the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge insofar as quashing and setting aside the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal awarding the interest @ 18% on the advance for hypothecation of equipment is concerned, the same is hereby quashed and set aside and the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal awarding the interest on advance for hypothecation of equipment is hereby restored, however, with a modification that there shall be paid an interest @ 12 % pendente lite on advance for hypothecation of equipment instead of 18% as awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal. Present appeal is accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
1.     The Revision Petitioner being aggrieved by the Judgment dated 13.11.2013 passed by the II Addl. Dist. & Sessions Judge, Chikkamagalur in Crl. A. No.152/2013 dismissing her appeal against the Judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Prl. Civil Judge & JMFC, Kadur, in C.C. No.401/2008 dated 05.03.2013 has preferred this Revision Petition. 2.     The parties to this Revision Petition are referred to as per their rank before the Trial Court, for convenience. 3.     The brief facts leading up to this revision petition are as That The complainant and accused are known to each other.   It is alleged that, accused approached the complainant for financial assistance for her family necessities and benefits. Accordingly, complainant advanced a loan of Rs.1,00,000/- in the first week of October, 2007 to the accused. In discharge of the said legal liability, it is alleged that, accused issued a cheque bearing No.0775854 dated 30.10.2007 for Rs.1,00,000/- drawn on Chikmagalur-Kodagu Grameena Bank, Kadur.               It is further alleged   that,   when     the    said  cheque    was   presented   for encashment through the banker of the complainant i.e., Canara Bank on 21.01.2008, the said cheque came to be dishonoured as per the endorsement dated 29.01.2008 as "funds insufficient". The complainant has intimated the same to the accused on 03.02.2008. Thereafter, she got issued the legal notice to the accused on 08.02.2008 demanding the repayment of the cheque amount. But accused failed to pay the demanded amount. Thereafter, the complainant filed a complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C. before the Trial Court alleging offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the accused. 4.     On filing the complaint, the learned Trial Court took cognizance of the offence, recorded sworn statement of the complainant, issued process against accused and secured her presence. She was enlarged on bail.    The Trial Court recorded the substance of accusation, accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 5.     To substantiate the case of the complainant, she herself examined as P.W.1 and marked documents on her behalf as Exs.P1 to P6. After closure of the evidence of the complainant, accused was questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C. so as enable her to answer the incriminating circumstances appearing in the evidence of the prosecution.   She denied her complicity in the crime. She submitted before the Trial Court that, she wants to lead defence evidence. Accordingly, by way of defence evidence, she entered witness box as D.W.1. She also examined one more person as D.W.2 on her behalf and marked documents at Exs.D1 to D10 and closed her evidence. 6.     The learned Trial Court after hearing arguments of both sides,   passed  the  impugned    Judgment   of  conviction and sentence for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and directed the accused to pay a fine of Rs.2,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine, she shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of four months. It is further ordered that, out of the fine amount, a sum of Rs.1,95,000/- be paid to the complainant as compensation amount. Being aggrieved by the said Judgment of conviction and sentence, accused preferred Crl.A. No.152/2013 before the II Addl. Dist. and Sessions Judge, Chikmagalur, being the First Appellate Court. 7.    The learned First Appellate Court, after hearing both sides, dismissed   the   said appeal   on   13.11.2013   confirming   the Judgment of conviction and sentence passed by Principal JMFC, Kadur in C.C. No. 104/2008, dated 05.03.2013.        This is how, being aggrieved by the concurrent findings of the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court, the revision petitioner being accused has preferred this revision petition on the following 8.    That the Trial Court and First Appellate Court have passed the Judgment which is against the law and facts. Therefore, the said Judgments are liable to be set aside.      It is further stated that, the First Appellate Court in the absence of a cogent evidence, erred in holding that the Revision Petitioner - accused has received cheque i.e., Ex.P1 for a consideration from the complainant which is erroneous. The complainant has not placed any material before the Trial Court to show that, she has paid Rs.1,00,000/- to the accused -Revision Petitioner. Even then, the Trial Court and First Appellate Court have believed the testimony of P.W.1 and convicted the Revision Petitioner - accused. Though it is stated by the Revision Petitioner alleging that, the income she derives is sufficient for her livelihood and she is not having any amount, even then, the Trial Court has convicted the accused - Revision Petitioner.    It is very much clear from the evidence of complainant - respondent that she had no capacity to pay such huge amount of Rs.1,00,000/- to the Revision 9.     It is further stated that, Ex.P1 has been issued to one Jayamma.       Admittedly, name of respondent is Nagamma. Though the respondent says that she is called as Jayamma, but no document is produced to substantiate the same.                The Revision Petitioner has produced documents to show that, her name is Nagamma. It is further stated that, the respondent is not the holder of Ex.P1 cheque.          As such, the provisions of Section 139 of the N.I. Act cannot be extended so to benefit the respondent i.e. the complainant. The findings of the Trial Court and First Appellate Court are not proper and such findings are without proper appreciation of the evidence so led by the accused. Even there is an admission by P.W.1 that, there are no financial transactions between complainant and accused. This itself is sufficient to dismiss the complaint. Amongst other grounds, it is prayed to set aside the impugned Judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court, affirmed by 10.    After filing this Revision Petition, notice came to be issued and respondent appeared before the Court through her counsel. The Trial Court records are secured. 11.    Heard the arguments of learned counsel for both sides. Meticulously perused the records. 12.    Before adverting to other aspects of the case, let me analyse certain factual features that emerge from the facts of this case. 13.    It is the allegation of the complainant that this revision petitioner being accused, issued a cheque for Rs.1,00,000/-, bearing No.0775854 dated 30.10.2007 drawn on Chikmagalur- Kodagu Grameena Bank, Kadur, in discharge of a legal debt for having received the amount from the complainant to meet her financial necessities. The said cheque was presented by the complainant     on   21.01.2008    before  the  banker   of   the complainant i.e. Canara Bank. The said cheque was returned with an endorsement "funds insufficient" on 29.01.2008.       On 03.02.2008, an intimation was issued by the complainant to the accused that cheque issued by the accused was dishonoured. Thereafter, within the statutory period, she issued a demand notice on 08.02.2008. The said notice was not served and the accused managed to return the same. The said notice was also sent through Certificate of Posting. Thereafter, accused did not pay the amount. Then the complainant filed a private complaint under Section 200 Cr.P.C. against the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The said complaint was registered after recording sworn statement. Trial was conducted against the accused. The learned Trial Court passed the Judgment of conviction and sentence as stated supra. Being aggrieved, the accused preferred Crl.A. No.152/2013 before the II Addl. Dist. and Sessions Judge, Chikmagalur. The said appeal came to be dismissed on 13.11.2008. These are the calendar of events that have taken place in this case. 14.   Law with regard to offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is very much laid down. Before appreciation of the position of law, and facts of this case, one must read the provisions of Sections 138 and 139 of the N.I. Act. They read as under: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds [Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two years, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both: Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply (a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier; (b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice; in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice. Explanation.-- For the purposes of this section, debt of other liability means a legally enforceable debt or other liability. Section 139.     Presumption in favour of holder: It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability." 15.    Thus, after reading the settled line of precedents so to say, a meaningful reading of the provisions of the N.I. Act including in particular, Sections 20, 87 and 139 make it amply clear that, a person who signs a cheque and makes it over to a payee remains      liable  unless   he  adduces     evidence   to   rebut the presumption that the cheque had been issued for payment of a debt or in discharge of a liability as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Bir Singh Vs. Mukesh Kumar, reported in (2019) 4 SCC 197. It is further held in the said Judgment that, it is immaterial that the cheque may have been filled in by any person other than the drawer, if the cheque is duly signed by the drawer, If the cheque is otherwise valid, penal provisions of Section 138 would be attracted. In para 34 of the said Judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has held as under: "34. If signed blank cheque is voluntarily presented to a payee, towards some payment, the payee may fill up the amount and other particulars.     This in itself would not invalidate the cheque was not in discharge of a debt or liability by adducing evidence." 16.   It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Crl.A. No.1260/2022 (arising from SLP (Crl) No.9836 of 2019) disposed of on 16.08.2022 as under: "15. A drawer who signs a cheque and hands it over to the payee, is presumed to be liable unless the drawer adduces evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheque has been issued towards payment of a debt or in discharge of a liability.   The presumption arises under 16. In Anss rajashekar v. Augustus Jeba Ananth[ (2020) 15 SCC 348] a two Judge Bench of this court, of which one of us (D.Y. Chandrachud J.) was a part, reiterated the decision of the three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa v. Sri Mohan [ (2010) 11 SCC 441] on the presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act. The 12. Section 139 of the Act mandates that it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received it, in discharge, in whole or in part, of a debt, or liability.        the expression      "unless  the  contrary   is proved" indicates that the presumption under Section 139 of the Act is rebuttable. Terming this as an example of a "reverse onus clause" the three- Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa held that in determining whether the presumption has been rebutted, the test of proportionality must guide the determination. The standard of proof for rebuttal of the presumption under Section 139 of the Act is guided by preponderance of probabilities. This court held thus: justifications, reverse onus clauses usually impose an evidentiary burden and not a persuasive burden. Keeping this in view, it is a settled position that when an accused has to rebut the presumption under section 139, the standard of proof for doing so is that of "preponderance of probabilities". Therefore, if the accused is able to raise existence of a legally enforceable debt of liability, the prosecution can fail. As clarified in the citations, the accused can rely on the materials submitted by the complainant in order to raise such a defence and it is conceivable that in some cases the accused may not need to adduce evidence of his/her own." 17.    Thus, the object of Section 138 of the N.I. Act is to infuse credibility to negotiable instruments including cheques and to encourage and promote the use of negotiable instruments including cheques in financial transactions. The penal provision of Section 138 of the N.I. Act is intended to be a deterrent to callous issuance of negotiable instruments such as cheques without serious intention to honour the promise implicit in the issuance of the same. 18.    Keeping in mind the aforesaid legal position, now let me analyse that, whether the Trial Court is right in convicting and sentencing the accused and the First Appellate Court is justified in affirming the Judgment of Principal JMFC, Kadur? 19.   P.W.1 being the complainant has given evidence on par with the allegations made in the complaint. She relies upon a cheque Ex.P1, memos, Exs.P2 and P3, legal notice Ex.P4, UCP receipt   Ex.P5   and  returned   cover  Ex.P6.   She   has   been intensively cross-examined by the counsel for the accused before 20.   So far as issuance of statutory notice is concerned, there is a suggestion to P.W.1 in the cross-examination that, notice was issued by the complainant to the accused. It is also suggested that, a notice is being sent by her. That means, this suggestion goes to establish that, a statutory notice is being issued by the complainant and it is being known to the accused. 21.   It is the specific defence of the accused that, this complainant is not Nagamma but Jayamma. So taking advantage of these two names of this complainant, it is suggested to P.W.1 that, whether she is called as Jayamma also. She has deposed that she is also called as Jayamma.       So far as the name of complainant as Nagamma or Jayamma is concerned, though it is highlighted by the counsel for the accused that this Nagamma is not Jayamma etc. but both complainant and accused adduced the evidence identifying the complainant as Nagamma and Jayamma.     That means she is called as Nagamma as well as Jayamma. Therefore, there is no substance in the submission of the counsel for the accused that, the said cheque was misused etc. by the complainant. 22.    So far as capacity of the complainant to advance the loan to the accused is concerned, she has stated categorically in her cross-examination that, after retirement of her husband, she has received the money.     The said money was kept in the house. When there was a demand by the accused to advance loan to her to meet her legal necessities, she took Rs.1,00,000/- from the said amount and advanced loan to the accused. It is further stated that except this transaction, no other transaction has taken place. There is no further denial of this aspect in the cross- examination by the accused. That means, throughout the cross- examination, the transaction between the complainant and accused have been admitted. Suggestions so directed to P.W.1 are flatly denied by her. When suggestions are denied, they have no evidentiary value.     It is further suggested to P.W.1 that, during the year 2002, accused took a loan of Rs.30,000/- from the complainant and her husband. But the suggestion is denied. It is further suggested that for the due amount, a promissory note was executed. At that time two blank cheques were signed and were taken by the complainant.         But this suggestion is 23.     On a scrupulous reading of the cross-examination, a suggestion with regard to the taking two blank cheques being signed by the accused is being admitted by this accused. So, when there is issuance of blank cheque, the burden lies on the accused to disprove the case of the complainant.     That means initially the burden is on the complainant.   Once the burden is discharged by the complainant, then the onus lies on the accused to disprove the case of the complainant. 24.     Now, let me come to the evidence of D.W.1. It is her specific defence that, name of complainant is not Nagamma but Jayamma. To that effect, she has produced various documents from Exs.D1 to D10. She states that she has not received any amount from the complainant as a loan and the complainant has no financial capacity.   The cross-examination directed D.W.1 is worth reading. She admits that she knew complainant right from the year 1995 onwards. Even she does not know what was the profession of the husband of the complainant. She says that she is working in B.C.M. hostel as a Cook since 1998. She admits that the account with regard to cheque Ex.P1 is standing in her name.   The    said  cheque    Ex.P1  bears her   signature. She volunteers that she has signed the blank cheque and gave it to this complainant. She also admits that after 29.01.2008, the complainant demanded the accused to pay the money. She admits that on 08.02.2008 complainant issued a legal notice to her through her counsel but she has not replied to the said notice. She also admits that there was no necessity for her to issue reply to the said notice. 25.   It is the defence of the accused that there was an agreement between the complainant and accused on 19.12.2007 as per Ex.D10. In that agreement, complainant remembers the old transaction etc. But in the cross-examination she admits that Ex.D1 bears the signature of the complainant.    She denies the suggestion that this cheque was written by her. 26.    To prove the contents of Ex.D10, she has examined DW2 Shivappa who is the scribe of the said document. But the cross- examination reflects that he was not well conversant with the transaction between the complainant and the accused and he is not a licensed scribe. 27.    Thus, on scrupulous reading of the entire evidence led by the parties, so also the Judgments of the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court, it is evident that, the Revision Petitioner - accused has duly issued the cheque in question for Rs.1,00,000/- in favour of the complainant, in discharge of a debt or liability, the cheque was presented to the banker for payment. However the cheque returned unpaid for want of sufficient funds in the account of the revision petitioner - accused. Statutory notice of dishonour was duly issued to her. There was no response from the revision petitioner - accused. 28.   With regard to the defence so taken by the accused that Ex.D10 is a document which is being signed by the complainant therefore it is duly put up in accordance with law. The Trial Court records would show that, Ex.D10 was referred for an expert opinion.    The expert has given the opinion that, specimen signature of the complainant did not tally with the disputed signature of Ex.D10. There is no further challenge of this finding of the hand-writing expert by the revision petitioner - accused before any forum.      That means the said finding of the expert opinion has reached finality. That means Ex.D10 so relied on by the accused is not a valid document as per the argument of the learned counsel for the complainant. Thus, the Trial Court and First Appellate Court arrived at the specific concurrent factual finding  that    Ex.D10   admittedly   was   not  signed   by   the 29.   The learned Trial Court and the First Appellate Court rejected the plea of the accused that the complainant had misused the blank signed cheque made over by the accused to the complainant. In view of the admissions of the accused in the cross-examination, it can be said that, the Trial Court and First Appellate Court are right in making such a factual finding based on the evidence placed on record. 30.    The provisions of Section 139 of the N.I. Act mandates that unless the contrary is proved, it is to be presumed that the holder of the cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 of the N.I. Act in discharge of any whole or any part of any debt or other liability. 31.    Needless to mention that the presumption contemplated under Section 139 of the N.I. Act is rebuttable presumption. However, the onus of proving that the cheque was not in discharge of any debt or other liability is on the accused, drawer of the cheque. 32.    In  a   Judgment     reported   in   Hiten   P  Dalal   Vs. Batindranath Banerjee, reported in (2001) 6 SCC 16, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has held that, both Section 138 and 139 require that the Court shall presume the liability of the drawer of the cheques for the amounts for which the cheques are drawn. In the said Judgment, a Judgment in State of Madras Vs. Vaidyanath Iyer reported in AIR 1958 SC 61 has been followed, wherein it was held that, it was obligatory on the court to raise this presumption. 33.   Section 139 introduces an exception to the general rule as to the burden of proof and shifts the onus on the accused. The presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act is a presumption of law as distinguished from presumption of facts. Presumptions are rules of evidence and do not conflict with the presumption of innocence, which requires the prosecution to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The obligation on the   prosecution    may    be discharged    with   the  help  of presumptions of law and presumptions of fact unless the accused adduces evidence showing the reasonable possibility of the non existence of the presumed fact. 34.   It is said that presumption of innocence is undoubtedly a human right as contended on behalf of the Revision Petitioner - accused. However the guilt may be established by recourse to presumptions in law and presumptions of facts as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in various Judgments. 35.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Lakshmi Dyechem Vs. State of Gujarat and others reported in (2012) 13 SCC 375 reiterated that, in view of Section 139, it has to be presumed that a cheque was issued in discharge of a debt or other liability but the presumption could be rebutted by adducing evidence. The burden of proof was however on the person who wanted to rebut the presumption. 36.   If these principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India are applied to the present facts of the case, in view of the provisions of Section 139 of the N.I. Act read with Section 118 thereof, the Court had to presume that the cheque had been issued discharging a debt or liability. The said presumption was rebuttable and could be rebutted by the accused by proving contrary. In this case, there is just a denial. But mere denial or rebuttal by the accused is not enough. The accused has to prove by cogent evidence that there was no debt or liability. 37.   As observed above, the Trial Court, on analysis of the evidence adduced by the respective parties arrived at the factual finding that the petitioner - accused had duly issued the cheque Ex.P1 for Rs.1,00,000/- in favour of respondent - complainant, in discharge of a debt or a liability, the cheque was presented to the bank for payment within the period of its validity, but the cheque had been returned unpaid for want of sufficient funds in the account of the petitioner - accused in the bank on which the cheque was drawn. Statutory notice of dishonour was duly issued to which there was no response from the petitioner - 38.   The Appellate Court affirmed the aforesaid factual findings. The learned Trial Court and the Appellate Court arrived at the specific concurrent and factual finding that the cheque had admittedly been signed by the Revision Petitioner - accused. The learned Trial Court and the      Appellate Court rejected the plea of the petitioner - accused that the complainant - respondent had misused the blank signed cheque made over by the petitioner - accused to her. 39.   It is settled that, even a blank cheque leaf, validly signed and handed over by the accused, which is towards some payment, would attract presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act, in the absence of any cogent evidence to show that, the cheque was not issued in discharge of a debt.         Thus, in the absence of any finding that the cheque in question was not signed by the petitioner - accused or not voluntarily made over to the payee and in the absence of any evidence with regard to the circumstances in which a blank signed cheque had been given to the complainant, it may reasonably be presumed that the cheque was filled in by the complainant being the payee. In my considered opinion, the Trial Court and the Appellate Court have rightly appreciated the evidence placed on record by both the parties. 40.   There is no acceptable grounds to interfere with the concurrent findings of both the Courts. More so, the powers the Revisional Court are well settled. Now the question that comes is whether the Revisional Court has got the jurisdiction to interfere with the finding of the Trial Court and First Appellate Court. It is well settled that in exercise of revision jurisdiction under Section 397 Cr.P.C., the High Court, does not in the absence of perversity, interfere in the concurrent factual findings. It is not for the Revisional Court to analyse and re-appreciate the evidence on record. 41.    It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in a Judgment reported in (2008) 14 SCC 457 in Southern Sales and Services and others Vs. Sauermilch Design and Handles GmbH, it is well established principle of law that, the Revisional Court will not interfere even if a wrong order is passed by a Court having jurisdiction, in the absence of a jurisdictional 42.    It is well settled that in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 397 of code of Criminal procedure, the High Court does not, in the absence of perversity, upset concurrent factual findings. It is not for the Revisional Court to re-analyse and re- interpret the evidence on record. That means, interference by the High Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction is limited to the exceptional cases.     viz.(i) When it is found that order under revision suffers from glaring illegality or has caused miscarriage of justice, (2) When it is found that Trial Court has no jurisdiction to try the case. (3) When Trial Court has illegally shut out the evidence which otherwise ought to have been considered and (4) Where material evidence which clinches the issue has been overlooked. 43.    It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Gujarat Vs Afroz Mohammad Hasanfatta, reported in 2019 CRL. L.J. 3366, 338(SC) that "while hearing revision under section 397 of Cr.P.C., the High court does not sit as an Appellate Court and will not re-appreciate the evidence unless the judgment of the trial court suffers from perversity". 44.    Therefore the conviction of the petitioner - accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is to be 45.    At the time of admission 25% was deposited. The balance amount shall be deposited in the Trial Court within four weeks from today, failing which, the default sentence follows as imposed by the Trial Court. Criminal Revision Petition so filed is dismissed. Judgment of conviction and sentence dated 05.03.2013 passed by Principal Civil Judge & JMFC, Kadur in C.C No.401/2008 affirmed by II Addl.   Dist.&   Session     Judge    Chikkamagalur   in   Crl. A. No.152/2013,     by   Judgment     dated  13.11.2013   are  hereby Revision Petitioner is directed to deposit the fine amount before the Trial Court within four weeks from today.       On such deposit, Trial Court is directed to release the compensation amount so awarded to the complainant. Send back the Trial Court and Sessions Court records,
Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another Counsel for Applicant :- Umesh Pal Singh Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A. Counter affidavit filed by the learned A.G.A., is taken on Heard learned counsel for the applicant as well as learned A.G.A. and perused the record. The accused- applicant, Manoj Saxena, is involved in Case Crime No.189 of 2022, under Sections 376A, B, 354 I.P.C. & It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant that there is general allegation in the FIR. In the statements under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. of the victim, there is no ingredient of Section 376 I.P.C. No medical has been conducted as the parents of the victim denied to get her daughter medically examined. No injury has been found on the person of the victim. In fact the father of the victim is a police personnel and this FIR is only the misuse of that power. The applicant is 50 years of age so the incident appears to be suspicious. He is languishing in jail since 13.04.2022 and in case he is enlarged on bail he will not misuse the liberty of bail. Hence, bail has been prayed for. Learned A.G.A. has opposed the bail application and submitted that as per medical report, the victim is 10 years of age and as per school leaving certificate the age of the girl is seven years. From the perusal of the FIR, it appears that in the absence of other family members when eight years old victim was alone at her home and when she saw her TV dish connection was disturbed, she called Manoj Saxena (applicant), the person who used to go to repair the dish connection. When Manoj Saxena (applicant) came inside the house, he saw the girl alone at her home, he started vulgar activities with her. The victim made hue and cry then he ran away from the house. In the statement under Section 161 Cr.PC. the victim has stated that when Manoj Saxena came in the house of the first informant to repair the dish connection, seeing the girl alone at her home he inserted his hand in her clothes and kissed her on lips. As per statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. of the victim, Manoj Saxena came at the house of the first informant repaired the dish connection then hold her tightly and kissed on her lips, inserted his hand into her panty and also pressed her breast by inserting her hands therein. Admittedly, the parents of the victim have denied for any medical examination of the victim. Having heard the submissions of learned counsel of both sides, considering the seriousness of the charge and the severity of punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence, prima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of the charge, reformative theory of punishment, and larger mandate of the Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the dictum of Apex Court in the case of Dataram Singh v. State of U.P. and another, reported in (2018) 2 SCC 22 and without expressing any opinion on the merit of the case, I find it to be a case of bail. Let the applicant, Manoj Saxena, who is involved in aforesaid crime be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions. 1. The applicant will attend and co-operate in the trial pending before the court concerned on the date fixed after release. 2. He will not tamper with the witnesses. 3. He will not indulge himself in any illegal activities during the bail period. The identity, status and residential proof of sureties will be verified by the court concerned and in case of breach of any of the above conditions, the court below shall be at liberty to cancel the bail and send the applicant to prison. It is clarified that the observations, if any, made in this order are strictly confined to the disposal of this bail application and must not be construed to have any reflection on the ultimate merits of the case. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. Location: High Court of Judicature at
The Appellants are before this Court assailing the Judgment dated 20.02.2018, passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Misc. Appeal No. 938/2010. The said appeal before the High Court was filed by the claimants in Motor Vehicles Claim Case No. 176/2009 seeking enhancement of the compensation as against the amount awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT ‘for short’). The Tribunal, on assessing the evidence available before it, had awarded a sum of Rs.4,99,000/- (Rupees Four Lacs Ninety-Nine Thousand) with 6% interest on the said amount. In the appeal filed by the claimants, the High Court, having considered the matter in detail has concluded as here under: “Having accepted monthly income of the deceased to be Rs.8,000/- which has been proved through Income Tax returns, the admissible income of the deceased would have been Rs.6,000/- per month after 1/4th deduction for personal expenses and the annual income of the deceased would come to Rs.72,000/-. When multiplier of 17 is applied then the total income comes to Rs. 12,24,000/- . On this amount, a sum of Rs. 70,000/- will be added on various heads as has been granted by the Supreme Court in the case of National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi & Others as reported in 2017 SCC Online Sc 1270, 40% future prospect is also to be added. Thus the total amounts comes to Rs.17,83,600/-. Accordingly, the amount awarded by the Claims Tribunal i.e. Rs.4,99,000/- stands enhanced to Rs.17,83,600/-. Therefore, the claimants would have been entitled to additional sum of Rs.12,84,600/- with interest @ 6% per annum on the aforesaid enhanced amount, but the fact is that valuation of the appeal is only Rs.6,50,000/as amended vide I.A.No.5342/2014 which was allowed on 29.04.2016, therefore, appellants shall be entitled only to enhanced compensation to the extent of valuation of the appeal i.e. Rs.6,50,000/- along with interest @ 6 % per annum from the date as has been awarded by the Claims Tribunal. From the perusal of the above extracted portion, it is seen that the High Court having taken into consideration all the parameters for arriving at the just compensation, had enhanced the amount to Rs. 17,83,600/- (Rupees Seventeen Lacs Eight Three Thousand Six Hundred Only). From the said amount, the initial the amount awarded by the Tribunal was deducted and the amount of Rs. 12,84,600/- (Rupees Twelve Lacs Eight Four Thousand Six Hundred) was arrived at. However, the High Court, having taken into consideration that the valuation made in the Appeal was only for Rs. 6,50,000/- (Rupees Six Lacs Fifty Thousand Only) has awarded the said sum a enhanced compensation. The only issue that arises for consideration in this Appeal is as to whether the High Court was justified in restricting the award of the enhanced amount to Rs. 6,50,000/(Rupees Six Lacs Fifty Thousand Only) though, the amount of compensation determined was Rs. 12,84,600/- (Rupees Twelve Lacs Eight Four Thousand Six The law is well settled that in the matter of compensation, the amount actually due and payable is to be awarded despite the claimants having sought for a lesser amount and the claim petition being valued at a lesser value. Our view, is fortified by the decision of this Court in the Case of Ramla and Others Versus National Insurance Company Limited and Others 2019 2 SCC 192, wherein, it is “Though the claimants had claimed a total compensation of Rs.25,00,000 in their claim petition filed before the Tribunal, we feel that the compensation which the claimants are entitled to is higher than the same as mentioned supra. There is no restriction that the Court cannot award compensation exceeding the claimed amount, since the function of the Tribunal or Court under Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is to award “just compensation”. The Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial and welfare legislation. A “just compensation” is one which is reasonable on the basis of evidence produced on record. It cannot be said to have become time-barred. Further, there is no need for a new cause of action to claim an enhanced amount. The Courts are duty-bound to award just compensation. (See the Judgments of this Court in (a) Nagappa v. Gurudayal Singh, (b) Magma General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nanu Ram, (c) Ibrahim v. Raju. In that view, the Judgment dated 20th February, 2018 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh is modified. It is held that the Appellants are entitled to the enhanced compensation of Rs. 12,84,600/- (Rupees Twelve Lacs Eight Four Thousand Six Hundred) with 6% interest, which shall be paid by the Insurance Company by depositing it before the MACT within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this Judgment. The Appeal is accordingly, allowed.

Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                           Page 3 of 10 3.7     It has been further agreed that the petitioner no.1 shall facilitate transfer of mobile no. 9811770993 with Vodafone service provided in favour of respondent no.2, he shall perform all the obligations and requirements in the said regard as may be required by the service provider and provide NOC, ID etc. at the time of recording the statement under Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 3.8     It is agreed between the parties that the custody and guardianship of the minor child Advik, aged about 9 years shall remain with respondent no.2 who shall be the sole custodian of the child.

It is to be noted here that apart from usual Sections invoked in matrimonial disputes, i.e., Section 406/498A/34 IPC, in the present FIR, Sections 354/377 IPC have also been invoked. Now the matter has been settled between the parties and this Court has to take a call as to whether the FIR in question can be quashed. A co-ordinate bench presided over by HMJ Subramonium Prasad in CRL.M.C. No. 599/2021 tilted ‘Rifakat Ali & Ors Vs. State & Anr.’ decided on 26.02.2021 has taken the following view on a quashing petition filed under the similar circumstances: “The power of the High Courts to quash FIRs while exercising its powers under Section 482 CrPC even for offences which are not compoundable under Cr.PC has been settled in a number of judgments. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab & Anr. reported as (2012) 10 SCC 303, the Supreme Court has observed as under: "61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised thus : the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                          Page 5 of 10 nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding." After relying on Gian Singh (supra), this position has been laid down in Narinder Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Anr. reported as (2014) 6 SCC 466, wherein the Supreme Court has observed as "29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                           Page 6 of 10 compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter between themselves. However, this power is to be exercised sparingly and with caution. 29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on that basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases would be to secure: (i) ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court While exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives. 29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for the offences alleged to have been committed under special statute like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender. 29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves. 29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as to whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal cases." In State of M.P. v. Laxmi Narayan & Ors. reported as (2019) 5 SCC 688, the Supreme Court has observed as under : "15. Considering the law on the point and the other decisions of this Court on the point, referred to hereinabove, it is observed and held 15.1. That the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to quash the criminal proceedings for the non-compoundable offences under Section 320 of the Code can be exercised having Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                           Page 7 of 10 overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the parties have resolved the entire dispute amongst themselves; 15.2. Such power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involved heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society; 15.3. Similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences under the special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender;" A perusal of the three judgments show that the Supreme Court has consistently held that the power under Section 482 CrPC should not be used for quashing heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity etc. since these offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact in society. An offence under Section 377 IPC is a henious offence and points to the mental depravity of the accused and hence ought not to be quashed by the High Court on the basis of compromise by exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC. The present case arises out of matrimonial dispute and the allegation has been made by the wife against the husband. The parties have decided to part ways and move ahead in their lives without having any acrimony against each other. In the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is inclined to exercise its powers under Section 482 CrPC even for an offence under Section 377 IPC on the ground that the dispute is private in nature. The learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on orders of this Court in CRL.M.C.830/2019 titled as Dinesh Kumar & Ors. v. State & Anr., CRL.M.C.1613/2019 titled as Anmol Katyal & Ors. v. State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr., CRL.M.C. 5216/2018 titled as Gajender Singh & Ors. v. State (NCT of Delhi) & Ors. and CRL.M.C. 4117/2018 titled as Joginder Singh Bote & Ors. v. NCT of Delhi & Anr. In all these cases wife has levelled allegations on the husband committing an offence under Section 377 IPC. This Court has exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC and Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                          Page 8 of 10 has quashed the FIRs on the basis of the compromise entered into between the husband and wife. It is made clear that this Court is exercising its powers under Section 482 CrPC to quash an offence of Section 377 IPC on the ground that the parties have compromised the matter with each other only because it arises out of a matrimonial dispute, the allegation has been levelled by wife against her husband of committing an offence under Section 377 IPC and the parties have decided to move ahead in life.” 6.      So, the view of the co-ordinate bench is that in matrimonial cases, where settlement has taken place, even the offence under Section 377 IPC can be compromised and FIR can be quashed as parties have to move ahead in life. I concur with the said view. Keeping in view the fact that parties have settled all their disputes, hence the offence under Section 354 IPC is also allowed to be quashed to put an end to all bickerings between the parties and allow them to begin a new chapter of their lives. 7.      Today, parties are present in the Court and have been identified by the Investigating Officer. The remaining payment of Rs.8,75,000/- is made by way of a DD No. 122692 dated 05.05.2022 drawn on Axis Bank in favour of respondent No. 2. The respondent No.2/complainant states that she has settled all her matrimonial disputes with the petitioners out of her own free will, without pressure, coercion or undue influence and states that she does not want to pursue with the present case any further and requests that the present FIR and the proceeding emanating therefrom may be quashed. 8.      The parties understand the implication of the present proceedings. In view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, this Court is of the opinion that no useful purpose will be served in continuing with the present proceedings. Resultantly, FIR No.003/2016 for offences under Sections Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                          Page 9 of 10 406/498A/354/377/34 IPC, registered at Police Station Crime Women Cell, Nanak Pura and the proceedings emanating therefrom are hereby quashed. The parties shall remain bound by the terms of the settlement and the undertakings given to the Court. 9.      The petition stands disposed of in above terms. Signed By:HARIOM      CrlM.C. 1356/2022                                           Page 10 of 10
