In W.P.No.3451/2020 the petitioner is before this Court aggrieved by the rejection of IA filed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short ‘the Act’) seeking litigation expenses of Rs.75,000/-. In WP.No.24220/2021 the petitioner is before this Court praying for a direction to the Family Court for expeditious disposal of M.C.No.838/2018. 2.   The petitioner in W.P.No.24220/2021 is the husband whereas the petitioner in W.P.No.3451/2020 is the wife of the petitioner in 24220/2021. The parties to the proceedings would be referred to as they stand in the W.P.No.3451/2020. 3.   The petitioner and respondent are husband and wife, marriage having taken place on 26.12.2011. From the marriage they have two children. The husband respondent filed petition under 13(1) (i) and (ia) of the Act seeking dissolution of marriage in M.C.No.838/2018. In the said M.C. the petitioner wife filed an application under Section 24 of the Act claiming litigation expenses of Rs.75,000/- to engage the advocate and to contest the proceedings. The trial Court rejected the application holding that it is for the petitioner-wife to approach District Legal Service Authority    for   legal assistance   and  there   is  no provisions to direct the respondent-Husband to pay litigation expenses. 4.   It   is   submitted  that  the   respondent- Husband is working as Head of Human Resources and receiving salary of more than Rs.80,000/- per month. The petitioner-wife has no income of her own and it is submitted that the petitioner wife is looking after two children. In the above circumstances, the respondent- Husband is liable to pay some amount towards litigation expenses. The amount which is sought for by the   petitioner-Wife  i.e.,   Rs.75,000/-  as litigation expenses is on the higher side. 5.    I deem it proper and appropriate to direct respondent-Husband to pay a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards litigation expenses to the petitioner-wife. Accordingly, W.P.No.3451/2021 is partly allowed. 6.    The respondent-Husband is directed to deposit    a   sum  of  Rs.25,000/-    towards litigation expenses before the Prl. Judge, Family Court at Mysuru. The petitioner–wife is at liberty to withdraw the said amount. 7.    In W.P.No.24220/2021 the petitioner is seeking for early disposal of M.C.No.838/2018. It is submitted by both the learned counsels that it is at the stage of evidence of respondent-Wife. 8.   Both petitioner and respondent are directed to co-operate with the trial Court for the early disposal of the case. The trial court is directed to dispose of M.C.No.838/2018 in an expeditious manner. With the above, both the writ petitions are disposed of.
1.    This appeal arises out of an unfortunate dispute between the appellant no.1 - wife and the respondent no.1 - husband over the custody of their minor male child Aaditya Kiran. This appeal takes an exception to the Judgment and order dated 31 st August 2021 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in a petition for habeas corpus filed by the respondent no.1 herein for seeking custody of the minor. 2.    The respondent no.1 and the appellant no.1 were married in New York, United States of America (for short “USA”) on 13 th January 2011. The child was born in USA on 21st January 2016. Thus, the child is a citizen of USA by birth and is holding a USA passport. Unfortunately, the child was diagnosed with hydronephrosis which required surgery. It is the case of the respondent no.1 that as they were not in a position to secure an appointment of a doctor in USA for surgery, it was agreed between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 that the child will undergo surgery at Max Hospital, Saket.     As the child is a citizen of USA, consent for international travel with one legal guardian was executed by and between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 on 4 th February 2019. The consent was recorded in the said document to enable the child to travel with the mother – the appellant no.1 to India. The consent was executed for the period between 5th February 2019 to 26th September 2019. The consent document recorded that the child will be leaving USA on 5 th February 2019 and will be returning back to USA on 26 th September 2019. It was further recorded that any changes to this plan shall be discussed and consented to by both the parents. A certificate dated 17 th September 2019 issued by Dr. Anurag Krishna, Director, Paediatrics and Paediatric Surgery of Max Hospital, Saket, New Delhi records that the child underwent a surgery on 14th March 2019.      It records that he had examined the child on 12 th July 2019 when he found that the child was doing well. Dr. Anurag Krishna has recorded that the child needs to be reviewed 6 to 7 months post-surgery along with a fresh ultrasound and renal scan. 3.    It is the case of the respondent no.1 that at the time of surgery, he flew down to India. After the surgery, he returned to USA for his work. It is brought on record that the respondent no.1 has a status of permanent resident in USA which is valid up to 16 th August 2031. According to the case of the respondent no.1, the appellant no.1 violated the international travel consent by not allowing the minor child to come back to USA by 26 th September 2019. According to the respondent no.1, the appellant no.1 detained the minor in her illegal custody in India. Therefore, the respondent no.1 filed a petition on 30th January 2020 before the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas, USA, which according to the respondent no.1 is the Court of competent jurisdiction. The petition was filed for seeking primary care, control, and custody of the minor on account of his wrongful detention outside USA. On 3rd February 2020, the Circuit Court passed an interim order granting primary care, custody, and control of the minor child to the respondent no.1 and directed the appellant no.1 to return the child to the respondent no.1. In the petition for habeas corpus filed by the respondent no.1 in the High Court, he has stated that though a copy of the said order of the Circuit Court was forwarded to the appellant no.1 by email, she continues to detain the minor child in India.      In the circumstances, the respondent no.1 filed a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana and prayed for a direction to the State of Haryana to secure the release of the minor child from the illegal custody of the present appellants. The appellant nos.2 and 3 are the parents of the appellant no.1 who are residents of Gurgaon in Haryana. At present, the appellant no.1 is staying with them. Various interim orders were passed in the said petition from time to time. The High Court appointed a learned counsel as amicus curiae, who interacted with the appellant no.1 as well as the respondent no.1 on phone/WhatsApp calls with a view to ascertain their respective stands. He also submitted a report. By the impugned Judgment and order, the writ petition filed by the respondent no.1 was allowed. In paragraph 55, the High Court issued following directions: - “(i) respondent No.2 is directed to return to USA along with minor child on or before 30.09.2021; (ii) in case respondent No.2 opts to return to USA, the petitioner shall bear the travel and incidental expenses of respondent No.2 and the minor child for return to and also the expenses for their stay in USA till decision of the custody petition and the petitioner shall not initiate any criminal/contempt proceedings against respondent No.2 for inter (iii) if respondent No.2 fails to comply with aforesaid direction, respondent No.2 shall hand over custody of the minor child and his passport to the petitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other (iv) in case respondent No.2 fails to hand over custody of the minor child and her passport to the petitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other date as may be agreed to by the petitioner, respondent No.1 shall take over the custody and passport of the minor child from respondent No.2 and hand over custody and passport of the minor child to the petitioner on such date as may be agreed to (v) on custody of the minor child and his passport being handed over to the petitioner, the petitioner shall be entitled to take the minor child to USA; (vi) in case passport of the minor child is not handed over to the petitioner or respondent No.1 by respondent No.2 on the ground of loss/damage etc., the petitioner shall be entitled to get the duplicate passport issued from the concerned (vii) on such return of the minor child to USA, either of the parties shall be at liberty to revive the proceedings before US Court for appropriate orders regarding appointment of guardian and grant of custody of the minor child.” 4.     Further directions were issued in paragraphs 57 and 58 by the High Court based on a decision of this Court in the case of Yashita Sahu v. State of Rajasthan1. Paragraphs 57 and 58 read thus:- Sahu's case (supra) it is ordered that till filing of any such application by either of the parties for revival of the proceedings before the US Court and passing of any interim/final order by the US Court of competent jurisdiction on the same, respondent No.2 shall be entitled to visit the child and have his temporary custody from 10:00 a.m. between the petitioner and respondent No.2 if respondent No.2 returns to and stays in USA or make video calls to the minor child for about half respondent No.2 does not return to and stay in USA and in such an eventuality, the petitioner parents/other relatives once in a year. 58. However, nothing in this order shall prevent the parties from adopting any joint parenting plan minor child such as by arranging admission of the minor child in some school with hostel facility and by visiting her during holidays and taking her custody during vacation as may be permitted by the school authorities. It is also further clarified that the observations in the present order have present writ petition and shall not bind any Court involving question of custody or welfare of the child.” 5.    As per the assurance recorded in the order dated 24th September 2021 of this Court, the respondent no.1 has secured a USA visa to the appellant no.1 of the B-2 non-immigrant category. As can be seen from the order dated 24th November 2021, this Court made an attempt to ascertain whether an amicable solution could be found to the dispute. Both sides were directed to submit their suggestions for the amicable resolution of the dispute. However, an amicable resolution of the dispute was not possible. 6.    The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that even after surgery, the child needs constant medical care. She submitted that any lapses could be extremely fatal for the life of the minor. She submitted that the doctor who operated upon the child has advised a very strict care regime for the child. She pointed out that constant monitoring of his health is required.    Even the water intake of the child has to be carefully monitored. She pointed out that even the appellant no.3, the grandmother of the child is taking care of the minor child and there is a family support available as she is residing with her parents.        She pointed out that a detailed affidavit has been filed by the appellant no.1 indicating reasons why in the interest of the child he should be in India till he is 9-10 years old. 7.    Relying upon the material on record, she submitted that even the respondent no.1 constantly wished to settle down in India and therefore, he purchased more and more land in India and especially in Bangalore. The learned counsel pointed out that it was the respondent no.1 who himself selected a pre-school for the child while he was in India in April, 2019. She submitted that the respondent no.1 since the time he got married to the appellant no.1 made plans to move back to India permanently and was planning to construct a farm house and a residential house in Bangalore. She submitted that it was the desire of the respondent no.1 that the appellant no.1 should work in India. Accordingly, property was bought in Bangalore where the mother of the respondent no.1 resides. The learned counsel pointed out that after emails dated 25 th December 2019 and 14th January 2020 were forwarded by the appellant no.1 to return the money to the appellant no.2 taken from him for land purchase in Bangalore, the aforesaid petition was filed by the respondent no.1 in the Court at Arkansas 8.      In the written submissions of the appellants, there are various factors pointed out, such as the temperamental nature of the respondent no.1 and the conduct of the respondent no.1. The learned counsel submitted that this Court has held that principles of autonomy must inure in the individual against non-state persons as well. She submitted that in custody cases, a woman cannot be completely eliminated in the name of the welfare of the child. She urged that the woman cannot be deprived of her rights. She submitted that in any case, the appellant no.1 is the primary/sole caretaker of the child. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur Sandhu v. Harbax Singh Sandhu and Another2, Elizabeth Dinshaw (Mrs.) v. Arvand M. Dinshaw and Another 3 and Nithya Anand Raghavan v. State (NCT of Delhi) and Another4, the learned counsel submitted that there is a statutory presumption in favour of the appellant no.1 under the doctrine of tender years. She submitted that this doctrine has been upheld in the aforesaid three cases and this Court asserted maternal preference as found under Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (the Act of 1956). She submitted that the appellant no.1 is the primary caregiver and therefore, it is in the child’s best interest to retain the custody with the appellant no.1. 9.     The learned counsel submitted that to compel the appellant no.1 who is the primary caregiver to return to USA under the rule of “best interest of child” will amount to an invasion of her fundamental right of autonomy which is a part of the right of privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. By adopting a summary procedure, such invasion on the rights of the appellant no.1 cannot be made. She submitted that the welfare of the child will mean balancing the interests of all in the family of the child. The mother being the primary caregiver must be kept in mind by the Court and her legal rights must be respected and protected by the Court.    She submitted that the appellant no.1 is a fit mother and, in patriarchy, some special care is needed to counter the dominant presence of the father of the child. The learned counsel extensively relied upon an Article by Mr.John Ekelaar under the title “Beyond the welfare principle”. She submitted that the best interest of the child is the primary principle which also means the welfare of each member of the family of the child. She submitted that the matter in patriarchy becomes also a matter of gender rights which is a constitutional issue covered under Article 14 read with Article 15(3) of the Constitution of India.       She submitted that the constitutional provisions recognize that women form a separate category who need to be enabled by the law. 10.    She submitted that the citizenship of a child has nothing to do with the welfare principle.   A child may be a citizen of any country, but if the competent Court finds that it is in the best interest of the child that he is brought up in India, the child should be permitted to stay in India. The learned counsel invited our attention to a decision of this Court in the case of Kanika Goel v. the State of Delhi through Station House Officer and another5 as well as a decision in the case of Prateek Gupta v. Shilpi Gupta and others6. She submitted that in these two cases, though the child was a foreign citizen, it was found to be in the best interest that the child remains in India to continue with the prime caregiver. Her submission is that in this case, the child can continue to be an American citizen and stay in India on the basis of an OCI card. She submitted that eventually, the child can make his own choice at the age of 18. 11.    The learned counsel submitted that the decisions in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) are binding precedents as the same are rendered by the Benches consisting of three Hon’ble Judges.                She submitted that the High Court has completely ignored the binding precedents. She submitted that the learned Judge of the High Court cannot decide the case based on his subjective personal opinion. She submitted that it is necessary that clear and consistent law be followed even in the custody matters and judicial discretion is not used to subvert the evolving 12.    The learned counsel submitted that in this case, a writ of habeas corpus was not maintainable as the custody of the appellant no.1 is not illegal. She pointed out that in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra), directions were issued to the Family Court to complete the hearing of custody matters within a time frame. The learned counsel submitted that in the cases of Yashita (supra) and Lahari Sakhamuri v. Sobhan Kodali7, an exception was made to the rule laid down, in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) as in these two cases, the mothers had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court in USA. 13.    She reiterated that in the name of welfare and interest of the child, the welfare of one of the parents cannot be eliminated altogether. The learned counsel submitted that the appellant no.1 cannot be compelled to go back to USA. Her submission is that if the child is placed in the custody of the respondent no.1 on the ground that the appellant no.1 is not interested in going to USA, the child will be reduced to a chattel. 14.    The learned counsel submitted that to refuse a woman the right of mothering is refusing to acknowledge and respect a very core biological and social identity. She submitted that a custody dispute cannot be decided purely in the facts of each case. She submitted that the law laid down in the case of Nithya (supra) has to be followed as recently done by Bombay High Court in the case of Chandima Janaka Wijesinghe v. Union of India and others in Crl. Writ Petition No. 547 of 2021. 15.    The learned counsel submitted that the issue of medical evaluation of the child requires a detailed hearing. She submitted that the visa granted to the appellant no.1 is only a tourist visa which would entitle her to visit USA only for specific enlisted reasons.     She submitted that the stand of the respondent no.1 of supporting the appellant no.1 for getting the visa is illusory. She pointed out that the respondent no.1, by relying upon alleged legal separation, has contended that he cannot support the application for a grant of a green card to the appellant no.1. The learned counsel also invited our attention to the pleadings in the interlocutory applications filed by the respondent no.1. She submitted that the conduct of the respondent no.1 of making allegations in the applications shows that he is more interested in litigation and winning the battle against the appellant no.1 rather than acting in collaboration with her for the benefit of the child. 16.    The learned counsel further submitted that the Indian medical system is better suited for taking care of the minor son and even the appellant no.3 is a doctor. She submitted that it is not in the interest of the minor son that he is taken to USA. 17.    She submitted that considering the unique facts of the case, the larger Bench decisions of this Court in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) are applicable. She submitted that the said two decisions constitute binding precedents and the cases of Lahiri (supra) and Yashita (supra) are exceptions to the general rule. She submitted that the concept of forum convenience has no place in the Guardianship proceedings. She submitted that this is not a case of abduction of the child as the child was brought to India with the consent of the respondent no.1 for the purposes of medical treatment. Therefore, the learned counsel submitted that the offer given by the respondent no.1 cannot be accepted for the reasons set out in the written submissions.       She submitted that the impugned Judgment is erroneous and illegal which deserves to be set aside. 18.   The learned counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 pointed out that the appellant no.1 has spent more than nine years in USA. After her marriage with the respondent no.1, she has spent eight years in USA. He invited our attention to the consent executed by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 for permitting the child to travel to India between 5 th February 2019 to 26th September, 2019. He submitted that in the light of the increase in cases of international parental child abduction from the USA, the Immigration Authorities in USA do not allow a minor US citizen to leave the country only with one parent without the express consent of the non-travelling parent. He submitted that after the consent document was executed, no changes therein were even discussed between the parties. He submitted that documents on record will show that in terms of the international travel consent form, return tickets of 26 th September, 2019 were also booked. He submitted that in violation of the international travel consent, the appellant no.1 has not sent back the minor son to USA, which amounts to the detention of the minor in her illegal custody in India. 19.   The learned counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 submitted that there is no document produced on record by the appellants to show that the child needs continuous follow-up treatment. 20.   The learned counsel submitted that in terms of the interim order dated 10th June 2020 of the High Court, the respondent no.1 has been interacting regularly with his minor son through video conference and there is a very healthy and deep father and son relationship between them. He stated that he has taken legal advice from a firm specialising in immigration law in USA. He submitted that the respondent no.1 received advice from the said firm that to enable the appellant no.1 and the child to travel to USA, the quickest as well as legally and practically most viable way to get a visa was to get a B-2 non-immigrant visa. 21.   He pointed out that in the visa invitation letter, the respondent no.1 has clarified that he will take care of tour expenses of the appellant no.1, including the round trip, airfare, food, housing, medical insurance in USA. The learned counsel submitted that the order of the High Court is a very balanced order which is consistent with the law laid down by this Court in the cases of Lahiri (supra) and Yashita (supra).        He would, therefore, submit that there is no reason to interfere with the equitable order passed by the High Court. 22.   We have given a careful consideration to the submissions.          The appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 got married on 13 th January 2011 in New York in USA. The minor son was born on 21 st January 2016 and is admittedly a citizen of USA. There is no dispute regarding the appellant no.1 and respondent no.1 signing and executing a consent for travel of the minor to India with one legal guardian. It is necessary to reproduce the said I, Kiran Bhaskar of 321 Division St, Cenerton, AR 72719, United States declare that I am the legal parent/guardian of Aaditya Kiran, male, born certificate registration number 2016001506, issued numbered 546227929, issued on October 14, 2016 at United States, Department of State. My child, Aaditya Kiran, has consent to travel: (February 5th, 2019 to September 26th, 2019), C/o (February 5th, 2019 to September 26th, 2019), C/o, with Vasudha Sethi (my wife, Aaditya’s mother) of States. Vasudha Sethi has an Indian passport numbered J0499893, which was issued on June 8, 2010 at Regional Passport Office, Delhi, India. My child will be leaving the United States on February 5th, 2019 and returning to the United States on September 26th, 2019. Any changes to this plan shall be discussed and consented upon by both parties. Any questions regarding this document may be Signed on this 4th day of February, 2019. 23.  It is not the case of the appellant no.1 that there was even a discussion between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 for modification of the said consent till date. Admittedly, the period of travel mentioned in the consent was not extended by the respondent no.1. The minor son underwent surgery at the hands of Dr. Anurag Krishna on 14 th March 2019.       The certificate dated 17th September 2019 issued by Dr.Anurag Krishna records that he examined the minor on 12 th July, 2019 and he found that the child was doing well.           He has recorded in the certificate that the child needs to be reviewed 6 to 7 months after the surgery along with fresh ultrasound and renal scan. Thus, the surgery has taken place 33 months back. The appellant has not placed on record any medical certificate or opinion of Dr.Anurag Krishna on the present health condition of the child. The appellants have not placed on record any medical certificate of the treating doctor recording that the child needs any further treatment or medical care in India. The respondent no.1 consented for the child travelling to India and remaining in India till 26 th September 2019. The reason for the grant of consent was to enable the minor to undergo surgery in New Delhi. We will have to proceed on the footing that there is no documentary evidence available on record to show that the presence of the child in India for further medical treatment is necessary. 24.    On 3rd February, 2020, the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas, USA passed an ex-parte order which reads thus: “Now on the 3rd day of February, 2020, this matter comes before the Court, and the Court, being well and sufficiently advised finds and orders as follows: 1. The Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter and venue is proper herein. 2. Defendant has removed the parties' minor child to India and remained there without the consent of 3. Defendant has alienated the child from Plaintiff, which is harmful to the child's well-being. 4. Plaintiff is awarded primary care, custody and control of the minor child, Aaditya Kiran pending further orders of the Court. 5. Defendant shall return Aaditya Kiran to Plaintiff immediately. request by either party.” 25.   Firstly, we will deal with the legal submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellants. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants has placed heavy reliance on the decisions of this Court in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra) which are rendered by Benches of three Judges of this Court. With some emphasis, the learned counsel appearing for the appellants had submitted that there is a need to make a departure from the rule of “best interest of the child” or the “welfare principle”.  Her contention is that welfare would mean balancing the interests of all the members of the child’s family. She contended that the mother as the primary caregiver must be kept in mind as a person who has legal rights which must be respected and protected. The learned counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India8 by contending that principles of autonomy must inure against non-state persons as well.      Her submission is that the law regarding custody does not and cannot completely eliminate a woman in the name of child welfare. On this aspect, we must note that in the case of Kanika (supra), this Court has quoted with approval what is held in paragraph 53 of its decision in the case of Prateek Gupta (supra). In paragraph 53 of the decision in the case of Prateek Gupta (supra), it was held that the issue with regard to repatriation of a child has to be addressed not on a consideration of legal rights of the parties but on the sole criteria of the welfare of the child. In paragraph no.34 of its decision, this Court in the case of Kanika (supra), “34. As expounded in the recent decisions of this Court, the issue ought not to be decided on the basis of rights of the parties claiming custody of the minor child but the focus should constantly remain on whether the factum of best interest of the minor child is to return to the native country or otherwise. The fact that the minor child will have better prospects upon return to his/her native country, may be a relevant aspect in a substantive proceeding for grant of custody of the minor child but not decisive to examine the threshold issues in a habeas corpus petition. For the purpose of habeas corpus petition, the Court ought to focus on the obtaining circumstances of the minor child having been removed from the native country and taken to a place to encounter alien environment, language, custom, etc. interfering with his/her overall growth and grooming and whether continuance there will be harmful. This has been the consistent view of this Court as restated in the recent three-Judge Bench decision in Nithya Anand Raghavan [Nithya Anand Raghavan v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2017) 8 SCC 454 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 104] , and the two-Judge Bench decision in Prateek Gupta [Prateek Gupta v. Shilpi is unnecessary to multiply other decisions on the same aspect.” 26.    The learned counsel appearing for the appellant heavily relied upon an article by Mr.John Ekelaar. The article contains some criticism of “the welfare principle”. The author has strongly advocated how the law should be reformulated by getting rid of “welfare” or “best interest” principles. The article is in the realm of the opinion of the learned author. The decision of this Court in the case of Kanika (supra) reiterates the well-settled law that the issue regarding custody of a minor child and the issue of the repatriation of the child to the native country has to be addressed on the sole criteria of the welfare of the minor and not on consideration of the legal rights of the parents.    The principle that the welfare of the minor shall be the predominant consideration and that the rights of the parties to a custody dispute are irrelevant has been consistently followed by this Court. In fact, in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (for short “the 1956 Act”), it is provided that in appointment or declaration of guardian of a minor, the welfare of the minor shall be the paramount consideration.       When a Court decides that it is in the best interest of the minor to remain in the custody of one of the parents, the rights of the other parent are bound to be affected. As provided in clause (a) of Section 6 of the 1956 Act, in the case of a minor boy or girl, the natural guardian is the father, but ordinarily, the custody of a minor who has not completed the age of 5 years shall be with the mother. On a conjoint reading of sub-section (1) of Section 13 read with clause (a) of Section 6 of the 1959 Act, if it is found that the welfare of a minor whose age is more than 5 years requires that his custody should be with the mother, the Court is bound to do so. In the same way, if interest of the minor which is the paramount consideration requires that the custody of a minor child should not be with the mother, the Court will be justified in disturbing the custody of the mother even if the age of the minor is less than five years. In such cases, the rights of the father or the mother, as the case may be, conferred by clause (a) of Section 6 are bound to be affected. Whenever the Court disturbs the custody of one parent, unless there are compelling reasons, the Court will normally provide for visitation rights to the other parent. The reason is that the child needs the company of both parents. The orders for visitation rights are essentially passed for the welfare of minors and for the protection of their right of having the company of both parents. Such orders are not passed only for protecting the rights of the parents.    In view of the settled legal position, the welfare of the minor being the paramount consideration, we cannot act upon the suggestions of Mr.John Ekelaar in his Article. We cannot accept the submission that while applying the welfare principle, the rights of the mother or father need to be protected. The consideration of the well-being and welfare of the child must get precedence over the individual or personal rights of the parents. Whether the Court while dealing with a case like this can compel one of the parents to move from one country to another is a separate issue. We are dealing with the said issue separately. 27.    Each case has to be decided on its own facts and circumstances. Though no hard and fast rule can be laid down, in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra), this Court has laid down the parameters for exercise of the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus under Article 226 of the Constitution of India dealing with cases of minors brought to India from the country of their native. This Court has reiterated that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the minor child and the rights of the parties litigating over the custody issue are irrelevant. After laying down the principles, in the case of Nithya (supra), this Court has clarified that the decision of the Court in each case must depend on the totality of facts and circumstances of the case brought before it.       The factual aspects are required to be tested on the touchstone of the principle of welfare of the minor child.     In the cases of Lahiri (supra) and Yashita (supra), the Benches of this Court consisting of two Judges have not made a departure from the law laid down in the decisions of larger Benches of this Court in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra). The Benches have applied the law laid down by the larger Bench to the facts of the cases before them. It is not necessary for us to discuss in detail the facts of the aforesaid cases. By its very nature, in a custody case, the facts cannot be similar. What is in the welfare of the child depends on several factors. A custody dispute involves human issues which are always complex and complicated. There can never be a straight jacket formula to decide the issue of custody of a minor child as what is in the paramount interest of a minor is always a question of fact. But the parameters for exercise of jurisdiction as laid down in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) will have to be followed. 28.   Now we turn to the findings recorded by the High Court. The perusal of the impugned judgment shows that the High Court has adverted to the law laid down in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra) apart from other cases. The High Court found that in the facts of the case, summary inquiry deserves to be adopted. The Court noted that the child has spent more than three years in USA and two and a half years in India. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is a complete integration of the child with the social, physical, psychological, cultural and academic environment of either USA or India. After considering the documents placed on record, the High Court found that the appellant no.1 has not produced any further medical report or medical treatment record to show that the minor child requires further regular medical treatment apart from usual periodical review and therefore, it will not be difficult to arrange a periodical review even if the child is in USA. The High Court on examination of the documents found that the respondent no.1 had financial resources to maintain the appellant no.1 and the minor child in USA. Merely because the respondent no.1 had asked the appellant no.1 to arrange funds for purchase of lands in Bangalore, it cannot be said that his intention is to abandon USA and settle down permanently in India.          Moreover, the High Court noted that international travel consent signed by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 required that the minor should come back to USA on 26 th September, 2019. The High Court held that change in the travel plan was not discussed and consented by both the parties. The High Court also considered the allegation that the respondent no.1 has temperamental issues. In fact, the respondent no.1 produced a Psychological Evaluation Report dated 21st October 2020 issued by the Centre for Psychology which recorded that the respondent no.1 is free of any neurophysiological problems and has no diagnosable mental health problems. The certificate recorded that he is free of depression, anxiety and reports no suicidal tendencies. The High Court also considered the relevance of the report of the USA Embassy regarding the welfare of the child. The Court noted that there is a disclaimer in the said report that the consular officer who is the author of the report is not trained in child protection, social work, or other similar discipline and therefore, the report is not a child custody evaluation. The High Court has also noted the allegations and rival allegations against each other made by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1. About the argument that the appellant no.1 is taking constant care of the minor child, the High Court referred to the said report of the USA Embassy.        In paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Judgment, the High Court has noted the contents of the said report and has drawn conclusions which are recorded in paragraph 50. Paragraphs 48 to 50 of the impugned Judgment read “48. However, a perusal of the welfare report dated 17.12.2019 of Visiting Consular of US Embassy shows that respondent No.2 told the Visiting Consular that her aunt picks up minor child from school and brings him home each day and stays with him throughout the day while the mother and grand-parents are at work. The minor child has a domestic helper who takes care of his needs and plays with him. It is evident from the report that even respondent No.2 and her parents are not giving whole day personal care and attention to the minor child. 49. The petitioner has filed affidavit dated 15.06.2020 that the petitioner also has requisite skills to care for his child in the USA. The petitioner has also the option to work from home permanently, enabling him to care for the child full time when required. Hanumantharayya has a valid US visa till 23.02.2024 and has expressed her willingness to take care of the minor child to this Court. 50. In these facts and circumstances, there is no reasonable ground to believe that the minor child cannot be given due personal care and attention in USA and therefore, repatriation of the minor child cannot be declined on the ground of lack of requisite personal care and attention to the minor child in USA.” 29.    After considering the said aspects, the High Court issued directions in paragraphs 55, 57 and 58 which we have already quoted above. The factors considered by the High Court were certainly relevant. The High Court had the benefit of the assistance of a learned Counsel who was appointed as Amicus Curiae. He interacted with the contesting parties. The report of the Amicus Curiae has been considered by the High Court. 30.    The learned Judge of the High Court noted that except for the case filed by the respondent no.1 in USA Court regarding custody of the minor, there are no proceedings pending between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1.     It was also noted that the welfare report dated 17 th December, 2019 of Visiting Consular of US Embassy records that the appellant no.1 informed that her aunt picks up the minor child from school and brings him home each day and stays with him throughout the day while the mother and grand-parents are at work. Moreover, a domestic helper is taking care of the needs of the child. Therefore, the appellant no.1 is not devoting her whole day to take personal care of the minor and to attend to the needs of the minor child. The High Court noted that on the other hand, an affidavit has been filed by the respondent no.1 that an option to permanently work from home is available to him and his mother has a valid visa to stay in USA till 23rd February 2024 who has expressed willingness to take care of the minor child in USA. The other factors considered by the High Court while holding a summary inquiry were that the stay of the minor child in India has been for too short a period to facilitate his integration into the social, physical, physiological, cultural and academic environment of India. Moreover, the minor child, if repatriated to USA, will not be subjected to an entirely foreign system of education. The High Court has also taken into consideration the fact that the child is a citizen of USA who will have better future prospects on return to USA. It is observed that the natural process of grooming in the environment of the native country is indispensable for his comprehensive development. The High Court further observed that it is not shown that return of the child to USA will be harmful to him. 31.    After having perused the material on record, we find that the High Court has considered all relevant factors while holding a summary inquiry. The High Court has given reasons for coming to the conclusion that it will be in the interest and welfare of the child to return to USA. The High Court has not treated the order of USA court as conclusive. The High Court had the benefit of the assistance of a learned Counsel who was appointed as amicus. The exercise of power by the High Court cannot be said to be perverse or illegal. We find that the High Court has not overlooked the view taken by larger Benches of this Court in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra). We are in agreement with High Court when it came to the conclusion that it will be in the welfare of the child to return to USA. 32.   The emphasis of the learned counsel appearing for appellants was more on the rights of the appellant no.1 and on making a departure from the well-known concept that the welfare of the minor is the paramount consideration. The said submissions are contrary to the law laid down by this Court in the case of Kanika (supra) as observed by us earlier. As we have noted earlier, the rights of the parents are irrelevant when a Court decides the custody issue. It is not a consideration at all for deciding the 33.   A question was raised whether the High Court was justified in passing an order directing the appellant no.1 to return to USA along with the minor child on or before a particular date.       The issue of custody of a minor, whether in a petition seeking habeas corpus or in a custody petition, has to be decided on the touchstone of the principle that the welfare of a minor is of paramount consideration. The Courts, in such proceedings, cannot decide where the parents should reside as it will affect the right to privacy of the parents. We may note here that a writ Court while dealing with the issue of habeas corpus cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child. If such orders are passed against the wishes of a parent, it will offend her/his right to privacy. A parent has to be given an option to go abroad with the child. It ultimately depends on the parent concerned to decide and opt for giving a company to the minor child for the sake of the welfare of the child. It will all depend on the priorities of the concerned parent. In this case, on a conjoint reading of clauses (i) to (iii) of paragraph 55 of the judgment, it is apparent that such an option has been given to the appellant no.1. 34.   We may record here that an email dated 18 th October, 2021 addressed by the appellant no.1 to the respondent no.1 is placed on record along with I.A. No. 147418 of 2021. In the said email, the appellant no.1 has informed the respondent no.1 that during her visa interview, if she is asked, she will clearly state that the intended purpose of visiting USA was also to contest cases filed by the respondent no.1 and to file cases against the respondent no.1. Therefore, an option has to be given to the appellant no.1 to return to USA along with the minor son though she cannot be forced to stay with the respondent no.1. Therefore, the respondent no.1 will have to make proper arrangements for a suitable residence for the comfortable stay of the appellant no.1 in USA. The reason is that the appellant no.1 cannot work in USA on the basis of a B-2 visa. The respondent no.1 will have to provide a reasonable amount per month to the appellant no.1 to maintain herself and the child in USA. Necessary steps will have to be taken by the respondent no.1 to secure admission for the child in a school in USA. To enable the appellant no.1 to contest the custody petition filed by the respondent no.1, a direction will have to be issued to the respondent no.1 not to enforce and act upon the said order of USA Court in any manner for a period of three months from the date on which the appellant no.1 reaches USA with the son. During the said period of three months, visitation rights will have to be provided to the respondent no.1 to meet the minor child. If the appellant no.1 opts to go to USA and contest the custody proceedings, the parties will have to abide by the result of the said proceedings in so far as the issue of the custody of the minor child is 35.    The appellant no.1 will have to be given time of fifteen days from today to communicate the respondent no.1 her willingness to travel to USA with the child. If she intends to visit USA, along with her willingness, she must communicate possible dates of travel. The dates should be within maximum period of three months from today. On receiving the same, the respondent no.1 shall arrange for air tickets and make arrangements for the comfortable stay of the appellant no.1 and the minor in USA. The respondent no.1 shall, for the time being, transfer US$ 5,000 to the appellant no.1 for facilitating expenditure in USA. The respondent no.1, in addition, shall transfer US$ 1,500 to the appellant no.1 which can be used by the appellant no.1 for the benefit of the minor child in USA. The respondent no.1 will have to also provide a proper health insurance to both of them. The respondent no.1 will also be under an obligation to take care of medical treatment of the minor son. 36.   In the event the appellant no.1 fails to communicate her willingness to travel to USA within fifteen days from today, it will be open for the respondent no.1 to take the custody of the child. After the respondent no.1 arrives in India, the appellant no.1 shall hand over the custody of the minor son to the respondent no.1 to enable the respondent no.1 to take the minor son to USA. To the above extent, the order of the High Court requires modification.    As noted earlier, now B-2 visa has been granted to the appellant no.1. The respondent no.1 will have to also facilitate extension of visa granted to the appellant no.1, in case she desires to continue her stay (i)    It will be open for the appellant no.1 to travel to USA along with the minor child and to contest the proceedings pending in USA. If the appellant no.1 is willing to travel to USA along with the minor child, she will communicate her willingness to do so to the respondent no.1 by email within a period of fifteen days from today. The appellant no.1 shall communicate to the respondent no.1 the possible dates on which she proposes to travel along with the minor child. The possible dates shall be within three months from today; (ii)   On receiving an intimation as aforesaid, the respondent no.1 shall book air tickets after consulting the appellant no.1. The respondent no.1 shall make proper arrangements for separate stay of the appellant no.1 in USA after consulting her. The arrangements for residence shall be made at the cost of the respondent no.1. As and when the appellant no.1 wants to return to India, it shall be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay for her air tickets. If she wishes to continue in USA, the respondent no.1 shall take all possible steps for the (iii) In the event the appellant no.1 agrees to travel to USA along with the minor son, it will be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay a sufficient amount per month to the appellant no.1 for maintenance of herself and the minor son. Along with the air tickets, the respondent no.1 shall remit US$ 6,500 to the appellant no.1 by a mutually convenient mode. The amount shall be utilised by the appellant no.1 to meet initial expenditure in USA. After the expiry of period of one month from the date on which the appellant no.1 arrives in USA, the respondent no.1 shall regularly remit a mutually agreed amount to the appellant no.1 for maintenance. If there be any dispute, the parties are free to adopt remedy in accordance with law. The respondent no.1 shall provide proper medical insurance to the appellant no.1 and the minor child while they are in USA. Moreover, the respondent no.1 shall be under an obligation to provide proper medical treatment to the minor child; (iv)   In the event, the appellant no.1 along with the minor child visits USA in terms of this order, for a period of three months from the date of her arrival, the respondent no.1 shall not take any steps to implement or enforce the order dated 3 rd February 2020 passed by the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas which will enable the appellant no.1 to move the concerned Court for contesting the petition filed by the respondent no.1 and to file appropriate proceedings. A written undertaking to that effect shall be filed by the respondent no.1 in this Court within two weeks from today. Thus, for the said period of three months, the custody of the minor shall remain with the appellant (v)       After the appellant no.1 and minor child reach USA, subject to the orders which may be passed by the competent Court in USA, for a period of 3 months from their arrival, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to have temporary custody of the minor child from 10 am to 5 pm on every Sunday or as mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1. In addition, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to make a video call to talk to the minor child for about half an hour on every day (except Sunday) between 5 pm to 6 pm; (vi)   In the event, the appellant no.1 is not willing to visit USA along with her minor son and fails to communicate her willingness to visit USA within a period of fifteen days from today, it will be open for the respondent no.1 to take custody of the child. After the respondent no.1 visits India, the appellant no.1 shall hand over the custody of the minor child to him and the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to take the minor child with him to USA.       In such an event, the appellant no.1 will be entitled to talk to the minor child on video call for half an hour on every day between 5 pm to 6 pm (USA time) or at such time as mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the (vii) As observed by the High Court in paragraph 58 of the impugned Judgment, an option of adopting agreed joint parenting plan remains open to the parties. If they wish to do so, they can always file appropriate application before the High (viii) This order shall not be construed to mean that any final adjudication has been made on the rights of the parties. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
The biological parents, i.e. appellant Nos.3 and 4 and alleged adoptive parents, i.e. appellant Nos.1 and 2 entered into unregistered agreement of an 'unborn child' in the form of adoption, jointly filed the present appeal against the judgment and decree dated 31-5-2022 passed in G & W.C. No.9 of 2021 MFA No. 4617 of 2022 on the file of the Additional Senior Civil Judge, Udupi, dismissing the petition filed under Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (for short, 'the Act'). I.  Facts of the case 2.   Appellant Nos.1 and 2 filed the petition before the trial Court under the provisions of Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of the G & W Act to grant permission to appoint them as the adoptive parents and guardians of a minor child, by name Inshu. Appellants Nos.3 and 4 are the biological parents of the said child. The child was born on 26-3-2020. Since appellant Nos.1 and 2 were childless and appellant Nos.3 and 4 were unable to look after the child due to poverty, appellant Nos.1 and 2 adopted the child. After adoption of the child, appellant Nos.1 and 2 have looked after raised the child for two years as their own daughter with love and affection.    The respondent- State represented by Legal-cum-Probation Officer, District Child Protection Unit, Udupi, lodged a complaint against appellant Nos.3 and 4 stating that they have illegally sold the child to appellant Nos.1 and 2. However, the only mistake committed by appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, and appellant MFA No. 4617 of 2022 Nos.1 and 2, adoptive parents, is that due to lack of proper legal knowledge and guidance, the procedure was not complied with.   Now, the child is in the custody of the respondents/ appellants 3 & 4. Therefore, appellant Nos.1 and 2 are seeking to appoint them as adoptive parents of the child. 3.  The order-sheet of the trial Court dated 25-11-2021 depicts that appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, came up with their vakalatnama and also filed memo to the effect that they have no objection for the petition filed by appellant Nos.1 and 2, adoptive parents. 4. In order to prove the case of appellant Nos.1 and 2, appellant No.1 examined herself as P.W.1 and marked four documents as per Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.4(a).          No evidence was adduced on behalf of appellant Nos.3 and 4, who are respondent Nos.1 and 2 before the trial Court. 5. Learned Judge of the trial Court upon careful perusal of the pleadings has framed the following issue: MFA No. 4617 of 2022 "Whether the petitioners are entitled for permission to     appoint   them   as   adoptive  parents   and guardian    of  the   person   of  minor   Inshu  as contemplated under Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, as prayed for them in their petition?" 6. After considering the oral and documentary evidence on record, the learned trial Judge, by judgment and decree dated 31-5-2022 dismissed the petition.      Hence, the present appeal is filed. 7. We have heard Smt. Haleema Ameen, learned counsel for the appellants, Sri Vijayakumar A. Patil, learned Additional Government Advocate, along with Sri Kiran Kumar, learned High Court Government Pleader, for the respondent-State. 8. On 23-11-2022, this Court requested Sri Vijayakumar A. Patil, learned Additional Government Advocate, along with Sri Kiran Kumar, learned High Court Government Pleader, to assist the Court with reference to the Rules made by the State Government under Section 35 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. II.  Arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants 9. Learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the impugned judgment and decree passed by the trial Court dismissing the petition filed by appellant Nos.1 and 2 to appoint them as adoptive parents and guardians is erroneous and the same cannot be sustained and is liable to be set aside. She has further contended that the trial Court failed in appreciating the sanctity of the fact that the adoptive parents of the child and the biological parents had entered into an agreement with respect of adopting the child in question even before the child was born on 26-3-2020 and hence, the question of having sold the child does not arise. 10.   The learned counsel has further contended that filing of F.I.R. and taking the child into their custody by the respondent is only for their statistical purpose and not in the interest of welfare of the child.    Further, the child who was under the love and care of appellant Nos.1 and 2 is kept under the shelter of persons unknown to the child and this aspect will have grave repercussions on the psychological growth of the MFA No. 4617 of 2022 child.  She has further contended that Section 17 of the Act emphasizes on the aspect that welfare of the minor child alone shall be considered while granting custody.     She has further contended that the petition filed by the adoptive parents is dismissed only on the ground that the biological parents belonging to Hindu and leanred      trial court has not stated anything in respect of applicability of Hindu Adoption and 11.   The further contended that the Apex Court and several High Courts have held that conversion to different faith cannot be regarded as a disqualification for custody of the minor child.  Therefore, she sought to allow the appeal. III.   Arguments advanced by the learned Additional Government Advocate for the respondent 12.   Per contra, Sri Vijayakumar A. Patil, learned Additional Government Advocate, along with Sri Kiran Kumar, learned High Court Government Pleader, while justifying the impugned judgment and decree passed by the trial Court, has contended that at the first instance, the agreement was not registered one. The appellants cannot have any agreement to MFA No. 4617 of 2022 an unborn child and it is unknown to law.         Appellant Nos.1 and 2 belong to Muslim community and appellant Nos.3 and 4 belong to Hindu community and thereby, Mohammedan Law does not recognise adoption. He has further contended that it is the duty of the Court to consider the welfare of the child, if really appellant Nos.3 and 4, are being biological parents, were unable to take care of the child.      Very strangely, appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, have filed memo through their counsel stating that they have no objection to the petition filed by appellant Nos.1 and 2, which raises the doubt of adoption and thereby, the 3rd respondent was justified in lodging the complaint before the jurisdictional Police that the child has been 13. He has further contended that sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Act provides that 'in considering what will be for the welfare of the minor, the Court shall have regard to the age, sex and religion of the minor, the character and capacity of the proposed guardian and his nearness of kin to the minor, the wishes, if any, of a deceased parent, and any existing or previous relations of the proposed guardian with the minor or MFA No. 4617 of 2022 his property'.     Admittedly, the appellant Nos.3 & 4 are the biological parents being Hindus and appellant Nos.1 & 2 are the adoptive parents being Muslims,          have entered into an unregistered agreement (Ex.P.1) of an unborn child in the form of adoption which creates a doubt.       Therefore, he sought to dismiss the appeal. 14.   In view of the aforesaid rival contentions, the only point that would arise for our consideration in the appeal is: Whether appellant Nos.1 and 2, adoptive parents, and appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, have made out a case to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court? 15.    We have given our anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perused the entire material on record carefully. 16.    It is undisputed fact that appellant Nos.1 and 2 belong to Muslim community and appellant Nos.3 and 4 belong to Hindu community.      It is the case of appellant Nos.1 and 2 MFA No. 4617 of 2022 that on 21-3-2020, they have entered into agreement with appellant Nos.3 and 4 that post delivery of the child, they will take care of the child and raise the child. In order to verify the veracity, we have perused the agreement entered between them. In the agreement for adoption dated 21-3-2020, it is mentioned that the first party, i.e. appellant Nos.1 and 2 have adopted the child of the second party, i.e. appellant Nos.3 and 4 and they will raise the child with honour and dignity.    As on the date of the agreement, the child was in the womb of appellant No.4 and the child was born on 26-3-2020, i.e. after five days of the agreement entered into between the parties. Thereby, both parties entered into agreement in respect of an "unborn child, which is unknown to law". Condition No.3 in the agreement is that, the second party will not claim any money from the first party. Thereby, this clearly depicts that the child was given in adoption for money. It is also relevant to point out at this stage that on the basis of the complaint lodged by the 3rd respondent, Kota Police registered a case against the appellants and two others, namely Balakrishna and Reshma, in Crime No.104 of 2021 for the offences punishable under Sections 80, 81 and 87 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and MFA No. 4617 of 2022 Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Later, it was transferred to Karkala Town Police Station and the same was numbered as Crime No.72 of 2021 for the offences punishable under Sections 80 and 81 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and under Sections 465, 468 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The jurisdictional Police, after holding detailed enquiry, filed charge-sheet on 14-6-2022 before the Principal Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First 17.   A careful perusal of the agreement entered into between the parties clearly depicts that appellant Nos.1 and 2 belong to Muslim community and appellant Nos.3 and 4 belong to Hindu community and thereby, the Mohammedan Law does not recognise adoption.    Our view is fortified by the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of DAGADABAI (DEAD) BY LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES v. ABBAS ALIAS GULAB RUSTUM PINJARI reported in (2017) 13 SCC 705, wherein at paragraph No.20, it has held as under: "20.   Fifth, the defendant having failed to prove that he was the adopted son of Rustum, had no MFA No. 4617 of 2022 option but to suffer the decree of dispossession from the suit land. It is a settled principle of Mohammedan Law that Mohammedan Law does not recognize    adoption   (see-Section   347    of  Mulla Principles of Mahomedan Law, 20th Edition page 18.   It is shocking that an agreement is entered into between the parties in respect of an "unborn child".       It is for the District Child Protection Unit to take the responsibility of all such cases. It is well settled that 'an unborn child has a life of its own and rights of its own and the rights of unborn are recognised by law. No doubt, only if the unborn can be treated as a person, the right to life of the unborn can be equated with the fundamental right of the mother guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. True, an unborn is not a natural person, but it is well known that after six weeks, life is infused into the embryo, thus converting embryo into foetus and once an embryo evolves into a foetus, the heartbeat starts. In other words, the unborn has life from the stage it transforms into foetus. If the unborn has life, though it is not a natural person, it can certainly be considered as a person within the meaning of MFA No. 4617 of 2022 Article 21 of the Constitution, for there is absolutely no reason to treat an unborn child differently from a born child. In other words, the right to life of an unborn shall also be considered as one falling within the scope of Article 21 of the Constitution of India'.   Admittedly, in the present case, as on the date of agreement, i.e. on 21-3-2020, appellant No.4 was nine months pregnant and she delivered the child on 26-3-2020, i.e. after five days of the agreement, thereby the child has a every right to lead life with dignity and honour as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 19. Based on the agreement, appellant Nos.3 and 4 filed the petition before the trial Court for custody.     In all cases, where a Court is called upon to adjudicate the question as to whether permission shall be granted to a pregnant woman for terminating her pregnancy on a plea of infringement of her fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Court has to make a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn.       The fact remains that as on the date of agreement entered into between the parties, appellant No.4 was in verge of completing nine MFA No. 4617 of 2022 months of her pregnancy and thereby, the appellants, both adoptive parents and biological parents, have violated the rights of the child guaranteed under the provisions of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, very agreement for adoption on 21- 3-2020 entered between the parties is invalid document and the   same    is   not  permissible   under   the   principles  of Mohammedan        Law.    As   already   stated  supra,   the  3rd respondent rightly lodged the complaint to the jurisdictional Police and in turn, they registered a case and now it is pending on the file of the Principal Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class, Karkala. Thereby, we resist to observe anything at this stage that it is for the concerned Court to proceed to a logical end in accordance with law. 20. The leaned trial Judge, while considering Ex.P.1 has recorded a finding that agreement for adoption does not depicts the welfare of the minor child, and rightly dismissed the petition in accordance with law. It is relevant to observe at this stage that, if really appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, came forward to give the child for adoption due to poverty, MFA No. 4617 of 2022 they could have surrendered the child to the concerned authority for the welfare of the child.   Even if that was not possible, they could have taken care by sending the child to Government Educational institutions and now, the Government has introduced various schemes for their day-to-day essential commodities, thereby the contention of the learned counsel for appellants that appellant Nos.3 and 4 entered into agreement for adoption of their child to appellant Nos.1 and 2 due to poverty cannot be accepted. The Government has introduced many schemes to overcome, or to streamline the poverty. If they have self-confidence and respect, they can lead family by taking loan from Banks and instead of that, appellant Nos.3 and 4 have sold the child in the name of adoption, which cannot be 21. Even under Section 35 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, provides that (1)       a parent or guardian, who for physical, emotional and social factors beyond their control, wishes to surrender a child, shall produce the child before the Committee; (2) if, after prescribed process of inquiry and counseling, the Committee is satisfied, a MFA No. 4617 of 2022 surrender deed shall be executed by the parent or guardian, as the case may be, before the Committee, and (3) the parents or guardian who surrendered the child, shall be given two months time to reconsider their decision and in the intervening period, the Committee shall either allow, after due inquiry, the child to be with the parents or guardian under supervision, or place the child in a Specialised Adoption Agency, if he or she is below six years of age, or a children's home if he is above six years. 22.  When the State Government is providing so many benefits for the welfare of the Society, that too, for the people below the poverty and Section 35 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and    Protection  of  Children)    Act, 2015,  clearly  explains regarding surrender of the child, the agreement entered into between appellant Nos.1 and 2 and appellant Nos.3 and 4 cannot be sustained. 23.   Admittedly, from 20-5-2021, the child is in the welfare custody of Krishna Anugraha Centre, Udupi, and it is the recognised Centre of the State Government for welfare of the child.    When we summoned the appellants before this MFA No. 4617 of 2022 Court, appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, expressed their willingness to take back their child along with them. If it is so, it is for them to approach the Child Welfare Committee and the Child Welfare Committee to take appropriate steps in accordance with law. 24. For the reasons stated above, the point raised in the present appeal is answered in the negative holding that the appellants have not made out a case to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court. 25. In view of the above, we pass the following i.      The appeal, being devoid of merits, is hereby ii.      The judgment and decree dated 31-5-2022 passed in G & W.C. No.9 of 2021 on the file of the Additional Senior Civil Judge, Udupi, is hereby MFA No. 4617 of 2022 iii.     It is needless to observe that appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, to approach the Child Welfare Committee, if they really want their child back and it is for the Child Welfare Committee to take appropriate steps and pass orders in accordance iv.      If the Child Welfare Committee comes to the conclusion that after considering all the pros and cons in handing over the child to appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, then the jurisdictional Police is directed to monitor appellant Nos.3 and 4 and so that the child is not sold to anyone and ensure that A3 and A4 shall        take care of the paramount interest of the child. The assistance rendered by Sri Vijayakumar A. Patil, along with Sri Kiran Kumar, learned High Court Government Pleader,   Smt.    Haleema   Ameen,    learned  counsel  for  the appellants, Sri M.V. Chadrakanth, IPS, Director, Directorate of MFA No. 4617 of 2022 Officer, and Sri Damodara K.B., Sub-Inspector of Police, are highly appreciated and placed on record.
         S/O LATE FAIZUDDIN, R/O VILL- JORGARH, P.S.-TEZPUR, PIN-784001, DIST-          REPRESENTED BY THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA,          MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS, NEW DELHI-110001           REPRESENTED BY THE CHIEF ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA           REPRESENTED BY THE COMMISSIONER AND SECRETARY TO THE           REPRESENTED BY THE STATE COORDINATOR ACHYUT PLAZA Advocate for the Respondent : ASSTT.S.G.I.       Heard Mr. A. Paul, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Ms. L. Devi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Mr. R.K. Dev Choudhury, learned Asstt. SGI for respondent no.1 & 4 and ; Ms. A. Verma, learned Special Standing Counsel, F.T. appearing for respondent nos.6 & 7; Mr. A. Bhuyan, learned Standing Counsel, ECI, appearing for respondent no.2 and Ms. U. Das, learned Government Advocate, Assam, appearing for respondent nos.3 & 5. 2.      Considering the nature of the case, we are of the opinion that the present petition can be disposed of at the motion stage itself without issuing any formal notice to the respondents. 3.      The present petition has been filed by the petitioner, namely, Md. Maynul @ Moinul Hoque @ Md. Moinul, son of late Faizuddin, resident of village Jorgarh under P.S.:Tezpur, Dist.:Sonitpur, Assam on being aggrieved by the impugned ex parate order dated 31.12.2020 passed by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1, Assam, in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012, declaring the petitioner to be a foreigner of post 1971 stream. 4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that earlier in another proceeding i.e. in F.T. (D) Case No.8312/2012, the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur 1 st, Sonitpur by order dated 31.08.2017 had held that the petitioner, namely, Md. Moinul @ Moinul Hoque, son of Late Foizuddin (Abdul Hussain), resident of village Jorgarh under P.S.Tezpur, Dist. Sonitpur, Assam had been able to discharge his onus to prove that he is not a foreigner but an Indian. Accordingly, the reference was answered in negative against the State and in favour of the petitioner/proceedee. However, the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur No.1, Assam in the subsequent proceeding i.e. in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 took a view that the proceedee neither submitted his representation nor adduced his evidence in support of his claim that he is an Indian Citizen and accordingly, failed to prove that he is an Indian citizen. 5.       The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that though the petitioner had appeared before the Tribunal after receiving the notice, the reason for the petitioner’s inability to appear before the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1 on several occasions was because of ongoing COVID pandemic and as such, it has been submitted that the said ex parte order dated 31.12.2020 may be set aside by remanding the matter to the Foreigners Tribunal, more particularly, in the light of the earlier opinion referred by the same Tribunal on 31.08.2017 in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012. 6.     According to the learned counsel for the petitioner since there is a similarity in the names and particulars of the proceedee in both the proceedings, the second proceeding in respect of F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 before the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1 st), Assam could not be sustainable in terms of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court passed in Abdul Kuddus vs Union of India (2019) 6 SCC 604, as the proceeding before the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1st), Assam in respect of F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 is quasi judicial and the principle of res judicata will be applicable in this proceeding. 7. It has been clearly mentioned in Abdul Kuddus (supra) that if there had been an order by the Foreigners Tribunal in favour of a person determining the citizenship, the said decision will be binding on subsequent proceedings against the same person and there cannot be another proceeding to re-determine the citizenship of the person, by applying the principle of res 8.       In the present case, since this aspect could not be considered by the Foreigners Tribunal as it was decided ex parte, we are also of the view that the matter requires to be decided afresh by the Tribunal keeping in mind the earlier opinion dated 31.08.2017 in the light of the decision in Abdul Kuddus (supra).     Only when the Tribunal comes to a finding that the present proceedee is not the same person who was proceeded and was found to be an Indian in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012, the impugned order will be revived and the order of the Tribunal can be challenged by the petitioner both on the issue of identity of the petitioner and other grounds raised in this 9.    In view of above, without entering in the merit of the case we remand the matter to the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur, Assam by setting aside the impugned order 31.12.2020 passed by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1, Assam, in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 to examine whether the petitioner is the same person who was proceded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur 1 st, Sonitpur. The Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur No.1, Sonitpur shall decide first as to whether the petitioner is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 or not, for which the petitioner shall appear before the Foreigners Tribunal on 14.02.2022 to enable the Tribunal to examine that he is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 . 10.       Accordingly, this shall be the preliminary issue which is to be decided by the Foreigners Tribunal 1st Tezpur, in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 as to whether the present proceedee is the same person who was earlier declared an Indian Citizen in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 by the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur (1 st), Sonitpur and if it is found that the petitioner is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 by the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur, the present proceeding shall immediately be concluded in favour of the petitioner on the basis of the order passed in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 on 31.08.2017 where the petitioner was declared an Indian citizen.       If, however, the decision is otherwise, the petitioner will be at liberty to challenge this opinion as well as the other findings by approaching this Court again. 11.    It is made clear that since the nationality of the petitioner is already under cloud, he will remain on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 5,000/- (Rupees five thousand) with one local surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Police (Border), Sonitpur during the pendency of the proceeding before the Tribunal. The concerned Superintendent of Police (Border) shall also take steps for capturing the fingerprints and biometrics of the iris of the petitioner. The petitioner also shall not leave the jurisdiction of Sonitpur district without furnishing the details of the place of destination and necessary information including contact number to the Superintendent of Police (Border), Sonitpur. 12.    With the above observations and directions, the writ petition stands disposed of. 13.    Copy of this order be furnished to the Superintendent of Police (B), Sonitpur for doing the needful. 
2.   The present case is having history of repeated litigation by land owners to get compensation of the land owned by them. The land owners’    land admeasuring     area of Ac 3.23 guntas in Survey No. 268 of Attapur Village, Rajendranagar Mandal, Ranga Reddy District   was sought to be acquired for the purpose of extension of the Nehru Zoological Park. The Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short “L.A. Act”) and final Notification under Section 6 were issued on 19.03.1981    and   09.04.1981   respectively.     Despite   taking possession,   award   was   not   passed   and    no   amount     of compensation was paid. The land owners had filed Writ Petition No. 17119 of 1996 before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which was disposed     vide order dated 22.04.1997 directing          the respondents (Revenue Department)      to pass an award within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the order. Only thereafter award was passed in case No. 1/1844/89 on 07.06.1997 and a meagre compensation @ Rs. 6 per sq. yard was awarded to the land owners. 3.   The land owners submitted representation asking reference under Section 18 of L.A Act, which was not responded, forcing them to approach again the High Court. The land owners filed Writ Petition No. 5676 of 2003 which was disposed of on 18.04.2003 directing the Land Acquisition Officer to take action to make reference within six weeks. Even after direction by the High Court, reference was not made, however the land owners filed Contempt Case No. 1668 of 2004. After issuing notice in contempt,     reference was made by the Land Acquisition Officer to the Ist Additional Senior Civil Judge, Ranga Reddy District which was registered as O.P. No. 205 of 2005. The Reference Court made the award on 03.09.2012 directing respondents to pay compensation to the land owners @ Rs. 250 per sq. yard with solatium and interest. 4.    The enhancement, as directed by the Reference Court, was questioned by the Revenue Department by filing appeals before the High Court bearing LAAS Nos. 303 of 2013 and 330 of 2015. The land owners had also filed an appeal bearing LAAS No. 353 of 2015 questioning the adequacy of compensation.          The High Court, during the course of hearing, by consent of the parties, referred the appeals for Mediation vide order dated 01.02.2016. The relevant extract of the order is reproduced as under: “In the given circumstances, we are satisfied that if a trained mediator works out, exhibiting the necessary patience, it is more likely that the controversy can be sorted out effectively and to the satisfaction of both sides. In these given facts and circumstances, we consider it appropriate to direct the Registry to refer these appeals for Mediation and Conciliation Centre attached to the High Court with a request to the Deputy Director in charge thereof to refer the dispute in these appeals to one of the trained mediators, if possible, who has handled similar assignments relating to the land acquisition matters in the past ” During the mediation proceedings,         the parties have   entered into Joint Memorandum of Compromise on 28.04.2016, in which the Revenue Department agreed to pay compensation @ Rs. 350/­ per sq. yard.       Accordingly, the Mediator submitted its report on 05.05.2016, inter alia stating that the      proposal made by the land owners of Rs. 500/­ per sq. yard had not been accepted on behalf of the Government, but agreed to fix Rs. 350 per sq. yard towards the        compensation     and determined the total sum as Rs. 3,48,46,578/­. The report of the Mediator is also relevant, therefore reproduced as thus: “As per the claim of the parties quoted @ Rs. 500 /­ per Sq. Yard for total extent of 8,651.5 Sq. Yards including 30% Solatium on market value under Section 23(2) and 12% p.a. Addl. Market Value u/s 23(1) from the date of Notification 03.03.1981 to 07.06.1997 as per Award. The claim from the above after calculation of interest the parties after deduction of the payment made in EP No. 11 of 2013 deposited by the LAO the claim is Rs. After making hectic efforts between the parties and the matter is finalized on 28.04.2016 before me at Mediation Centre proposed to fix the land value @ Rs. 350/­ per Sq. Yard as per the proposal made by the officers to deduct the 20% of the land value, the amount comes to Rs. 3,48,46,578/­ and the parties convinced as full and final settlement subject withdrawal of the cases pending before the Courts” 5.    After submission of Mediation Report, Deputy Collector, Government of Telangana addressed a letter bearing No. 1/4279/1997 dated 7.5.2016 to the Curator, Nehru Zoological Park, Bahadurpura, Hyderabad with a request to pursue the matter with the Government to sanction the fund at the earliest to avoid any other future problem. The relevant extract of said letter is reproduced as thus: “During the course of discussions regarding settlement of land value, the party in person requested to fix the market value@ Rs. 500/­ per Sq. Yard. But after long discussions the Mediator has proposed the land value @ Rs. 350 /­ per Sq. Yard. Via Media and placed before this authority. Finally by considering the prevailing market value of the land agreed the proposal of Mediator and fixed the land value @ Rs. 350/­ per Sq. Yard. Accordingly a Joint Memorandum of Compromise has been filed before the Mediation Centre on 30.04.2016. In compliance to the above the Mediator High Court of, Judicature at Hyderabad has addressed a letter dated. 05.05.2016 to this authority directing to make arrangement to issue cheque in the name of the parties in the LAAS No.353/2015 by name Mr. Ismail Bhai S/o. (Late) Hassan Ali before the Mediator centre on or before 20.05.2016 to settle the issue and submit before the High Court. In view of the above, kindly make it pursue the matter with Government and to provide the fund at the earliest to avoid any other future problems.” 6.   On the basis of the mediation report, relying upon the Joint Memorandum of Compromise executed by the                parties, the appeals filed by the Revenue Department         as well as the land owners were disposed of vide order dated 10.06.2016. The order passed by the High Court is reproduced as thus: “1. The dispute between the parties in the above appeals was referred to the Mediation and Arbitration Centre, by an order of this court dated Arbitration Centre attached to this Court, it appears that the Mediation was successful. The parties have entered into a Joint Memorandum of Compromise before the Mediation and the copy of the Joint Memorandum of Compromise entered into on 28.04.2016 is filed before us. 3. Therefore, both the appeals are disposed of in terms of the Joint Memorandum of Compromise entered into by the parties before the Mediation and Arbitration Centre. There shall be no order as to costs. Pending miscellaneous applications, if any, in these appeals, shall stand closed.” 7.    Even on communication of the said order, which was passed in presence of both the parties, it was not complied with by making the payment of compensation.            Therefore, a Writ Petition bearing No. 34175 of 2016 was filed by the land owners before the High Court seeking direction to the authorities to make payment of agreed compensation of Rs. 3,48,46,578/­ as calculated in Joint Memorandum of Compromise. After service of the notice of the said Writ Petition, the Revenue Department instead of complying the order of the High Court, filed petitions seeking recall of the order dated 10.06.2016 taking exception that the Revenue Divisional Officer, who signed the Joint Memorandum of Compromise,           had not taken permission from the superior officers. The High Court allowed the Recall Petitions bearing LAASMP No. 59 of 2017 in L.A.A.S. No. 303 of 2013 and LAASMP No. 60 of 2017 in L.A.A.S. No. 353 of 2015 and restored LAAS Nos. 303/2013 and 353/2015. 8.    After   restoration,  the   appeal   filed  by  the   Revenue Department was allowed by High Court vide order dated 24.11.2017 reducing the compensation @ Rs. 100 /­per sq. yard in place of Rs. 250/­ per sq. yard as determined by the Reference Court.   Consequently, the appeal filed by the land owners was 9.    Relying on the order dated 24.11.2017 passed in LAAS Nos. 303 of 2013 and 353 of 2015, the High Court vide order dated 19.12.2017 also disposed of LAAS No. 163 of 2016 filed by Fakhruddin Ali (appellant herein), whose land was also acquired in the same impugned Notification. 10.   Challenging the impugned order of the High Court, the present appeals have been filed by the land owners, questioning the adequacy and grant of       compensation with interest.   The Revenue Department has also filed an appeal assailing the impugned     order  on  the   ground   that  the  deductions   for development charge and the area of land used for development have not been made by the High Court. 11.   Learned senior counsel for the land owners submits that a prayer was made before the Reference Court to compute the compensation @ Rs. 1000/­ per sq. yard with solatium @ 30% on the market value as provided under Section 23(2), 12% p.a. additional market value under Section 23(1)A of L.A. Act from the date of notification under Section 4 till the date of award along with statutory interest.       The Reference Court after considering the submissions so made and relying upon the copy of the sale deed (Exb. A­1) i.e. document No.       1208/81, the judgments and decrees of the High Court in two appeals bearing CCCA Nos. 6 of 1987 and 110 of 1987 arising out of the different Original Petitions relating to the land of another village Bahadurpur filed as Exb. A­2 and A­3, topo sketch Ex. A­4, maps of village Attapur and Mir Sagar as Exbs. A­5 and A­6 and D.O. letter dated 28.8.2019 sent by the Revenue Divisional Officer Exb. A­7 and also the statement of the claimant PW1 and the retired Government Surveyor PW2 and also considering the statement of the Land Acquisition Officer RW­1 and Deputy Collector­cum­RDO        examined as      RW­2, determined the compensation @ Rs. 250 per sq. yard enhancing the same from Rs. 6 per sq. yard. It was also held that the land owners would be entitled for solatium @ 30% on the market value, additional market value along with interest @ 12% p.a. and the interest as specified under Section 23(2) of L.A. Act. Before the High Court, the adequacy of the said amount was questioned looking to the surroundings of the land acquired and the market value on the date of acquisition. It was urged during mediation, and as agreed by the Revenue, compensation @ Rs. 350/­ per sq. yard was decided by Joint Memorandum of Compromise             which was accepted by the High Court.      Later, the Revenue Department filed recall petitions only on the ground that for the Joint Memorandum of Compromise, permission from superior officers have not been taken.       The Revenue Department has not questioned the rate as agreed by the Revenue Divisional Officer, but the High Court allowed the Recall Petitions and restored the appeals and by the impugned order,     reduced the compensation to Rs. 100/­ per sq. yard without any basis, applying the reverse 12.   On the other hand, in the appeal filed by Revenue Department, it is urged that out of compensation so awarded, development charges have not been deducted and the area required for development has not been reduced while computing the compensation at the rate so determined by the High Court and prayed that the appeal filed by the Department may be allowed dismissing the appeal filed by the land owners. 13.   After having heard learned senior counsel for the parties and on perusal of the material brought on record, it is apparent that the acquisition of land was made in the year 1981. Indisputably, the land acquired is situated in a highly developed area of the twin cities having amenities of water, electricity, drainage, telephone, transport etc. The only sale deed filed by the claimants Exb. A­1 dated 21.09.1981 of village Bahadurpur which is of adjacent       village because no sale deed of village Attapur in the said year was executed. As per topo sketch Exb. A­4, the distance between the two villages Bahadurpur and Attapur is 1320 meters. The value of the said land as per said sale deed was Rs. 200/­ per sq. yard. Exbs. A2 and A3 are the decrees passed in two cases in which the compensation has been fixed @ Rs. 250/­ per sq. yard of the land acquired at the same time.      The said      documents    find support from the testimony of PW­1 and PW­ 2. The departmental witness RW­2 in his statement admitted that in Katedan Village, an industrial estate   is situated at the distance of 3 ½ k.m.     from Attapur Village. The Agricultural University, National Police Academy is also nearby.     The High Court of Andhra Pradesh         is  also situated within a distance of 3 K.M. from the land acquired. The said land is required for laying the filter beds for Nehru Zoological Park. The evidence as produced by the land owners has not been rebutted by filing any document. On the contrary, the departmental witness has admitted before the Reference Court that the acquired land of the village is a prominent area within the vicinity of the city of Hyderabad. In absence of having any material on record, in our view, the Reference Court rightly relied on Exb. A­1 sale deed of adjacent Village Bahadurpur. The acquired land may have been situated in Village Attapur but it is adjacent to Village Bahadurpur, where the land value was fixed as Rs. 200 per sq. yard.            While granting the compensation of the adjacent piece of land, the Court decided value @ Rs. 250/­ per sq. yard as mentioned in decrees Exbs. A­ 2 & A­3. The D.O. letter of Revenue Development Officer dated 28.8.1991 acknowledges minimum value @ Rs. 200 per sq. yard on the date of acquisition.   It is also relevant to observe that after sending the matter for mediation, Joint Memorandum of Compromise was entered into by the Revenue Divisional Officer, wherein the Mediator fixed the rate @ Rs. 350/­ per sq. yard in place of Rs. 500/­ per sq. yard as agreed by the Revenue Department. In Recall Petitions, the said joint memorandum of compromise was challenged only on the ground            that such compromise was signed without permission of the superior officer without challenging that the value of land as offered is on higher side. Therefore, in our view, the High Court committed an error in computing the compensation @ Rs. 100 per sq. yard ignoring the unrebutted documents produced by the land owners and without any cogent material on record, by applying reverse calculation. In our view, as per the testimony of the departmental witness RW­2, it is clear that the land acquired is near to the Agricultural University, National Police Academy and High Court of A.P., which is now in the heart of the city of Hyderabad.     Considering the aforesaid and, taking note of the date of acquisition i.e. 1981 which is about 40 years ago, the value of the said land cannot be computed at the rate less than Rs. 250/­ per sq. yard which is supported by the evidence brought on record by the land owners. 14.   We now revert to the issue raised in the appeal filed by the Revenue Department on the point of deduction of development charge and the area of the land used for development. Recently in the case of Reddy Veerana vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others 2022 SCC Online 562, the deduction of the development charge was denied.        The facts of the present case is not uncommon to the said case. As discussed above, it is apparent that the land in the present case was acquired 40 years back in the year 1981 and the compensation was decided by LAO after litigating in courts only @ Rs. 6 per sq. yard. The land acquired is now in the heart of city of Hyderabad where the cost of the land has been increased more than 100 times. The development of the city has already taken place.     The land owners, whose land has been utilized 40 years back, now cannot be compelled to pay the development charge for the development which has already taken place, only for a parcel of land to which they have not given compensation up to decades. Therefore, the plea taken by the Revenue Department sans merit. 15.   In view of the foregoing, the appeals filed by the land owners     are allowed and the appeals filed by the Revenue Department are dismissed. The impugned judgment passed by the High Court stands set­aside, restoring the order of the Reference Court. The amount of compensation, as determined by the Reference Court, be calculated and be paid now within a period of two months from the date of this judgment.       In the facts of the case, the parties to bear their own costs.
1.          The present writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India has been preferred by the daughter and the wife of the deceased – Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, seeking transfer of trial arising out of RC- 04(S)/2020/CBI/SC-III/New Delhi from CBI Special Court, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh to the CBI Special Court, Hyderabad or CBI Special Court, New Delhi, and also to direct the CBI for duly completing the investigation in the aforesaid FIR in a time bound manner. 2.     Shri Siddharth Luthra, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners has submitted that the incident pertains to the mysterious death of late Shri Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, the brother of late Shri Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy (former Chief Minister of the united State of Andhra Pradesh) and uncle of Shri Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, the present Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and the opposite leader at the time of the incident. 2.1    It is submitted that the deceased was brutally murdered on the intervening night of 14-15/03.2019 in his house. It is submitted that the then State Government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT). However, subsequently, petitioner No.2 and Shri Y.

It is submitted that thereafter the elections to the State Assembly were held on 11.04.2019 and Shri Y. Jaganmohan Reddy became the Chief Minister and took oath on 30.05.2019. Thereafter, the SIT was re-constituted twice, but there was no progress in the investigation and therefore petitioner No.1 was constrained to approach the High Court to transfer the investigation to the CBI. However, Shri Y. Jaganmohan Reddy withdrew his petition for transferring the investigation to the CBI and the State also opposed such transfer.    However, the High Court was pleased to transfer the investigation to the CBI. 2.2    It is submitted that thereafter and after the CBI took over the investigation, there was substantial progress and in the course of time, five accused have been arrested and the chargesheet and the supplementary chargesheet have been filed.            It is submitted that however, though in the chargesheet, the role of one Y.S. Avinash Reddy, who is a sitting Member of Parliament from the ruling party in Andhra Pradesh came to light and he was mentioned as a suspect and he played a key role in the destruction of the evidence and spreading false news that the deceased died due to heart attack, the said Y.S. Avinash Reddy has not yet been arrested and the State authorities and the influential people in the State are using all kinds of tactics to scuttle the investigation with the aim to shield the said Y.S. Avinash Reddy and his close associate D. Shiv Shankar Reddy (A5). It is submitted that not only that, a false complaint came to be filed against the officers of the CBI and the CBI officers were constrained to approach the High Court against the said complaint and the High Court was pleased to stay all further proceedings. It is submitted that however the investigation has been stalled due to the pendency of the complaint and the CBI officers leaving Andhra Pradesh. It is submitted that thereafter the CBI officers have not resumed investigation anticipating more false complaints at the behest of the accused and interference by the State authorities if they resume investigation by travelling to Andhra Pradesh. 2.3    It is submitted that the people involved in the crime, with the aid and active participation of the State authorities and influential people in the State are making conscious efforts to scuttle the investigation and protect the culprits by influencing the witnesses, the investigation, and the judicial process. 2.4    It is submitted that the lives of the key witnesses and accused, specially one Shaik Dastagiri (A4) and one Ranganna (PW61) are in danger. It is submitted that one of the key witnesses has died in a suspicious manner. 2.5    It is submitted that one of the witnesses who initially agreed to give his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has been subsequently scared and he has been taken back on duty and thereafter he has refused to give his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C.           It is submitted that therefore all pressure tactics are being adopted not to further investigate. It is submitted that as the witnesses are under threat, the petitioners are apprehending that they may not get justice and therefore it is prayed to transfer the trial either to New Delhi or Hyderabad. 2.6    It is further submitted that even some witnesses are provided with special security considering life threat perception to them. It is submitted that therefore the petitioners have reasonable apprehension that there shall not be any fair and independent trial if the same is continued at CBI 3.     Shri K.M. Nataraj, learned Additional Solicitor General of India has appeared on behalf of the respondent -CBI. A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the CBI. 3.1    It is submitted that in light of the observations made by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Amravati, further investigation of the case is still continuing on the issue of larger conspiracy for murder and destruction of evidence at the scene of crime. 3.2    Now      so    far as    the   allegation  of  the   applicants    on influence/inducement/threat to the witnesses and the false and frivolous complaints against the officers of the CBI/investigating agency is concerned, it is submitted that the events unfolded during the course of investigation do indicate that several witnesses in the case are being influenced at the behest of the accused D. Siva Shankar Reddy (A5) and his close associates. It is reported that three star witnesses are already suspected to have come under the influence of A5 and other 3.3     It is submitted that in the course of investigation, one K. Gangadhar Reddy, a criminal and a close associate of the accused D. Siva Shankar Reddy (A5) himself had approached CBI and thereafter his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded. It is submitted that he volunteered to give the statement to the learned Magistrate. Therefore, the investigating officer of CBI, to get his statement recorded before the learned Court, filed an application and vide order dated 27.11.2021 the learned Court nominated the learned Judicial Magistrate (First Class), Jamalamudugu to record the statement of K. Gangadhar Reddy under section 164 Cr.P.C. However, on 29.11.2021, the said K. Gangadhar Reddy did not attend the court of JMFC, Jamalamudugu to give his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. It is submitted that on the contrary he gave a statement before the media that he is being pressurised by the CBI to give statement. It is submitted that thereafter the said K. Gangadhar Reddy had died under suspicious circumstances on 9.6.2022 in his house.     It is submitted that one another witness, namely, J. Shankaraiah was suspended for dereliction of duty in connection with the incident and whose statement was earlier recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. was to appear for recording his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C., however, he has been warned over and initially he did not appear for recording his statement pursuant to the order dated 30.09.2021. However, thereafter his suspension came to be revoked on 6.10.2021 and he was reinstated in service and therefore thereafter he is not appearing for recording his statement under section 3.4   It is submitted that two star witnesses are already under the police protection, considering the life threat perception to them. Therefore, it is submitted that there are all possibilities of influencing the witnesses and/or tampering with the evidence and there shall not be a fair further investigation on the larger conspiracy as the officers of the CBI/investigating agency are also pressurised and given threats and even false FIR is filed against them. 4.    Shri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the State and has opposed the present petition. We have heard Shri Kapil Sibbal and Shri Guru Krishnakumar, learned Senior Advocates       appearing       on      behalf     of    the    respective respondents/impleaders, who are opposing the present writ petition. The present petition is also opposed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.4. A counter affidavit is also filed on behalf of respondent No.4. 4.1   While     opposing     the    present    petition,  learned   senior counsel/counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents/impleaders have vehemently submitted that the present petition for the reliefs sought may not be entertained. 4.2    It is submitted that the primary contentions of the petitioners are in relation to witnesses being influenced and threat to lives of accused No.4 – the approver and other witnesses. It is submitted that no real threat perception to either the life of the accused or to the witnesses has been established by the petitioners. It is submitted that more than three years have passed since the murder of the deceased has happened, but none of the witnesses or accused has approached the police, CBI or Courts and alleged any threat to life. 4.3    It is submitted that in fact to witnesses, namely, Shaik Dastagiri and Ranganna have already been granted protection by the Sessions Court under the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018. 4.4    Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Amarinder Singh v. Parkash Singh Badal, (2009) 6 SCC 260, it is submitted that as observed and held by this Court, the apprehension of not getting a fair and impartial enquiry/trial is required to be reasonable and not 4.5    It is submitted that relief of transfer of trial sought in the present petition has a direct bearing on the right of defence of the accused. 4.6    It is   further   submitted  that    in  the  present   case   the chargesheet/supplementary chargesheet have been filed. It is submitted that there are more than 250 witnesses to be examined and therefore if the trial is transferred to Delhi and/or outside the State of Andhra Pradesh, it may not only cause undue hardship to those witnesses but in fact may also prejudice the accused and therefore there may not be chances of a fair trial. 5.     We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties at The present petition pertains to the mysterious death of late Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, the brother of late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy (former Chief Minister of the united State of Andhra Pradesh) and uncle of Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, the present Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and the opposite leader at the time of the incident. The present petitioner No.1 Dr. Suneetha Narreddy is the daughter of the deceased. She is a Doctor by profession.      The present petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India has been filed by the daughter and wife of the deceased, seeking transfer of trial arising out of RC-04(S)/2020/CBI/SC- III/New Delhi from CBI Special Court, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh to the CBI Special Court, Hyderabad or CBI Special Court, New Delhi, and also to direct the CBI for duly completing the investigation in the aforesaid FIR in a time bound manner. 6.        It is apprehended on behalf of the petitioners that star witnesses/witnesses are having life threat perceptions and that some of the witnesses are already influenced. Therefore, it is apprehended that there is every likelihood that there may not be a fair and impartial trial and even further investigation on the issue of larger conspiracy for murder and destruction of evidence at the scene of crime because of the influence on the part of the accused and the State machinery. 7.     In the case of Abdul Nazar Madani v. State of T.N., (2000) 6 SCC 204, in paragraph 7, it is observed and held as under: “7. The purpose of the criminal trial is to dispense fair and impartial justice uninfluenced by extraneous considerations. When it is shown that public confidence in the fairness of a trial would be seriously undermined, any party can seek the transfer of a case within the State under Section 407 and anywhere in the country under Section 406 CrPC. The apprehension of not getting a fair and impartial inquiry or trial is required to be reasonable and not imaginary, based upon conjectures and surmises. If it appears that the dispensation of criminal justice is not possible impartially and objectively and without any bias, before any court or even at any place, the appropriate court may transfer the case to another court where it feels that holding of fair and proper trial is conducive. No universal or hard and fast rules can be prescribed for deciding a transfer petition which has always to be decided on the basis of the facts of each case. Convenience of the parties including the witnesses to be produced at the trial is also a relevant consideration for deciding the transfer petition …..” 7.1    Similar view has been expressed in the case of Jayendra Saraswathy Swamigal (II) v. State of T.N., (2005) 8 SCC 771. 8.    It is true that as per the settled position of law and even as observed and held by this Court in the case of Amarinder Singh (supra) for transfer of a criminal case, there must be a reasonable apprehension on the part of the party to a case that justice may not be done. It is also observed in the said decision that it is one of the principles of administration of justice that justice should not only be done but it should be seen to be done. As observed by this Court in the aforesaid decision, however, the Court has to see whether the apprehension alleged is reasonable or not. The apprehension must not only be imaginary, but must appear to the court to be a reasonable 9.    Now let us consider whether the apprehension that justice will not be done and/or there shall not be a fair trial, is reasonable or not. The deceased was murdered on 14-15/03/2019 in his house. The then State Government constituted a SIT. Subsequently, petitioner No.2 and Y. Jaganmohan Reddy (the present Chief Minister) filed petitions before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh for transfer of investigation to CBI. That thereafter the allegations to the State Assembly were held on 11.04.2019 and the said Y. Jaganmohan Reddy became the Chief Minister and took oath on 30.05.2019.          Thereafter, the SIT was re- constituted twice, but there was no progress in the investigation and therefore petitioner No.2 was constrained to approach the High Court for transfer of investigation to CBI.       However, in view of the changed circumstances, Y. Jaganmohan Reddy withdrew his petition to transfer the investigation to CBI and the State opposed such transfer. However, the High Court was pleased to transfer the investigation to the CBI and that is how the CBI took over the investigation. During the course of investigation, the CBI filed chargesheet/supplementary chargesheet. However, pursuant to the order passed by the High Court, further investigation by the CBI on the issue of larger conspiracy of murder and destruction of evidence at the scheme of crime is still continuing. During the course of further investigation on the larger conspiracy, an FIR against the officers of the CBI is filed which has been stayed by the High Court.    It appears that therefore apprehending harassment and filing false/frivolous complaints, the CBI/investigating agency stopped further investigation. Therefore, there is a reasonable apprehension that there shall not be any fair investigation so far as the further investigation on larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence is concerned. 10.    Even two key witnesses, namely, Shaik Dastagiri and Ranganna are already given the police protection under the Witnesses Protection Scheme, 2018, pursuant to the order passed by the learned Sessions Court, considering the life threat perception. Even in the response to the present petition, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State has also produced the orders passed by the competent authority granting police protection to two witnesses. 11.   As observed hereinabove, one of the witnesses who was to record his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has not appeared for recording of his statement, though initially he volunteered to given the statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. The reason seems to be that thereafter his suspension order has been revoked and he has been taken back on 12.   From the facts narrated hereinabove, it emerges that one of the key witnesses, namely, K. Gangadhar Reddy, though initially he volunteered to give his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and the CBI submitted an application to record his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C., thereafter he did not turn up to get his statement recorded and on the contrary he made a statement before the media that he was being pressurised by the CBI. That thereafter he has died under mysterious circumstances. 13.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it cannot be said that apprehension on the part of the petitioners being daughter and wife of the deceased that there may not be a fair trial and that there may not be any independent and fair investigation with respect to further investigation on larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence at the scene of incident is imaginary and/or has no substance at all.             The petitioners being daughter and wife of the deceased have a fundamental right to get justice as victim and they have a legitimate expectation that criminal trial is being conducted in a fair and impartial manner and uninfluenced     by    any     extraneous   considerations.      Under      the circumstances, we are of the opinion that this is a fit case to transfer the trial and further investigation on larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence to the State other than the State of Andhra Pradesh. 14.    As per the settled position of law, justice is not to be done but the justice is seen to have been done also. As per the settled position of law, free and fair trial is sine qua non of Article 21 of the Constitution. If the criminal trial is not free and fair and if it is biased, judicial fairness and the criminal justice system would be at stake, shaking the confidence of the public in the system. However, at the same time, looking to the large number of witnesses to be examined during the trial and no hardship is caused to those witnesses, we are of the opinion that instead of transferring the trial to New Delhi, it may be transferred to CBI Special Court at Hyderabad. 15.    In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present writ petition is allowed. The trial arising out of RC-04(S)/2020/CBI/SC- III/New Delhi from CBI Special Court, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh is hereby ordered to be transferred to the CBI Special Court, Hyderabad. All   the   relevant    papers     including  chargesheet/supplementary chargesheet are now to be transferred to the CBI Special Court, Hyderabad.      The CBI is also directed to complete the further investigation/investigation in the aforesaid FIR on the larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence, as observed by the High Court earlier, at the earliest and it goes without saying that it must be done independently and in an unbiased manner.
1.      The Appellant married the Respondent on 02.03.1997 and registered  the  same   under     the   Special  Marriage   Act,   1954. Thereafter, the marriage was solemnized between the parties on 07.12.2000 under the Hindu rites and customs. Alleging cruelty and desertion by the Respondent, the appellant filed a suit for dissolution of marriage on 05.03.2007 before the District Judge, Alipore.        The suit was dismissed, aggrieved by which the Appellant filed an appeal before the High Court of Calcutta. The Respondent did not appear before the High Court.     However, the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant upholding the judgment of the Trial Court.       The allegation made by the Appellant against the Respondent is that she was insisting on his residing separately from his parents. Also, the Respondent misbehaved with her in-laws and that she was frequently leaving the matrimonial home.               The appellant also alleged physical assault by the Respondent when both of them went to Puri and Shillong for holidays.        The Respondent resisted the Petition filed for dissolution of marriage by denying the averments made against her. She accused the appellant of adultery and excessive consumption of alcohol. The Trial Court and the High Court refused to accept the contentions of the appellant that he is entitled for divorce by holding that he could not make out a case of cruelty meted out by the Respondent. 2.        It was submitted by Mr. Nikhil Nayyar, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant that the Appellant and Respondent have been living separately for more than 16 years and for all practical purposes the marriage is dead.        He relied upon two judgments of this Court in Sukhendu Das v. Rita Mukherjee 1              and Munish Kakkar v. Nidhi Kakkar2          in support of his submission that this Court in exercise of its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India has dissolved marriages when they are totally unworkable and 3.        We have requested Mr. Ranjan Mukherjee to assist this Court as Amicus Curiae on behalf of the Respondent as she did not engage an Advocate.        Mr. Ranjan Mukherjee informed this Court that the Respondent intends to continue to live with the Appellant.         Mr. Mukherjee informed this Court that he spoke to the Respondent several times and the Respondent is not convinced that an unworkable marriage should be put to an end.       In Sukhendu Das v. Rita Mukherjee (supra), this Court considered a similar situation where the marriage between the parties took place on 19.06.1992 and they were living apart from the year 2000. The Trial Court found that the husband could not prove cruelty by his wife and that he was not entitled for decree of divorce.    The judgment of the Trial Court was upheld by the High Court and the same was the subject matter of challenge before this Court.     The Respondent failed to appear before this Court in spite of notice being served.    By holding that there was an irretrievable breakdown of marriage, this Court dissolved the marriage between the parties therein by observing that they had been living separately for more than 17 years and no useful purpose would be served by compelling them to live together in 4.      To do complete justice between the parties, this Court in Munish Kakkar v. Nidhi Kakkar (supra) put an end to the bitter matrimonial dispute which lingered on for two decades between the parties therein. 5.      The Appellant is a police officer in the State of West Bengal and has made allegation of cruelty and desertion against the Respondent. Though the respondent has insisted that she intends to live with the Appellant, no meaningful effort has been made by her for reconciliation.  Allegations made by the Respondent relate to adultery by the Appellant which was the reason for her moving out of the matrimonial home.      In spite of the best efforts made by Mr. Mukherjee, the Respondent has insisted that she is not willing for dissolution of the marriage. Mr. Mukherjee has brought to our notice that the Respondent has to take care of her son who is suffering from serious ailments. 6.       Having scrutinized the material on record and considering the submissions made by Mr. Nikhil Nayyar and Mr. Ranjan Mukherjee, learned Amicus Curiae, without commenting on the merits    of the matter, the      marriage between     the parties    is emotionally dead and there is no point in persuading them to live together any more.      Therefore, this is a fit case for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.        The marriage between the parties is dissolved.     The Registry is directed to prepare a decree accordingly.       Taking note of the submissions made by Mr. Ranjan Mukherjee, we direct the Appellant to pay an amount     of  Rs.25  Lakhs    (Rupees   Twenty-Five   Lakhs)   to  the Respondent within a period of eight weeks from today.     The petition filed by the Respondent under Section 125 Cr. PC for maintenance shall be withdrawn by the Respondent on receipt of the amount of Rs.25 Lakhs. The payment of the aforesaid amount is in full and final settlement of all claims of the Respondent against the Appellant. 7.     The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
3       Special Leave Petition (Civil) No 3006 of 2023 arises from an interim order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 7 March 2022. In Writ Petition (Civil) Nos 95 of 2023 and 142 of 2023 under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners seek to challenge the validity of a notification dated 19 January 2023 issued by the State of Maharashtra. Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos 3007 and 3008 of 2023 arise from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 20 January 2023. 4       The Motor Vehicles Act 19881 was amended by Amending Act 32 of 2019, inter alia, to comprehend aggregators within the scope of its regulatory provisions. The expression “aggregator” has been defined in Section 2(1A) to mean a digital intermediary or market place for a passenger to connect with a driver for the purpose of transportation. Section 93 forms a part of Chapter V which deals with the control of transport vehicles. Section 93 was also amended in 2019 to cover aggregators. Section 93, as amended, reads thus: (i)     as an agent or a canvasser, in the sale of tickets for travel by public service vehicles or in otherwise soliciting custom for such vehicles, or (ii)    as an agent in the business of collecting, forwarding or distributing goods carried by unless he has obtained a licence from such authority and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the State Government. Provided that while issuing the licence to an aggregator the State Government may follow such guidelines as may be issued by the Central Government: Provided further that every aggregator shall comply with the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000) and the rules and regulations made there under.” 5       The effect of the amended provision is that no person can act as an aggregator without a licence. The licence is to be “from such authority and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the State Government”. In terms of the first proviso to Section 93(1), the State Government, while issuing a licence to an aggregator, “may follow” the guidelines issued by the Central Government. Section 96 confers a rule making power on the State Government for implementing the provisions of Chapter 6       Following the amendment of the provisions of the Act in 2019, the Union Government in the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways formulated the Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines 2020. The Guidelines commence with a prefatory statement that they have been issued “as guiding framework for State Government for issuance of licenses to transport aggregators and for the purposes of regulating the business conducted by such aggregators”. The guidelines have been issued in terms of the amended provisions of the statute, including Section 93, which stipulates that while issuing a licence to an aggregator, the State Government may follow such guidelines as may be issued by the Central Government. The Guidelines of 2020 contain diverse provisions; among them: (i)     Clause 4 which deals with the eligibility of an aggregator; (ii)    Clause 5 which provides conditions for the grant of a licence to an aggregator; (iii)   Clause 7 which lays down compliances with regard to drivers; (iv)    Clause 8 which enunciates compliances with regard to vehicles; (v)     Clause 9 which refers to compliances with regard to aggregators’ apps and (vi)    Clause 10 which stipulates compliances to ensure safety among other (vii)   Clause 13 which makes provisions for the regulation of fares. 7       Clause 15 of the Model Guidelines is extracted below: “15. Aggregatlon of non-transport vehicles by Aggregators: (1)     ln furtherance of the Central and State Government's objective of reduction in traffic congestion and automobile pollution, and effective asset utilizations, non-transport vehicle pooling may be provided by Aggregator unless prohibited by the State Government. Rationale for such prohibition shalI be specified in writing and accessible on the transport portal of the State Government. (2)     ln addition to the compliances mentioned above in these guidelines, as may be applicable, the following shall be complied with by the Aggregator seeking to aggregate non- (a)     A maximum of four ride-sharing intra-city trips on a calendar day and a maximum of 2 ride-sharing inter-city trips per week shall be permitted for each vehicle with the driver, integrated with the Aggregator. (b)     The vehicle integrated under this Clause 15 shall obtain an insurance of at least Rs. 5 lakhs for the ride-sharers in the vehicle, other than the owner or driver integrated with the 8       Clause 15(1) stipulates that the Central and the State Governments seek to pursue the objective of reducing traffic congestion and automobile pollution as well as effective asset utilization. However, clause 15 also stipulates that the pooling of non- transport vehicles may be provided by the aggregator unless prohibited by the State Government. The rationale for such a prohibition has to be specified in writing by the State Government and has to be accessible on its transport portal. 9       Government of Maharashtra has not formulated any rules in relation to aggregators for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of Chapter V, more particularly, Section 93(1). The first proviso to Section 93 stipulates that while issuing a licence to an aggregator, the State Government may follow such guidelines as may be issued by the Central Government. The Guidelines which have been issued by the Central Government have a persuasive value. They are not mandatory. When the State Government formulates rules in pursuance of its power under Section 96, it may also bear in mind the Guidelines which have been framed by the Union Government in 2020. Both in terms of the first proviso to Section 93(1) and the plain terms of the Guidelines, it is evident that while these Guidelines have to be borne in mind, the ultimate decision is to be arrived at by the State Government while considering whether to grant a licence and in regard to the formulation of rules in pursuance of the general rule making power under Section 96. 10      In the present case, the first petitioner in SLP(Civil) No 3007 of 2023 is an aggregator within the meaning of the amended provisions of the statute. The case relates to the claim of the petitioners to provide the services of an aggregator for two wheeler vehicles across the State of Maharashtra. The first petitioner made an application for the grant of a licence. By an order dated 21 December 2022, the Road Transport Officer at Pune2, rejected the application on the ground that it did not comply with various terms and conditions of the Guidelines of 2020. The relevant part of the order of the RTO is extracted below: Services Pvt. Ltd. for getting his two wheeler bike taxi aggregator license Application dated 30/11/2022 Important matters in Motor Vehicle Aggregate Rules- 2020 viz. 4 (3), 5 (1), 5(2), 5(3), 7(1)(c), 7(1)(1), 7(1)(g) ) , 7(1)(h), 7(2)(a), 7(2)(b), 7(2)(c), 7(2) ( h), 7(2)(k), 7(2) (m), 8(2), 8(3), 8(5), 8(6), 8(10), 9(1), 9(2) , 9(3) and 13 are not complete.

During the course of the hearing, the High Court was apprised of the fact that on 19 January 2023, the State Government had issued a notification bearing on the issue. 12      The notification issued by the State Government on 19 January 2023 is extracted in its entirety below: Whereas, the Government of India has, vide Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (Transport), Letter No. F. No. 1601119/2019-T, dated the 27th November 2020, issued the Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines, 2020 (hereinafter referred to as "the said Guidelines"), under the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 93 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (59 of And whereas, clauses 11 and 15 of the said Guidelines provides for ride pooling and aggregation of nontransport vehicles by aggregators, respectively. Subclause (1) of said clause 15 empowers the State Government to provide 'Rationale' for prohibition of nontransport vehicles pooling by aggregators; And whereas, it is observed that, use of non-transport vehicles (including two wheelers, three wheelers and four wheelers) as transport vehicles is on the rise enormously and raises serious practical and security concerns of the passengers and which may cause serious threat to the road safety of general public and passengers, at large; And whereas, the number of vehicles registered in the non-transport category is very large, therefore the nontransport vehicles registered outside the State of Maharashtra may also be used for the purpose of vehicle aggregation and may affect the economic viability of the vehicles operating on valid permits in the State of Maharashtra; And whereas, the issue of whether non-transport vehicles can be permitted to be used as transport vehicles, including for aggregation and ride pooling thereof requires detailed consideration regarding terms and conditions, framework and guidelines thereof. Therefore, the State Government has constituted the committee to study the said issues and to give And whereas, the Government considers it expedient to prohibit the pooling of non-transport vehicles by aggregators in order to ensure road safety of the general public and passengers at large in the State of Maharashtra; Now, therefore, the Government of Maharashtra, in pursuance of clause 15 of the Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines, 2020, hereby prohibits the use of nontransport vehicles (including two wheelers, three wheelers and four wheelers) for the purposes of aggregation and ride -pooling thereof. 13     By the above decision, the State Government has noted that the issue of whether non-transport vehicles ought to be permitted to be used as transport vehicles including for aggregation and ride pooling requires consideration. A Committee was constituted by the State Government on 12 January 2023. Pending the decision of the Committee, the State Government has prohibited the pooling of non-transport vehicles by aggregators “in order to ensure road safety of the general public and passengers at large” in the State of Maharashtra. The Committee which has been constituted by the State Government on 12 January 2023 is chaired by a former IAS officer consisting, inter alia, of the Additional Director General of Police and representatives of the Transport Department and the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation. 14     The High Court adjudicated upon the challenge to the order of the RTO dated 21 December 2022. The High Court recorded that counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners informed the Court that they would consider whether or not to challenge the notification dated 19 January 2023 separately and at that stage, the challenge was confined to the order of 21 December 2022 issued by the RTO. The High Court has also proceeded to observe that the Guidelines of 2020 leave a certain degree of latitude to the State Government and there is no policy of the State Government at the present point on the basis of which the petitioners would have an unrestricted right to obtain a licence. 15     Mr Mukul Rohatgi, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, submitted that many of the requirements of the Guidelines of 2020 on the basis of which the application for a licence was rejected are unworkable. This has been seriously in contest since Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the State of Maharashtra, has urged that the Central Guidelines are intended to ensure, above all, the safety of the passengers and drivers for which purpose certain requirements have been introduced. 16     The correctness of the order of the RTO rejecting the application for a licence on 21 December 2022 is now overshadowed by the subsequent decision of the State Government arising out of its notification dated 19 January 2023. The State Government has categorically taken a decision that the issue as to whether non- transport vehicles should be permitted to be used as transport vehicles including for aggregation and ride pooling merits detailed consideration. Pending the decision of the Committee, the State Government has taken a decision to prohibit the use of non- transport vehicles for the purpose of aggregation. 17     There was no challenge before the High Court to the notification dated 19 January 2023. Two petitions have now been instituted before this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution for the purpose of challenging the notification of the State Government. We are not inclined to entertain the challenge to the notification dated 19 January 2023 of the Home Department of the State Government in proceedings under Article 32 of the Constitution. The petitioners would be at liberty to pursue the alternate remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court. The correctness of the order of the RTO dated 21 December 2022 stands subsumed by the decision which has been taken by the High Court to entrust the examination of the entire issue by the Committee, before it decides on the use of non-transport vehicles for the purposes of aggregation and ride pooling. 18     During the course of the hearing, Mr Mukul Rohatgi submitted that while, on the one hand, the observations in paragraph 57 of the impugned judgment of the High Court reserve liberty to the petitioners to challenge the notification dated 19 January 2023, the observations in a subsequent part of the judgment, namely, paragraph 59 would preclude such a challenge. 19     In order to allay the above grievance, it needs to be clarified that while considering a challenge to the notification dated 19 January 2023, the High Court shall not consider itself bound by its observations in paragraph 59. At any rate, the latter observations are only in the context of the challenge to the decision of the RTO dated 21 December 2022 which alone was a subject matter of the proceedings before the 20     In the above backdrop, we grant liberty to the petitioners to move the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution for the purpose of challenging the notification of the State Government dated 19 January 2023. The High Court shall consider any such challenge uninfluenced by the observations contained in the impugned judgment and order dated 20 January 2023. 21     The order of the RTO dated 21 December 2022 indicates that it has been passed on the ground that the provisions of the Guidelines of 2020 were not complied with. Once the State Government takes a final decision on the submission of the report of the Committee, the petitioners would be entitled to pursue their legal remedies after complying with such terms and conditions as may be prescribed in the decision of the State Government. The State Government shall take a final decision on or before 31 March 2023. The Committee shall take its final decision on or before 15 March 2023 so as to leave time to the State Government to take a considered decision by the end 23     Pending applications, including application for intervention, stand disposed of.
1       The petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution to challenge the constitutional validity of Section 33(7) of the Representation of 2       Apart from the above challenge, the petitioner seeks a direction to the Central government and the Election Commission of India to take appropriate steps to restrict any person from contesting an election for the “same office” from more than one constituency 3       At this stage, it would also be material to note that the third prayer, prayer (c), which sought a direction to the Union government and the Election Commission “to take appropriate steps to discourage independent candidates from contesting the Parliamentary and Assembly elections” was rejected by an order of this Court dated 11 December 2017. 4       The basis of the petition is that on 5 July 2004, the Chief Election Commissioner urged the then Prime Minister to amend Section 33(7) of the Act of 1951 insofar as it permits a person to contest from more than one constituency for the same office simultaneously. The petitioner urges that the Law Commission in its 255th Report had opined that the Representation of the People Act 1951 should be amended to provide that a person should not be permitted to contest from more than one seat at a time. 5       We have heard Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and Mr R Venkataramani, Attorney General for India. The Election Commission of India has also appeared in these proceedings through its counsel, Mr Amit Sharma. 6       Counter affidavits have been filed by the Union of India and the Election Commission. 7       During the course of the hearing, Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan, senior counsel urged that the petition implicates an issue under Article 19 of the Constitution. It has been submitted that citizens exercise their right to vote after knowing about a candidate’s character, qualifications and criminal antecedents among other details. When a candidate who contests from two seats, is elected from both, one of the two seats has to be vacated. Apart from the financial burden which is imposed on the public exchequer for holding a bye-election, it has been urged that the electorate which has cast its vote in favour of a candidate on the basis of the representations which were held out during the course of campaigning would be deprived of being represented by that candidate for the Parliamentary or, as the case may be, the State Legislative Assembly constituency. Consequently, it has been urged that the electorate which has opted for a candidate in pursuance of its right to know under Article 19(1)(a) would be deprived of its right when the candidate vacates the seat. 8       Section 33(7) of the Act of 1951 provides as follows: “Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (6) or in any other provisions of this Act, a person shall not be nominated as a candidate for election,— (a)     in the case of a general election to the House of the People ( whether or not held simultaneously from all Parliamentary constituencies), from more than two Parliamentary (b)     in the case of a general election to the Legislative Assembly of a State (whether or not held simultaneously from all Assembly constituencies), from more than two Assembly constituencies in that State; (c)     in the case of a biennial election to the Legislative Council of a State having such Council, from more than two Council constituencies in the State; (d)     in the case of a biennial election to the Council of States for filling two or more seats allotted to a State, for filling more than two such seats; (e)     in the case of bye-elections to the House of the People from two or more Parliamentary constituencies which are held simultaneously, from more than two such Parliamentary (f)     in the case of bye-elections to the Legislative Assembly of a State from two or more Assembly constituencies which are held simultaneously, from more than two such Assembly (g)     in the case of bye-elections to the Council of States for filling two or more seats allotted to a State, which are held simultaneously, for filling more than two such seats; (h)     in the case of bye-elections to the Legislative Council of a State having such Council from two or more Council constituencies which are held simultaneously, from more than two such Council constituencies. Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, two or more bye-elections shall be deemed to be held simultaneously where the notification calling such bye-elections are issued by the Election Commission under Sections 147, 149, 150 or, as the case may be, 151 on the same date.” 9       The above provision was inserted by Act 21 of 1996 with effect from 1 August 1996. It is common ground between senior counsel and the Attorney General for India that prior to 1 August 1996, there was no bar on the number of seats which a candidate could contest in the course of one election, be it for Parliamentary or State Legislative Assembly constituencies. Parliament has stepped in to provide that a candidate cannot contest more than two seats simultaneously in one and the same election. 10      The issue which has been raised by the petitioner pertains to the legislative domain. Undoubtedly, where a candidate contests more than one seat simultaneously in the course of the same general election, one seat has to be vacated if the candidate succeeds in both the electoral contests. That necessitates a bye-election. The petitioner has highlighted the fact that this involves a drain on the public exchequer. The issue, however, is whether this by itself would result in the invalidation of a statutory provision. 11      A statutory provision can be challenged before the Court either on the ground that it has been made by a legislature which lacks legislative competence to enact a law or on the ground that there is a violation of a Fundamental Right in Part III of the Constitution. The former is not in issue. 12      Permitting a candidate to contest from more than one seat in a Parliamentary election or at an election to the State Legislative Assembly is a matter of legislative policy. It is a matter pertaining to legislative policy since, ultimately, Parliament determines whether political democracy in the country is furthered by granting a choice such as is made available by Section 33(7) of the Act of 1951. A candidate who contests from more than one seat may do so for a variety of reasons not just bearing on the uncertainty which the candidate perceives of an election result. There are other considerations which weigh in the balance in determining whether this would restrict the course of electoral democracy in the country. This is a matter where Parliament is legitimately entitled to make legislative choices and enact or amend legislation. The Law Commission and the Election Commission may at the material time have expressed certain viewpoints. Whether they should be converted into a mandate of the law depends on the exercise of Parliamentary sovereignty in enacting legislation. Absent any manifest arbitrariness of the provision so as to implicate the provisions of Article 14 or a violation of Article 19, it would not be possible for this Court to strike down the provision as unconstitutional. 13      This will not restrain Parliament from taking an appropriate view if it decides to do so at any point of time in pursuance of its legislative authority. Parliament has intervened in the past in the form of Act 21 of 1996 which restricts the choice of a candidate for electoral contest to two seats in one and the same election. 14      For the above reasons, we are of the view that no relief can be granted in these
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional Government Advocate representing the State of U.P./opposite party no. 1 and perused the The present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been filed by the petitioner with the prayer to quash the order dated 27.03.2019 passed by learned Principal Judge, Deoria in maintenance petition no.74 of 2016 (Sunita Vs. Sanjeev), under Section 125 Cr.P.C., Police Station Gauri Bazar, District Deoria and order passed by learned Principal Judge, Deoria in Execution Case No.516 of 2021 (Sunita Vs. Sanjeev) arising out of original case no. 74 of 2016. Brief facts which are required to be stated are that marriage of the petitioner was solemnized on 23.02.2014 with respondent no. 2, but their marriage was not successful. On account of acrimonious relationship between them, petitioner left her to her parental house on 12.06.2015. Thereafter she moved an application under section 125 Cr.P.C. dated 16.02.2016 claiming maintenance of Rs.40,000/- per month from the petitioner making allegation of harassment and torture against him, in which the Family Court vide order dated 27.03.2019 has directed the petitioner to pay an amount of Rs.1500/- per month as interim maintenance to the respondent no.2 from the date of order. On non- payment of the interim maintenance, respondent no.2 has initiated execution proceeding against the petitioner by moving an application dated 12.07.2021, in which show cause notice has been issued to the petitioner by the Family Court by order dated Main substratum of argument of learned counsel for the petitioner is that several litigation between the parties are going on, therefore Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Deoria has committed legal error in granting interim maintenance of Rs. 1500/- per month to the opposite party no.2, but after advancing his argument at some length, when the Court put certain query to him, he gave up his challenge to the aforesaid impugned order dated 27.03.2019 on merit and confined his submission praying to grant some reasonable time to the revisionist, so that he may deposit the entire arrears of maintenance amount in installments. Learned Additional Government Advocate opposed the said prayer of learned counsel for the petitioner by contending that there is no illegality in the impugned order dated 27.03.2019.The grounds taken by the petitioner challenging the impugned order are not sustainable in law. After having heard the argument of learned counsel for the parties, this Court feels it appropriate that no useful purpose would be served in keeping this petition pending before this Court and the same may be disposed of at this stage itself. Though after some argument the petitioner is not pressing the impugned order dated 27.03.2019 on merit, but considering the rival submissions of the parties, I am of the view that the amount of interim maintenance awarded is not only meager one, but also insufficient for respondent no. 2. It is the duty and responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife with all dignity. Now a days it is extremely difficult to conceive that a women would be in a position to maintain her with the amount of Rs. 1500/- per month. The inherent and fundamental principle behind Section 125 Cr.P.C. is far amelioration of financial state of affairs as well as mental agony and anguish that women suffers when she is compelled to leave her matrimonial home. The Amendment Act 2001 introduced an express provision for grant of "interim maintenance" under section 125 Cr.P.C. and power has been vested to the concerned Court to order for making a monthly allowance towards interim maintenance during pendency of the petition. In view of judgment of the Supreme Court in the matter of Rajnesh versus Neha and another, (2021) 2 SCC 324, the interim maintenance has been rightly granted to respondent no. 2, therefore, this Court feels that no interference is required in the impugned order dated 27.03.2019, as under the facts of the case, the same does not suffer from any illegality. The relief as sought by the petitioner in the instant case is hereby refused. However, considering the alternative prayer of the petitioner, three months' time is allowed to the petitioner to pay the entire amount of arrears of interim maintenance to the respondent no.2 pursuant to impugned order dated 27.03.2019, in three equal installments. First, second and third installments shall be paid on or before 12.02.2022, 12.03.2022 and 12.04.2022. Further the current amount of interim maintenance from the month of January, 2022 to onwards shall be paid by the petitioner as per order dated 27.03.2019. With the aforesaid observations and directions, the instant Petition is disposed It is clarified that in case of default of payment of interim maintenance as directed above, the same shall be recovered in accordance with law. Office is directed to send the copy of this order to the concerned court below as well as to the respondent no.2 within ten days.
2.      The appellants before us are Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (in short “ONGC”), a public sector undertaking engaged in the business of exploration and production of oil and gas. In this appeal, they assail a judgment of the Bombay High Court delivered on 30th January, 2020 in Writ Petition No. 13015 of 2019 in which the claims of workmen to be entitled to fixation of pay and other allowances as per an award of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal No. II, (“Tribunal”) Mumbai has been upheld with certain modification in the implementation part of that award.        The controversy involved in this proceeding originates from a Direct Action notice raised by a Union (Oil Field Employees Association represented by their President-respondent no.1 in the present appeal) on 26th August, 2016. The workmen, whose cause the said Union were espousing, were engaged by and getting their salaries paid through different contractors appointed by the ONGC. ONGC’s stand all along has been that these were contractors’ workmen – and not workmen of ONGC. In fact, ONGC’s case is that another settlement has been reached with the Unions representing majority of the contractors’ workmen (over 77%) and that settlement arrived at on 19th September, 2016 is binding on all similar workmen including those represented by the respondent Unions. We shall address this issue later in this judgment.     Earlier,  there    were    three   memoranda      of understanding reached in the years 1992, 1995 and 2000 involving ONGC and different Unions representing the contract workmen working with the ONGC. These memoranda covered wages, allowances and other facilities to be provided by the contractors to the “contract labour”. Copies of these memoranda of understanding have been annexed at pages 93, 102 and 113 of the paperbook. The 2000 MoU had lapsed on 31st December, 3.    There had been certain parallel developments on the industrial front involving ONGC and Unions espousing the cause of workmen engaged by their contractors, which cast a shadow on the dispute giving rise to this appeal. Six Unions representing workmen engaged by contractors had submitted a charter of 28 demands against ONGC and 57 of their contractors. This was admitted for conciliation. ONGC wanted to introduce a Fair Wage Policy (“FWP”) to cover contract employees. Negotiation in that regard had started among the parties.  A Memorandum of Settlement was signed on 19th September, 2016 (to which we have already referred) under which the FWP extended to contract labourers of Western Offshore Unit, Mumbai was agreed to be implemented at all work-centers of ONGC.       This settlement, according to the appellants, was in terms of Section 12(3) read with Section 18(3)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (the Act) and entailed upward revision of wages as also certain other measures of social protection including job security. The signatories to this settlement were contractors’ representatives and representatives of six Unions “In the presence of and representing principal employers” as also the Conciliation Officer. The representatives of ONGC signed in the capacity of representatives of the principal employer. The Tribunal and the High Court, however, held that the aforesaid arrangement was not settlement within the meaning of Section 18(3)(d) of the Act and was not binding on the workmen involved in the subject dispute. The Tribunal had also referred to certain order of status quo passed by the High Court to sustain its finding on this count. We shall however address this issue on merit, testing the reasoning of the High Court given in the impugned 4.    The respondent-Oil Field Employees Association (the actual party-respondent no. 1 is the President of the Oil Field Employees Association) issued the Direct Action Notice on 26th August, 2016 to the appellants. This Union was registered in the year 2014 and claims to represent workmen engaged by contractors of the ONGC. On 19th September, 2016 itself, one P.D. Sunny, Conciliation Officer called the appellants and the first respondent for conciliation of dispute arising out of the notice for direct action of 26th August, 2016. On 26th September, 2016, a Charter of Demands was submitted before the Conciliation Officer with a copy to the appellants. The main demand of the respondent no.1 was that wages and service conditions of the workmen engaged by the contractor should be at par with the regular employees of ONGC. 5.    Thereafter, in course of conciliation proceeding the FWP was brought on record and the respondent no. 1 questioned the legitimacy of the FWP. The conciliation records subsequently were transferred from said P.D. Sunny to one Dr. S. Gunahari, Mumbai.      The latter recorded failure of conciliation and forwarded the failure report to the Central Government. The dispute then was referred by the Central Government to the Tribunal and it was registered as Ref. CGIT No.2/40 of 2017. The reference order was made by the Central Government on 18th September, 2017 in terms of Section 10(2A) (1) (d) of the Act. The order of reference was in the following terms:- “Whether the following demands of The President, Oil Field Employees Association are legal and justified? 1. To have uniform policies for all the workers irrespective of the contracts in the establishment of ONGC. Revisions w.e.f. 1.1.2008. release an advance of Rs.50,000/- per worker and to adjust it with the arrears after implementation of the Pay Revisions. If not, to what relief the workmen are entitled to?” 6.    ONGC questioned the legality of the order of reference in a writ petition filed in the High Court of Bombay (registered as Writ Petition No.5045 of 2018).            This writ petition was not entertained by a Division Bench of the High Court and was rejected by an Order passed on 29th January, 2019. It was, “8) It is further to be noted that in pursuance to the communication addressed by the Petitioner to the Chief Labour Commissioner, a Conciliation Officer vide his notice dated 15th September 2016 kept the matter for conciliation on 19th September, 2016 at 12:30 hrs. Perusal of the minutes would reveal that in the said meeting, the representative of the Petitioner as well as the Respondent No.3 were directed to do certain compliances. However, it appears that on same day i.e. 19th September 2016 at 15:00 hrs., settlement was entered into by the representatives of the certain Union and ONGC and 57 contractors of the ONGC. It is to be noted that though the said settlement was to be arrived on the same day, the Petitioner neither informed the Conciliation Officer in the present proceedings about such a settlement being arrived at. The conduct of the Petitioner in not bringing to the notice of the Conciliation Officer in the present proceedings, the settlement which was to arrive within hours with representative of certain Unions before some other Conciliation Officer, in our considered view is not a conduct befitting the employer who is an organ of State and State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. 9) It is further to be noted that though the Respondent No.3 and the Petitioner have completed their pleadings before the learned CGIT and though there were rounds of litigations, which reached upto this Court arising out of the interlocutory orders, the Petitioner has chosen to move this Court for ad-interim orders only after the matter was kept for their evidence. We are of the considered view that having consciously submitted to the jurisdiction of the learned CGIT, it is not now open for the Petitioner to complain at such a belated stage that the reference was not warranted. 10) Apart from that the question as to whether the settlement arrived at between some of the Unions at one hand and the Petitioner's contractors on the other hand is binding on the Respondent No.3 and intervenors, can be very well looked into by the learned Tribunal in the proceedings before it. 11) In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to entertain the present Petition in its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The Writ Petition is therefore rejected.” 7.   In the reference, two other Unions participated and were impleaded as parties therein on the basis of their applications. These two Unions are Maharashtra Sanghatit Asanghatit Kamgar Sabha (respondent no.2) and Maharashtra Employees Union (respondent no.3). 8.   The Tribunal by its Order passed on 17th July, 2019 in substance allowed the claim of the workmen articulated through “1. The reference is allowed. 2. It is declared that the demands of the union to have uniform policies for all the workers establishment of ONGC and to get the MOU renewed with pay revision w.e.f. 1.1.2008 are legal & justified. 3. First party management is directed to enter into MOU with second party unions with pay revision w.e.f. 1.1.2008 and implement the same within 2 months from the date of order. management is directed to pay arrears arising out of implementation of MOUs within 2 months from the date of order failing which concerned workmen would be entitled to interest @ 6% per annum on the arrears and other benefits to which they are entitled to on implementation of MOU.” 9.    The High Court sustained the award in the writ petition brought by ONGC on substantive issues but partly allowed the petition challenging the legality thereof, inter-alia, holding:- “20. Coming now to the reliefs formulated by it, it is but apparent that the tribunal does not appear to have applied its mind to individual revisions that may have to be made. As we have noted above, there is no infirmity in the conclusion of the tribunal that wage revisions had to be on the lines of MbPT settlement for the relevant period, but then based on related MbPT settlements, the court had to work out individual wage revisions for different categories of workmen, whose cause was espoused by the second party unions in the present case. The tribunal, firstly, had to work out individual revised wage scales and allowances for workmen at 12 Victoria Dock and Nhava Supply Base; it, then, had to formulate reasonable consolidated wages for workmen other than those working in 12 Victoria Dock and Nhava Supply Base. This the tribunal appears to have clearly failed to do. It left it to the parties to work out the individual revisions. That I am afraid is not possible. It is one thing to say that the basis of wage revision is available in a document and quite another to apply that basis to the individual facts of the case. For example, it is one thing to say that workmen other than those working in 12VD and Nhava Supply Base were to be paid wages, that is, consolidated wages, worked out on the basis of minimum basic wages of the concerned categories of MbPT workers plus adjustments towards allowances, and quite another to actually provide for and stipulate such consolidated wages so calculated and adjusted. This was obviously for the tribunal to do and not for the parties to work out. The tribunal appears to have clearly missed this point. To that extent, the matter must go back to CGIT scales/allowances of workmen working in 12VD and Nhava Supply Base (based on MbPT scales/allowances) as well as other workmen covered by the reference (for consolidated wages based on MbPT scales and allowances). 21. The question then is of interim relief to be consideration of the matter on remand by CGIT. It is a matter of fact, and probably a sad commentary on the times that we live in, that the last wage revision of these workmen occurred as far back as in 2000. That wage revision was applicable only till 31 December 2007 and till date, there has been no further revision in sight, though at least three revision periods have gone by. On these facts, this court is of a considered view that it would be in the interest of justice to at least direct ONGC to pay wages to the workmen concerned on the basis of what was agreed in the settlement of 19 September 2016 minus its condition of withdrawal of proceedings against ONGC. These would indeed be minimum wages that might in any case be payable to the concerned workmen, that is to say, even if the unions were wrong in the matter of calculation of wages in accordance with the particulars submitted with the statement of claim. If, on the other hand, they were right that the workmen were entitled to get wages in accordance with the particulars submitted by them, these interim revised wages could then be adjusted against such wages. 22. The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of by setting aside the operative order passed by CGIT and remitting the reference, being Reference No.CGIT-2/40 of 2017, to CGIT-2, Mumbai for a fresh decision on (i) individual wage scales and (ii) consolidated wages payable, respectively, to the contract workmen of ONGC working at (i) 12 Victoria Dock and Nhava Supply Base and (ii) the other workmen covered by the reference. It is made clear that such determination must be in the light of what has been observed above, in particular that the wage revision/s of these workmen has/have to be on the lines of the wage revision/s applicable to workmen of MbPT, which are placed before the court (i.e. MbPT settlements applicable for the periods from 2007 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2016). 23. The tribunal is requested to accord top priority to this determination and dispose of the reference as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a period of eight months from the date this order is pointed out to the tribunal. To that end, either party may appear before the tribunal with notice to the other side and produce an authenticated copy of this order. The tribunal may thereupon fix the schedule of hearings and decide the reference accordingly. 24. Pending hearing and final disposal of the reference on remand, interim wages shall be paid to the concerned workmen by ONGC for the whole of the period of revision in accordance with MoS of 19 September 2016 and also prospectively from the month of March 25. Since the operative part of the award of CGIT has been set aside, pending criminal proceedings for non-implementation of the award shall not be proceeded with.” 10. The workmen, whose cause the three Unions espouse were those who were inducted by contractors and were getting their salaries paid through the contractors only. The main claim of the workmen was for having a uniform policy for all workmen, irrespective of contracts under which they were engaged in the matter of wages and allowances. Last of the memoranda of understanding signed in the years 1992, 1995 and 2000 was executed on 29th December, 2000. The wage revision provided for in the last memorandum of December, 2000 was to operate till 31st December, 2007. Primarily, signatories to these memoranda are the appellants-employer and the Unions. The respective    contractors  were  not  signatories   to   these memoranda. One of the major characteristics of the terms contained therein, though not specifically spelt out in the memoranda themselves, is that the wages and allowances agreed upon therein were linked to the lines of settlement signed between Mumbai Port Trust (earlier Bombay Port Trust) and their workmen.    We shall henceforth refer to that settlement as MbPT Settlement. These memoranda classified contract employees in two categories, one set working for Victoria Dock 12 and Nhava Supply base and the other set working at various other locations including Mumbai and Uran. There was variance in pay and allowance between these two categories of workmen. This was in the case of 1992 settlement whereas the 1995 settlement followed similar line of categorisation, but included workmen engaged in Panvel to Mumbai and Uran.        The same form of categorisation was there in the “2000 Settlement.” 11. Appearing on behalf of the appellants Mr. Cama, learned senior counsel, has primarily argued on two points. His first submission has been that the reference itself was not maintainable as none of the workmen the Unions were representing or espousing the causes of were employed by the appellants. He has pointed out the definition of workmen in Section 2(s) of the Act in this behalf. The other point on which submission was advanced by him was that the Settlement arrived at on 19th September, 2016 covered all the employees of contractors, considering the provisions of Section 18(3)(d). The Unions have been represented by Mr. Pallav Shishodia, learned senior counsel and Mr. Shaligram G. Mishra, respondent no. 1 appearing in person. The stand of the Unions on the other hand has been that the concerned workmen were actually employees of the appellants and before the Tribunal itself, it was their case that their engagement by the contractor would not by itself make them contractors’ employees.      It is also their stand that the settlement of 19th September, 2016 could not be treated to be one under Section 18(3)(d) of the Act to bind the workmen represented by the three Unions in this appeal. First, it has been contended that the said settlement has not taken final shape as certain procedural aspects for conclusion thereof is yet to be taken. It has also been argued on their behalf that the said settlement related to contractors’ workmen only whereas the workmen involved in the present proceeding were not employees of the contractors who had signed the said settlement. On the other hand, the workers represented by the Union are working in the establishment of the appellants for a long period of time and they claimed to be entitled to the service benefits directly from ONGC. 12. The Tribunal rejected the objection on jurisdictional ground taken on the point that the concerned workmen were not employees of the appellants and hence no dispute could lie with ONGC. The Tribunal has also given the finding that the FWP could not be treated as fair settlement as it entailed withdrawal of the proceedings lodged by individual workmen or Unions. It has been urged on behalf of the respondents that many of these proceedings were for regularization or absorption directly into the appellant company, a dispute which has intricate link with the controversy involved in the present proceeding. Mr. Cama has asserted that the finding of the High Court on facts was perverse, and, on that count, he invited interference by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. He has relied on the decisions of this Court in the cases of Workmen of the Food Corporation of India vs. Food Corporation of India [(1985) 2 SCC 136], Parimal Chandra Raha & Ors. vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India and Corporation Ltd. and Anr. vs. Shramik Sena & Ors. [(1996) 6 SCC 439] and Steel Authority of India Ltd. & Ors. vs. 1] in support of his submission that the workmen of the contractor would not become the workmen of the principal employer. He has also cited the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. vs. Uma Devi & Ors. [(2006) 4 SCC 1] to contend that there could not be backdoor entry of contractors’ employees directly into the establishment of the principal employer. This genre of cases has been cited mainly in support of two propositions of law urged on behalf of the appellants. First is that there must be a jural relationship brought about by an agreement to establish employer- employee relationship between contractors’ employees and that of the principal employer. Secondly, abolition of contract labour in certain industries does not result in automatic absorption of the workmen engaged by them in the concerned establishment. In the case of Parimal Chandra Raha (supra), however, it has been held that where there was statutory requirement of maintaining of canteens and the canteens of the   respondent    corporation   had   become    part  of  the establishment, the contractors engaged from time to time in reality were agencies of the corporation and were only a veil between the corporation and canteen workers. In the case of Steel Authority of India Limited of 2001 (supra), it has been held that abolition of contract labour in certain in any part of an establishment by a notification under Section 10(1) of the Contract Labour (Regularization and Abolition) Act, 1970 (1970 Act) automatically does not lead to absorption of contract labour working in those parts directly in the establishment      concerned.      The    case     of    Indian Petrochemicals (supra) mainly follows the ratio laid down in the case of Parimal Chandra Raha (supra). The proposition of law laid down in the case of Steel Authority of India Limited vs. Union of India & Ors. reported in [(2006) 12 SCC 233] is that mutually destructive plea that the employees were of contractor and the principal employer could not be taken. The ratio of the decision of Uma Devi (supra) also would not apply in the facts of the present case. Here, the issue is not of backdoor entry into an establishment but finding out subsisting status of a set of workmen on the question as to who is their actual employer. For determination of the fate of the dispute raised by Unions, adjudication of the former question becomes inevitable. 13. Mr. Cama has emphasised on the ratio of the case of Mukand       Ltd.     vs.     Mukand        Staff     and     Officers’ Association [(2004) 10 SCC 460]. In this judgment it has “23. We have already referred to the order of reference dated 17-2-1993 in paragraph supra. The dispute referred to by the order of reference is only in respect of workmen employed by the appellant Company. It is, therefore, clear that the Tribunal, being a creature of the reference, cannot adjudicate matters not within the purview of the dispute actually referred to it by the order of reference. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal could not have adjudicated the issue of salaries of the employees who are not workmen under the Act nor could it have covered such employees by its award. Even assuming, without admitting, that the reference covered the non-workmen, the Tribunal, acting within its jurisdiction under the Act, could not have adjudicated the dispute insofar as it related to the “non- workmen.” 14. As regards the lack of jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine or adjudicate the dispute between the appellants and the workmen represented by the three Unions, perusal of the award does not reveal that this point was pressed before the Tribunal by the employer. We accept that the Tribunal could not go beyond the disputes that were referred to it, as held in the case of Mukand Ltd. (supra). But legality of the order of reference was challenged by ONGC in Writ Petition(C) No. 5045 of 2018. In the judgment of the Division Bench, which we have already quoted, it was opined on the aspect of jurisdiction of the Tribunal, that it was not open for the petitioner to complain at such a belated stage that the reference was not warranted. In the judgment of the High Court under challenge before us, this question was dealt with “5. Apropos the first objection of Mr. Talsania, which, according to him, goes to the root of the matter, it must be noted at the very outset that the jurisdiction of the tribunal in the present case to adjudicate the reference was never questioned by ONGC on the ground that the workmen represented by the second party were not ‘workmen’ within the meaning of section 2(s) of the Act, particularly, because they were employees of contractors and not of ONGC. If this issue was not part of the lis before the reference court, there was no way it could be raised before the writ court. The issue is, after all, a mixed issue of law and facts; it would have to be adjudicated first before the trial court upon foundational pleadings in that behalf being led before it, before the writ court, in its scrutiny of the order of the trial court, could be asked to go into 6. Mr. Talsania, however, submits that the fact that these workmen were employees of contractors is not really in dispute; the reference itself termed them as workmen engaged through contractors. The question is not whether the workmen were engaged through contractors. That may indeed be an apparent position. The question is whether, by reason of perennial nature of the work at the premises of the principal employer, and having regard to the circumstances bearing on their service and service conditions, whether the workmen could be said to be in reality employees of the principal employer despite the apparent position that they were engaged through contractors. Indeed, there was a clear statement on the part of the workmen in the statement of claim of the second party that they were in fact and in reality workmen of ONGC and not of the contractors. No doubt, in its written statement, ONGC contested this position, and in their rejoinder second party No.2 union reiterated its statement that the contract/s was/were sham and bogus. It is apparent from the impugned award of the tribunal, however, that this issue was not pressed by ONGC at the hearing. The issue anyway reflected on the jurisdiction of CGIT to adjudicate the reference and ONGC did not choose to contest the jurisdiction on the issue. Had the issue been pressed by ONGC before the reference court, the second party would have led appropriate evidence in support of its case in this behalf. It obviously chose not to do so, because this question was not debated by ONGC before the reference court. Could the second party be then visited with the consequence of having to deal with this issue merely on the basis of the material available before this court at the stage of a scrutiny under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India. The answer would be an emphatic “no”. The second party would most certainly be seriously inconvenienced if it were now required to sustain its plea in the statement of claim of the workmen being in reality employees of ONGC, without having had an opportunity to lead evidence in support of such case before trial court. For whatever reasons, ONGC found it worth its while not to contest the jurisdiction of the tribunal in the reference and this court, sitting as a writ court, must leave the matter at that and not scrutinize it any further.” 15. On the question of raising issue of lack of jurisdiction before the Tribunal, the cases of Rattan Lal Sharma vs. Secondary School & Ors. [(1993) 4 SCC 10], Secretary to Govt. of India and Others vs. Shivram Mahadu Gaikwad [(1995) Supp (3) SCC 231] and Kalyani Sharp India Ltd. vs. Labour Court No.1, Gwalior & Anr. [(2002) 9 SCC 655] were relied upon by the appellants. We accept, as a proposition of law, that if irregularity or illegality committed by a Tribunal touches upon the jurisdiction to try and determine over a subject dispute is altogether beyond its purview, that question would go to the root of the matter and it would be within the jurisdiction of the superior court to correct such error. In the case of Kalyani Sharp India Ltd. (supra) raising a plea on application of law was found permissible at the appellate stage before this Court, but in that case no fresh investigation of fact was required. But in the facts of the present case, it is not the question of inherent lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Tribunal. The question of jurisdiction, as held by the High Court was a mixed question of fact and law. Both the cases of Rattan Lal Sharma(supra) and Kalyani Sharp India Ltd. (supra) arose out of admitted fact. In the case of Shivram Mahadu Gaikwad (supra) it was the limitation question which went to the root of the matter. This case arose out of a proceeding before the Central Administrative Tribunal. Point was taken before the Tribunal by the Union of India but was not addressed to in the judgment of the Tribunal. So far as the present proceeding is concerned, as reflected in the judgment under appeal, there was a clear statement on the part of the workmen in the statement of the second party (Union) before the Tribunal that in fact and reality, the concerned workmen were employees of ONGC and were not of the contractors. This was denied by the ONGC but in their rejoinder the said Union reiterated their stand that the contracts were sham and bogus. In the award, certain other reference orders were cited which involved adjudication of the question as to whether contracts between ONGC’s contractors and workmen engaged by them were sham and bogus. (Ref. No. CGIT I 16, 17, 18 and 19/2005) or not and if the said workmen in reality were ONGC’s workmen only. In the case of Steel Authority of India of 2001 (supra), it has been laid down that in cases where plea is raised that a contract is found to be sham and nominal, a camouflage to suppress the actual status of a workman vis-à-vis who his employer is, the veil could be pierced to find out the such status. If to this perspective is added the fact that earlier three MoUs were entered into directly by ONGC with the Unions representing contractors’ workmen, this question does not remain a question of law alone, to be sustained with the aid of the ratio of the cases of Rattan Lal Sharma (supra), Shivram Mahadu Gaikwad (supra) and Kalyani Sharp India Ltd. (supra). Signatories to the earlier MoUs were the appellants and the Unions and Section 30(2) of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 permits contract labourers to enter into   agreements    with   principal  employers.   Thus,    by themselves, the aforesaid MoUs would not establish that the contract workmen are workmen of the principal employer. But the circumstances which we have narrated clearly point to the relationship between the appellants and the workmen represented by the respondent Unions in that direction. The stand that the concerned workmen were employees of the principal employer were not specifically outlined in the reference, but was implicit therein. In the reference order the dispute therein was between ONGC and the Union. The Charter of Demand was also raised against ONGC. The Tribunal examined the issue and returned its finding which was upheld by the High Court. This was a finding of fact. In the case of National Engineering Industries Limited vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors. [(2000) 1 SCC 371] it has been held that the Industrial Tribunal is the creation of statute and it cannot go into the question on validity of the reference. That issue ought to be considered by the High Court, according to the appellants. So far as the present proceeding is concerned, the High Court has considered that question and we do not find any error in the approach of the High Court in deciding the jurisdiction question against the appellants. 16. Next comes the issue as to whether the settlement of 19th September, 2016 was binding on the Unions who are before us as respondents, having regard to the provisions of Section 18(3) (d) of the Act. Section 18 of the Act stipulates:- “18. Persons on whom settlements and awards are binding.- (1) A settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and workman otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceeding shall be binding on the parties to the agreement. sub-section (3), an arbitration award which has become enforceable shall be binding on the parties to the agreement who referred the dispute to arbitration. (3) A settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceedings under this Act or an notification has been issued under sub- section (3A) of section 10A or an award of a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal which has become enforceable shall be (a) all parties to the industrial dispute; (b) all other parties summoned to appear in the proceedings as parties to the dispute, unless the Board, arbitrator, Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal, as the case may be, records the opinion that they were so (c) where a party referred to in clause (a) or clause (b) is an employer, his heirs, successors or assigns in respect of the establishment to which the dispute relates; (d) where a party referred to in clause (a) or clause (b) is composed of workmen, all establishment or part of the establishment, as the case may be, to which the dispute relates on the date of the dispute and all persons who subsequently become employed in that establishment or part.” 17. In the case of Ramnagar Cane and Sugar Company Ltd. vs. Jatin Chakravorty & Ors. [(1960) 3 SCR, 968], the binding nature of a settlement on all persons employed in an establishment has been explained, having regard to Section 18(3)(d) of the Act. This principle was reaffirmed in the case of General Manager, Security Paper Mill, Hoshangabad vs. R.S. Sharma and Others [(1986) 2 SCC 151]. It has been laid down in the case of Ramnagar Cane and Sugar Company “5. In appreciating the merits of the rival contentions thus raised in this appeal it is necessary to bear in mind the scheme of the Act. It is now well settled that an industrial dispute can be raised in regard to any matter workmen acting through a union or otherwise. When an industrial dispute is thus raised and is decided either by settlement or by an award the scope and effect of its operation is prescribed by Section 18 of the Act. Section 18(1) provides that a settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and the workman otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceeding shall be binding on the parties to the agreement; whereas Section 18(3) provides that a settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceedings which has become enforceable shall be binding on all the parties specified in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of sub-section (3). Section 18(3)(d) makes it clear that, where a party referred to in clauses (a) or (b) is composed of workmen, all persons who were employed in the establishment or part of the establishment, as the case may be, to which the dispute relates on the date of the dispute and all persons who subsequently become employed in that establishment or part, would be bound by the settlement. In other words, there can be no doubt that the settlement arrived at between the appellant and the Employees' Union during the course of conciliation proceedings on February 25, 1954, would bind not only the members of the said Union but all workmen employed in the establishment of the appellant at that date. That inevitably means that the respondents would be bound by the said settlement even though they may belong to the rival Union. In order to bind the workmen it is not necessary to show that the said workmen belong to the Union which was a party to the dispute before the conciliator. The whole policy of Section 18 appears to be to give an extended operation to the settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceedings, and that is the object with which the four categories of persons bound by such settlement are specified in Section 18, sub-section (3). In this connection we may refer to two recent decisions of this Court where similar questions under Section 19(6) and Section 33(1)(a) of the Act have been considered.      (Vide: Associated      Cement Companies Ltd., Porbandar v. Workmen [ Civil Appeal No. 404 of 1958 decided on 3.3.1960] and New India Motors (P.) Ltd. v. K.T. Morris.” Same proposition of law was reiterated in the case of Barauni Refinery Pragatisheel Shramik Parishad vs. 18. In the case of ANZ Grindlays Bank Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors. [(2005) 12 SCC 738], this Court, while testing a reference found no subsisting industrial dispute and the reference was set aside. This authority also does not assist the appellants in the facts of the present case. 19. Now we shall test the appellants’ arguments on binding effect of the settlement dated 19th September, 2016 on the workmen whose cause the respondent Unions are espousing before us. The High Court dealt with this question in the “13. That brings us to the question as to whether the MoS of 19 September 2016, even if it were to be termed as a settlement in the course of a conciliation proceeding, could be said to be a fair settlement so as to bind workmen who were not party to it. The tribunal, in the present case, has arrived at an unequivocal finding that the settlement could not be termed as fair. It, particularly, has taken into account the fact that the MoS of 19 September 2016 required the workmen concerned to withdraw their legitimate disputes and complaints on the issues of regularization, etc. as a condition of settlement. It is important to bear in mind in this behalf that when the reference was made, there were about 1300 workmen, covered by the earlier MoU 29 December 2000, who were originally sought to be protected as against about 2000 of total number of contract employees with ONGC working in Mumbai, Panvel, Uran and Nhava. The other employees were not covered by the MoUs executed earlier by ONGC with the unions. If these other workmen and their union/s were to agree to a fair wage policy, which is not on the basis of the earlier MoUs executed between ONGC and the unions, such policy, on the basis of such agreement, cannot be termed as a fair policy for the workmen covered by the earlier MoUs and whose references or complaints for their legitimate demands were pending before various industrial adjudicators. Anyway, on the facts available before this court, the conclusion of the Tribunal that the MoS of 19 September 2016 could not be termed as a fair settlement, particularly, for the workmen covered by the earlier MoUs, cannot be termed as perverse. This court cannot bring itself to hold that no reasonable person could have given any such finding. The finding is clearly supported by some evidence; it does take into account all relevant and germane circumstances and materials; and it does not consider any non-germane or irrelevant circumstance or material. It must, in that case, pass muster as a possible conclusion, which is not amenable to judicial scrutiny either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India.” 20. The appellants’ case is that Unions representing above 77 percent of the workmen engaged by the contractors had agreed to that settlement.      In the case of Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. vs. Their Workmen [(1981) 4 SCC 627], this Court permitted a settlement to be binding which was assailed by a set of workmen. In that case, one set of Unions had entered into a settlement which had been assented to by 564 out of 635 daily-rated workmen. The finding of the Tribunal was that the settlement was not just and fair. This Court, however, allowed the appeal of the employer and set aside the award. But this judgment is not an authority for the proposition that a different set of workmen cannot raise an industrial dispute claiming to be workmen directly under the principal employer. Recognition of such right of minority workmen would be apparent from paragraph 12 of the said report [(1981) 4 SCC “12. There is no quarrel with the argument addressed to us on behalf of the workers that mere acquiescence in a settlement or its acceptance by a worker would not make him a party to the settlement for the purpose of Section 18 of the Act [vide Jhagrakhan Collieries (P) Ltd. v. G.C. Agarwal, 2 SCR 873] ]. It is further unquestionable that a minority union of workers may raise an industrial dispute even if another union which consists of the majority of them enters into a settlement with the Ltd. v. Workmen [(1978) 3 SCC 42 : 1978 SCC (L&S) then here the Company is not raising a plea that the 564 workers became parties to the settlement by reason of their acquiescence in or acceptance of a settlement already arrived at or a plea that the reference is not maintainable because the Telco Union represents only a minority of workers. On the other hand the only two contentions raised by the “(i) that the settlement is binding on (ii) that the reference is liable to be and fair.” 21. In the case of ITC Ltd. Workers’ Welfare Association & Anr. vs. Management of ITC Ltd. & Anr. [(2002) 3 SSC 411], “14. In answering the reference the industrial adjudicator has to keep in the forefront of his mind the settlement reached under Section 12(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act. Once it is found that the terms of the settlement operate in respect of the dispute raised before it, it is not upon to the Industrial Tribunal to ignore the settlement or even belittle its effect by applying its mind independent of the settlement unless the settlement is found to be contrary to the mandatory provisions of the Act or unless it is found that there is non-conformance to the norms by which the settlement could be subjected to limited judicial scrutiny….” 22. In the instant case we do not find the settlement of 19th September, 2016 to be one which would be binding on the minority Union. That was a settlement essentially between the contractors and workmen engaged by the former. The appellants were only consenting parties to the settlement. This position of the appellants is apparent from the description of the parties to the said settlement, which 23.   The dispute out of which the present appeal arises relates to the question as to whether the workmen engaged by the contractors would be entitled to pay at par with other workmen of the employer and demand to that effect was raised with the appellants only. The respondent Unions claimed to be, in reality, employees of ONGC and the demand was raised upon the latter, and not on their contractors. The nature of their demand was thus different particularly as regards the status of the workmen, i.e., their claim to be workmen of ONGC. Thus, the settlement of 19th September, 2016, in which the employers were the contractors cannot bind the subject-dispute, where the appellants have been found to be the employer on the basis of materials considered by the High Court.     Their engagement by the contractors cannot be the sole basis for determining their status as workmen of contractors. 24. For     these  reasons,   we  accept   the  High   Court’s affirmation of Tribunal’s finding that the settlement of 19th September, 2016 did not bind the workmen whose cause the respondent Unions are espousing. The finding of the Tribunal that the settlement involving implementation of the FWP was not just and fair, which finding has been sustained by the High Court is essentially a finding on facts based on appreciation of evidence. We are of the opinion that such finding is not tainted by any element of perversity. The ratio of the decision in the case of ITC Ltd. Workers’ Welfare Association (supra) would not apply in the facts of the present case. 25. Having held so, we would not like to interfere with the relief directed to be given by the High Court. The scope of jurisdiction of the Industrial Court is wide and in appropriate cases it has the jurisdiction even to make a contract. In our opinion, the directives issued by the Tribunal, as modified by the High Court are reasonable and cannot be termed as perverse. In the case of Steel Authority of India of 2006 (supra), referring to the Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 it was “20. The 1970 Act is a complete code by itself. It not only provides for regulation of contract labour but also abolition thereof. Relationship of employer and employee is essentially a question of fact. Determination of the said question would depend upon a large number of factors. Ordinarily, a writ court would not go into such a question.” So far as the judgment under appeal is concerned, the High Court has taken a similar approach and we do not intend to take a different view.     The principle of limited interference would apply to a proceeding of this nature under the 1947 Act. 26. The appeal is accordingly dismissed and the impugned judgment is sustained. Interim order, if any, shall stand 27. Other applications, if any, stand disposed of. 28. There shall be no order as to costs.
2.   With the consent of the learned advocates appearing for the respective parties, the petition was taken up for its final disposal. 3.   In this petition, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the prayer of the petitioner is to quash and set aside the appointment order dated 24.7.2019 of the respondent No.3 appointing him as Assistant Director of Information 4.   The facts in brief indicate that the petitioner possesses educational    qualification     of    B.Com     and     Diploma           in Journalism. He had worked as a reporter in Sandesh from 1.4.2008 to 7.10.2009. He then worked with Divyabhaskar as Senior Reporter. The petitioner was appointed as Information Assistant, Class III in the department of Information and Broadcasting of the State on 21.5.2010. He has been serving on the promotional post of Senior Sub Editor since 26.12.2018. An advertisement was issued on 5.11.2015 inviting applications for Direct Recruitment to the posts of Assistant Director of Information (Editorial), Class II. The petitioner applied for the post. The recruitment is held by the department and not GPSC. 5.   Ms. Harshal Pandya, learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the recruitment rules dated 16.2.2015 provide for the rules for recruitment. The Rules through mistake use the word “Editorial” instead of “Journalism.” For being eligible for appointment by direct selection, the candidate must possess the qualification mentioned in rule 4 of the Rules. She would submit that a candidate must have       the  requisite  qualification    so   prescribed.           The respondent No.3 does not hold the requisite experience and therefore      the  petitioner     made   a    representation            on 24.6.2019. According to Ms. Pandya, the respondent No.3 holds a certificate of having worked from November, 2009 to     September,     2014   as      sub editor     in    “Namaskar Publication.” He worked in “Sanj Samachar” which is a daily newspaper from February, 2014 to August, 2014. She would therefore submit that simultaneously working in two publications was improper. Drawing the Court’s attention to certificate of experience, she would submit that apart from the certificate having no date, it was owned by one Editor Kishor Makwana. She would rely on an RTI response to submit that the Namaskar Magazine was deblocked in the year 1962. The certificate therefore was bad. She would therefore submit that over and above the educational qualification, the respondent No.3 did not possess the required experience as the magazine Namaskar was run by an individual entity and, therefore, apart from working at two places at the same time, the respondent No.3 was not qualified. 6.   Mr.      Krutik Parikh,  learned       AGP   appearing          for the respondent - State would submit that as per Rule 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(ii), the respondent was having a Masters Degree in Journalism. He had experience of approximately three years, fifteen months and twenty three days working in `Namaskar       Magazine’     and      in  `Divyabhaskar’            from 9.10.2014 to 31.10.2015. As far as the recruitment done through      the employer department, and not through GPSC, Mr. Parikh would submit that as per Regulation No.3 of the GPSC (Exemption from Consultation) Rules, 1960, the respondent department had got exemption from the consultation. 7.   Mr. Harsh K. Raval, learned counsel appearing for respondent       No.3  would     submit     that    the      answering respondent is working in the field of journalism for the last more than 14 years and had experience as Sub-Editor in `Namaskar Magazine’ from November, 2019 to September, 2014 where he was working from 8.00 am. In `Sanj Samachar’,       the respondent        No.3 was working               from February, 2014 to August, 2014 in evening hours. The time period       therefore was     not      overlapping.       `Namaskar Publication’ which was blocked was owned by one Jivraj Aarya whereas the respondent was working in a different registration number publication namely; Surya Namaskar. The experience provided in the Rules was satisfied by the respondent No.3 as the Rules clearly provided that one should have combined or separate experience in either of the entities mentioned in the Rules. 8.

Considering           the   submissions     made    by     the       learned advocates for the respective parties, to adjudicate upon the eligibility of the respondent No.3 for being entitled to hold the post of Assistant Director (Journalism) Class II, it will be proper to reproduce the relevant Rule namely; Rule 4 of the Assistant Director of Information (Journalism) Class II Recruitment Rules, 2015. Rule 4 reads as under: “4. To be eligible for appointment by direct selection to the post mentioned in Rule 2, a (a)   Not be more than 35 years of age: Provided that the upper age limit may be relaxed in favour of a candidate who is already in the service of the Government of Gujarat in accordance with the provisions of the Gujarat Civil Services Classification and (b) Possess: a post graduate diploma in Journalism and Mass Communication or a post graduate degree in Journalism and Mass Communication obtained from any of the Universities established or incorporated by or under the Central or a State Act in India, or any other educational institution recognized as such by the Government or declared to be deemed as University under section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956; or possess an equivalent qualification recognized by the Government; and (i)     have about three years experience on the post not below the rank of Information Assistant, Class III, in the subordinate service of the Commissionerate of Information; or (ii) have about three years combined or separate experience of Journalism or publicity or public relation work or organizing exhibition or editing a daily newspaper or electronic media or periodicals in the Government or Local Bodies or Government undertaking Board or Corporation or Limited Company established under the Companies Act, 1956 or public or private sector daily newspaper or news agency or electronic media or publicity organization on the post which can be considered equivalent to the post nor below the rank of Information Assistant, Class III, in the subordinate service of the Commissionerate of Information; or (II) a degree in Journalism and Mass Communication or a degree in Journalism obtained from any of the Universities established or incorporated by or under the Central or a State Act in India; or any other educational institution recognized as such by the Government or declared to be deemed as University under section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956; or possess an equivalent qualification recognized by the Government; and (i)   have about five years experience on the post not below the rank of Information Assistant, Class III, in the subordinate service of the Commissionerate of (ii) have about five years combined or separate experience of Journalism or publicity or public relation work or organizing exhibition or editing a daily news paper or electronic media or periodicals in the Government or Local Bodies or Government undertaking Board or Corporation or Limited Company established under the Companies Act, 1956; or public or private sector daily newspaper or news Agency or electronic media or publicity organization on the post which can be considered equivalent to the post not below the rank of Information Assistant, Class III, in the subordinate service of the Commissionerate of Information. (c) possess the basic knowledge of computer application as prescribed in the Gujarat Civil Services Classification and (d) possess adequate knowledge of Gujarati or Hindi or both.” 11. Reading the Rule makes it clear that an incumbent apart from holding a post-graduate diploma in Journalism, which the respondent No.3 possessed should have about 3 years’ combined experience in the Editorial work as under and in (3)  Government        Under   Taking       Board          or (4)  Limited Company established under the 12. Nowhere does Recruitment Rule stipulate that it has to be in only a government or local body or a government undertaking board or the Corporation or a Company. This would amount to restrictive reading of the Rule and, therefore, it cannot be said that the respondent No.3 does not possess the requisite experience. 13. For the aforesaid reasons, the petition is dismissed. Rule is discharged. No order as to costs.
2.   The short question involved in the present appeal is, as to whether the “sum” awarded under clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the “1996 Act”) would include the interest pendente lite or not? 3.    The undisputed facts in the present case are as under: 4.    On being declared as the successful bidder, a Concession Agreement dated 25th August, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as “the Concession Agreement”), was entered into between the (hereinafter referred to as “DAMEPL”) and the respondent­Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “DMRC”). As per the Concession Agreement, the respondent­DMRC was to carry out the civil works (excluding at the Depot) and the balance works (including the Depot civil works and the Project systems works) were to be executed by the appellant­DAMEPL. As per Article 29 of the Concession Agreement, in the event of termination, it was the respondent­DMRC, which was liable to make Termination Payment (as defined in the Concession 5.    During the course of operations of the project, a dispute arose between the appellant­DAMEPL and the respondent­ DMRC.      The appellant­DAMEPL terminated the Concession Agreement by Termination Notice dated 8 th October, 2012. The respondent­DMRC referred the dispute to Arbitration under Article 36.2 of the Concession Agreement on 23 rd October, 2012. An Arbitral Award came to be passed on 11 th May, 2017. On 12th May, 2017, the appellant­DAMEPL paid a stamp duty of Rs.4,72,20,000/­ on the Award. Certain interim orders were also passed in the interlocutory proceedings by the Delhi High Court.    Since the respondent­DMRC was aggrieved by the Award, it filed a Petition under Section 34 of the 1996 Act in Delhi High Court, being OMP (COMM) No.307 of 2017, challenging the Arbitral Award dated 11 th May, 2017. Vide the judgment and order dated 6th March, 2018, the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitral Award and rejected the respondent­DMRC’s petition under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. The said judgment and order dated 6 th March, 2018 came to be challenged by the respondent­DMRC before the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court by way of appeal being FAO(OS)(COMM) No. 58 of 2018.       The said appeal was partly allowed by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court vide the judgment and order dated 15 th January, 2019. Being aggrieved thereby, the appellant­DAMEPL preferred Civil Appeal No.5627 of 2021 [arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.4115 of 2019] before this Court. The said appeal came to be allowed by this Court by judgment and order dated 9 th September, 2021, vide which the judgment and order dated 15 th January, 2019, passed by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court was set aside. 6.    The appellant­DAMEPL thereafter immediately filed an Execution Petition being OMP (ENF.) (COMM) No. 145 of 2021 on 12th September, 2021, before the Delhi High Court for enforcement of the Arbitral Award dated 11 th May, 2017 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal. Various orders came to be passed by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in the said proceedings from time to time. Vide the impugned judgment and order dated 10th March, 2022, the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court issued certain directions with regard to the payment to be made by the respondent­DMRC towards the satisfaction of the Award.    Vide the impugned judgment and order, the application(s) for impleadment filed by the Canara Bank and the Union Bank of India came to be rejected. In the said proceedings, a contention was raised on behalf of the appellant­DAMEPL that the sum, as specified under clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act, would include interest for a period from the date on which the cause of action arose to the date on which the award was made.         The said contention was rejected by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court by the impugned judgment and order. Being aggrieved thereby, the present appeal by way of special leave. 7.    We have heard Shri Harish N. Salve, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant­DAMEPL and Shri Parag P. Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent­DMRC. 8.     Shri Harish N. Salve, learned Senior Counsel, submits that the issue is no more res integra. The majority judgment of this court in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited vs. Governor, State of Orissa through Chief Engineer 1 has clearly held that, upon a plain reading of clauses (a) and (b) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act, it is clear that in the sum for which an Award is made, interest may be included for the pre­award period, and that for the post­award period, interest up to the rate of 18% per annum may be awarded on such sum directed to be paid by the Arbitral Tribunal. Learned Senior Counsel, therefore, submits that the amount under clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act would include the Termination Payment of Rs.2782.33 crores plus the amount of interest granted by the Arbitral Tribunal from the date of cause of action till the date of the award. As such, it is the contention of the appellant­DAMEPL that the sum, as specified in clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act, would be an amount of Rs.4662.59 crores.           It is further submitted that the sum, which is arrived at Rs.4662.59 on the correct construction of clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act, would therefore carry the interest as awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal from the date of the award till the date of payment.    The learned Senior Counsel would submit that the aforesaid interpretation is the only logical interpretation. He submits that the High Court has, therefore, erred in rejecting the claim of the appellant­DAMEPL with regard to addition of the interest pendente lite in the sum to be arrived at under clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of 9.     Shri Parag P. Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel, on the contrary, would submit that the High Court has correctly rejected the claim of the appellant­DAMEPL. He submits that clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act itself begins with the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties”. He submits that there is a specific agreement between the parties under Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement, with regard to payment of interest. Learned Senior Counsel submits that since there is an agreement between the parties as to how the interest would be awarded and that since the same has been awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the agreement, the majority judgment of this Court in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra) would not be of any assistance to the case of the appellant­DAMEPL. He therefore submits that the present appeal deserves to be dismissed. 10. As already stated hereinabove, the present appeal needs to be decided in the narrow compass of interpretation of clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act. 11. Shri Harish N. Salve, learned Senior Counsel is justified in relying on the majority judgment of this Court in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra). S.A. Bobde, J. in his judgment in the said case observed thus: “2. It is not possible to agree with the conclusion in S.L. Arora case [State of Haryana v. S.L. Arora and Co., (2010) 3 SCC 690 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 823] that Section 31(7) of the Act does not require that interest which accrues till the date of the award be included in the “sum” from the date of award for calculating the post­ award interest. In my humble view, this conclusion does not seem to be in consonance with the clear language of Section 31(7) of the Act. 3. Sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act, which deals with the power of the Arbitral Tribunal to award interest, reads as “31.(7)(a)    Unless     otherwise agreed by the parties, where and insofar as an arbitral award is for the   payment     of money,    the Arbitral Tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole an arbitral award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, 4. Clause (a) of sub­section (7) provides that where an award is made for the payment of money, the Arbitral Tribunal may include interest in the sum for which the award is made. In plain terms, this provision confers a power upon the Arbitral Tribunal while making an award for payment of money, to include interest in the sum for which the award is made on either the whole or any part of the money and for the whole or any part of the period for the entire pre­award period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made. To put it differently, sub­section (7) (a) contemplates that an award, inclusive of interest for the pre­award period on the entire amount directed to be paid or part thereof, may be passed. The “sum” awarded may be the principal amount and such interest as the Arbitral Tribunal deems fit. If no interest is awarded, the “sum” comprises only the principal. The significant words occurring in clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act are “the sum for which the award is made”. On a plain reading, this expression refers to the total amount or sum for the payment for which the award is made. Parliament has not added a qualification like “principal” to the word “sum”, and therefore, the word “sum” here simply means “a particular amount of money”. In Section 31(7), this particular amount of money may include interest from the date of cause of action to the date of the award. 5. The Oxford Dictionary gives the following meaning to the word “sum”: Sum, ‘if noun’.—A particular amount of money. Sum, ‘if verb’.—The total amount resulting from the addition of two or more numbers, amounts, or items. 6. In Black's Law Dictionary, the word “sum” is given the following meaning: “Sum.—In English law—A summary or abstract; a compendium; a collection. Several of the old law treatises are called ‘sum’. Lord Hale applies the term to summaries of statute law. Burrill. The sense in which the term is most commonly used is ‘money’; a quantity of money or currency; any amount indefinitely, a sum of money, a small sum,      or   a     large    sum. United States v. Van Auken [24 L Ed 852 : 96 and Donovan v. Jenkins [52 Mont 124 : 155 P 972 at p. 973] .” 7. Thus, when used as a noun, as it seems to have been used in this provision, the word “sum” simply means “an amount of money”; whatever it may include — “principal” and “interest” or one of the two. Once the meaning of the word “sum” is clear, the same meaning must be ascribed to the word in clause (b) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act, where it provides that a sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award “shall … carry interest …” from the date of the award to the date of the payment i.e. post­award. In other words, what clause (b) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act directs is that the “sum”, which is directed to be paid by the award, whether inclusive or exclusive of interest, shall carry interest at the rate of eighteen per cent per annum for the post­ award period, unless otherwise ordered. 8. Thus, sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act provides, firstly, vide clause (a) that the Arbitral Tribunal may include interest while making an award for payment of money in the sum for which the award is made and further, vide clause (b) that the sum so directed to be made by the award shall carry interest at a certain rate for the post­award period. 9. The purpose of enacting this provision is clear, namely, to encourage early payment of the awarded sum and to discourage the usual delay, which accompanies the execution of the award in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court vide Section 36 of the Act. 10. In this view of the matter, it is clear that the interest, the sum directed to be paid by the arbitral award under clause (b) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act is inclusive of interest pendente lite. 11. At this juncture, it may be useful to refer to Section 34 CPC, also enacted by Parliament and conferring the same power upon a court to award interest on an award i.e. post­award interest. While conferred power on a court to order interest “on the principal sum adjudged” and not on merely the “sum” as provided in the Arbitration Act. The departure from the language of Section 34 CPC in Section 31(7) of the 1996 Act is significant and shows the intention of Parliament. 12. It is settled law that where different language is used by Parliament, it is intended to have a different effect. In the Arbitration Act, the word “sum” has deliberately not been qualified by using the word “principal” before it. If it had been so used, there would have been no scope for the contention that the word “sum” may include “interest.” In Section 31(7) of the Act, Parliament has deliberately used the word “sum” to refer to the aggregate of the amounts that may be directed to be paid by the Arbitral Tribunal and not merely the “principal” sum without interest. 13. Thus, it is apparent that vide clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act, Parliament intended that an award for payment of money may be inclusive of interest, and the “sum” of the principal amount plus interest may be directed to be paid by the Arbitral Tribunal for the pre­ award period. Thereupon, the Arbitral Tribunal may direct interest to be paid on such “sum” for the post­award period vide clause (b) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the Act, at which stage the amount would be the sum arrived at after the merging of interest with the principal; the two components having lost their separate 14. In fact this is a case where the language of sub­section (7) clauses (a) and (b) is so plain and unambiguous that no question of construction of a statutory provision arises. The language itself provides that in the sum for which an award is made, interest may be included for the pre­award period and that for the post­award period interest up to the rate of eighteen per cent per annum may be awarded on such sum directed to be paid by the arbitral award.” 12. Abhay Manohar Sapre, J. in his concurring judgment in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra) has also agreed with the view of S.A. Bobde, J. 13. It could thus be seen that the majority view of this Court in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra) is that the sum awarded may include the principal amount and such interest as the Arbitral Tribunal deems fit.   It is further held that, if no interest is awarded, the “sum” comprises only the principal amount. The majority judgment held that clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act refers to the total amount or sum for the payment for which the award is made. As such, the amount awarded under clause (a) of sub­ section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act would include the principal amount plus the interest amount pendente lite. It was held that the interest to be calculated as per clause (b) of sub­ section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act would be on the total sum arrived as aforesaid under clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act. S.A. Bobde, J. in his judgment, has referred to various authorities of this Court as well as Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes. He emphasized that the Court must give effect to the plain, clear and unambiguous words of the legislature and it is not for the Courts to add or subtract the words, even though the construction may lead to strange or surprising, unreasonable or unjust or oppressive results. 14. Sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act is already reproduced in the judgment of S.A. Bobde, J. in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra).              Applying the principle of plain interpretation of the language employed by the legislature, the position that would emerge, on an analysis of clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act, is (i)   It begins with the words “Unless otherwise agreed by (ii)  where and insofar as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the Arbitral Tribunal may include interest component in the sum for which the award is (iii) the interest may be at such rate as the Arbitral Tribunal deems reasonable; (iv)  the interest may be on the whole or any part of the (v)   the interest may be for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made. 15. It could thus be seen that the part which deals with the power of the Arbitral Tribunal to award interest, would operate if it is not otherwise agreed by the parties.     If there is an agreement between the parties to the contrary, the Arbitral Tribunal would lose its discretion to award interest and will have to be guided by the agreement between the parties. The provision is clear that the Arbitral Tribunal is not bound to award interest. It has a discretion to award the interest or not to award. It further has a discretion to award interest at such rate as it deems reasonable. It further has a discretion to award interest on the whole or any part of the money. It is also not necessary for the Arbitral Tribunal to award interest for the entire period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made. It can grant interest for the entire period or any part thereof or no interest at all. 16. We find that in the present case, the words “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” would assume significance. The said words fell for consideration before this Court in the case of N.S. Nayak & Sons vs. State of Goa2. This Court in the said case had an occasion to consider the scope of the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” in various provisions of the 1996 Act. This Court observed thus: “14. … The phrase ‘unless otherwise agreed by the parties’ used in various Sections, namely, 17, 21, 23(3), 24(1), 25, 26, 29, 31, 85(2)(a), etc. indicates that it is open to the parties to agree otherwise. During the arbitral proceedings, right is given to the parties to decide their own procedure. So if there is an agreement between the parties with regard to the procedure to be followed by the arbitrator, the arbitrator is required to follow the said procedure. Reason being, the arbitrator is appointed on the basis of the contract between the parties and is required to act as per the contract. However, this would not mean that in appeal parties can contend that the appellate procedure should be as per their agreement.” 17. This Court in the case of Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions vs. Divisional Railway Manager (Works), Palghat and others3 had an occasion to directly consider the aforesaid phrase as employed by the legislature in sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act. R.V. Raveendran, J. in the said case observed thus: “19. Section 31(7) of the new Act by using the words ‘unless otherwise agreed by the parties’ categorically clarifies that the arbitrator is bound by the terms of the contract insofar as the award of interest from the date of cause of action to the date of award. Therefore, where the parties had agreed that no interest shall be payable, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest between the date when the cause of action arose to the date of award.” 18. If clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act is given a plain and literal meaning, the legislative intent would be clear that the discretion with regard to grant of interest would be available to the Arbitral Tribunal only when there is no agreement to the contrary between the parties. The phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” clearly emphasizes that when the parties have agreed with regard to any of the aspects covered under clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act, the Arbitral Tribunal would cease to have any discretion with regard to the aspects mentioned in the said provision. Only in the absence of such an agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal would have a discretion to exercise its powers under clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act. The discretion is wide enough. It may grant or may not grant interest. It may grant interest for the entire period or any part thereof. It may also grant interest on the whole or any part of the money. 19. If the contention as raised on behalf of the appellant­ DAMEPL is to be accepted, the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” would be rendered redundant and would become otiose. 20. It will be apposite to refer to the following observation of this Court in the case of Reserve Bank of India vs. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. and others4: “33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute­maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place. It is by looking at the definition as a whole in the setting of the entire Act and by reference     to   what    preceded    the enactment and the reasons for it that the Court construed the expression “Prize Chit” in Srinivasa [(1980) 4 SCC 507 : (1981) 1 SCR 801 : 51 Com Cas 464] and we find no reason to depart from the Court's construction.” 21. It could thus be seen that each and every word and each and every phrase mentioned in the provision will have to be given effect to.      Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place. 22. An       important    aspect  that   has  to  be   taken  into consideration is that the 1996 Act itself emphasizes on party autonomy. As such, the legislative intent is clear that when the parties have agreed to the contrary on any of the aspects as mentioned in clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act, the Arbitral Tribunal will cease to have any discretion and would be bound by an agreement between the parties. 23. As already discussed hereinabove, any interpretation which would render the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” otiose or redundant will have to be avoided. It will be apposite      to  refer  to  the  following  observations  of  the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Hardeep Singh vs. State of Punjab and others5: “44. No word in a statute has to be construed as surplusage. No word can be rendered ineffective or purposeless. Courts are required to carry out the legislative intent fully and completely. While construing a provision, full effect is to be given to the language used therein, giving reference to the context and other provisions of the statute. By construction, a provision should not be reduced to a “dead letter” or “useless lumber”. An interpretation which renders a provision otiose should be avoided otherwise it would mean that in enacting such a provision, the legislature was involved in “an exercise in futility” and the product came as a “purposeless piece” of legislation and that the provision had been enacted without any purpose and the entire exercise to enact such a provision was “most unwarranted besides being uncharitable”. (Vide Patel Chunibhai             Dajibha v. Narayanrao 1457] , Martin Burn Ltd. v. Corpn. of Elisabeth v. Harwan        Investment      and Begum v. Prem Chand Jain [(1997) 1 SCC 373] , State of Bihar v. Bihar Distillery 1511]       , Institute      of     Chartered Union v. Registrar            of         Coop. 24. If the interpretation, as placed by the appellant­DAMEPL is to be accepted, the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” would be reduced to a “dead letter” or “useless lumber”. In our considered view, such an interpretation would be wholly 25. It appears from the facts in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra) that there was no agreement between the parties with regard to payment of interest. Such is not the case here.    It will be relevant to refer to Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement, which reads thus: Termination Payment pursuant with the necessary particulars duly certified by the Statutory Auditors. If DMRC fails to Payment within 30 (thirty) days, the amount remaining unpaid interest at an annualised rate of SBI PLR plus two per cent for 26. It could thus clearly be seen that as per Article 29.8 of the Concession    Agreement,   the   Termination   Payment     would become due and payable to the Concessionaire by DMRC within thirty days of a demand being made by the Concessionaire. It further provides that if the DMRC fails to disburse the full Termination Payment within 30 days, the amount remaining unpaid shall be disbursed along with interest at an annualized rate of SBI PLR plus two per cent for the period of delay on such amount. It can thus clearly be seen that Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement deals with payment of interest on Termination Payment amount. 27. The Arbitral Tribunal rightly construing the Concession Agreement has directed thus: “129. Therefore,       the      Termination Payment to DAMEPL works out to 538.58 crores =Rs. 2782.33 crores. As regards rate of interest on the Termination payment, the stipulation of Article 29.8 of CA is at an annualized rate of SBI PLR +2%. We have noted from the financial CD11­Supplementary reply of DMRC dated 22.2.2014 to the Counter Claim of the Respondent) that the secured loan taken by DAMEPL carries the rate of interest of 12.75% on Rupee Term Loan and is in the range of 4.83% to 5.6% for Foreign Currency Loan. Although the rates of interest on loans taken by DAMEPL are lower than SBI PLR +2%, we are of the opinion that it is beyond the competence of the Tribunal to change or alter or modify the provisions of CA. As such, we decide that the Termination payment will be as per the provisions of Article 29.8 of CA and     the     interest     on     the Termination payment will accrue from 7.8.2013 (i.e. the date 30 on 08.07.2013). In terms of Article 29.9 of CA, this amount shall be which are available in Annexure CC­4 of the Counter Claim. We 28. It is thus clear that the Arbitral Tribunal has directed that the Termination payment would be as per the provisions of the Concession Agreement and the interest on the Termination payment would accrue from 7th August, 2013 (i.e., the date 30 days after the demand of Termination payment by DAMEPL on 8th July, 2013). It is pertinent to note that though the Arbitral Tribunal has found that the rates of interest on loans taken by the appellant­ DAMEPL are lower than SBI PLR + 2%, it has observed that it was beyond the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal to change or alter or modify the provisions of the Concession Agreement.      The Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, has granted interest at an annualized rate of SBI PLR + 2%, though it had found that the rate of interest on which the loan was taken by the appellant­DAMEPL was on the lower side.          The Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, has rightly given effect to the specific agreement between the parties with regard to the rate of interest. We find that the arbitral award has been passed in consonance with the provisions as contained in clause (a) of sub­section (7) of Section 31 of the 1996 Act and specifically, in consonance with the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the 29. As already discussed herein above, from the majority judgment of S.A. Bobde and Abhay Manohar Sapre, JJ. in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra), it would appear that the situation, where there was an agreement between the parties on the point of payment of interest, did not fall for consideration in the said case. 30. We may gainfully refer to the three­judge Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Union of India and others vs. Dhanwanti Devi and others6, wherein this Court has observed thus: “9. …..Every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there is not intended to be exposition of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found…” 31. It can thus clearly be seen that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved. The generality of the expressions which are found in a judgment cannot be considered to be intended to be exposition of the whole law. They will have to be governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. 32. It will also be apposite to refer to the following observation of another three­Judge Bench of this Court in the case of The Regional Manager and another vs. Pawan Kumar Dubey7: “7. ……Even where there appears to be some conflict, it would, we think, vanish when the ratio decidendi of each case is correctly understood. It is the rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and circumstances of a case which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar. One additional or different fact can make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts.” 33. This Court has held that the ratio decidendi is the rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and circumstances of a case which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar. It has been held that one additional or different fact can make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts. 34. As     discussed   hereinabove,   in  the    case  of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra), there was no agreement between the parties with regard to the payment of interest and as such, the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties” did not fall for consideration in the said case. As a caution, we have also gone through the judgment of the High Court from which the appeal arose to this Court in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra).          A perusal of the said judgment would also reveal that there was no agreement between the parties with regard to payment of interest.        As such, in the case of Hyder Consulting (UK) Limited (supra), this Court did not have an occasion to consider the import of the phrase “unless otherwise agreed by the parties”. 35. We are therefore of the considered view that in view of the specific agreement between the parties, the interest prior to the date of award so also after the date of award will be governed by Article 29.8 of the Concession Agreement, as has been directed by the Arbitral Tribunal. The findings recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal have reached finality in view of the judgment and order dated 9th September, 2021, passed by this Court in Civil Appeal No.5627 of 2021 [arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.4115 of 2019]. 36. We therefore, see no error in the observations of the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in paragraph 30 of the impugned judgment and order dated 10th March, 2022, passed in Execution Petition being OMP (ENF.) (COMM) No. 145 37. In the result, we find no merit in the present appeal. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. 38. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
1.      Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. With the consent of the parties heard finally. 2.      The petitioner has filed the present writ petition seeking direction to the respondent No.4 – Head Master, Zillha Parishad Primary School, Murti, Tq. Ghansawangi, Dist. Jalna, to correct the date of birth in the school record where the petitioner was studying from 22/01/1991 to 22/08/1993. 3.      It is the case of the petitioner that his actual date of birth is 22/08/1993 and at the time of admission at Anganwadi, his date of birth was correctly recorded. At the time of his admission to 1 st Standard in the respondent No.4- Zillha Parishad Primary School, Murti,     his    birth      date was wrongly entered     as    22/02/1991. Accordingly, the same birth date was mentioned in the School Leaving Certificate. The father of the petitioner, thereafter, filed an application dated 10/11/2021, for correction of the school record. The application filed by the father of the petitioner, was forwarded to respondent No.2 - Education Officer (Primary) for correction of the birth date in the school record. The petitioner had also filed Criminal Misc. Application No.90 of 2021, before the Judicial Magistrate (F.C.), Ghansawangi, independently for recording of his birth date, under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969.                         He contended in the said application that he was born on 22/08/1993. In support of the said application, he filed evidence in the form of a certificate given by Gramsevak, copy of public notice issued in daily newspaper ‘Anand Nagri’, dated 07/01/2022.          On the basis of the said evidence, the Judicial Magistrate (F.C.) Ghansawangi, had decided the said Criminal Application and had directed to register the entry of birth of the petitioner as 22/08/1993 in the concerned register on payment of prescribed fee. All these records were filed with the application which was forwarded to respondent No.2 - Education officer (Primary). The petitioner has approached this Court seeking a direction to the respondents, particularly respondent Nos.2 and 3, to direct them to correct the petitioner’s birth date in the school record. 4.      The issue of change of birth date in school record has been considered by the Full Bench Judgment of this Court, in the case of Janabai        d/o       Himmatrao Thakur     Vs.        The      State        of Maharashtra and Ors., reported in 2020 (1) ALL MR 360 (F.B.), wherein it has been held at paragraphs No.23, 24 as under :- “23.             We now come to the core issue in hand, namely : “(A) Whether an application seeking alteration, change or correction in the name, surname, date of birth, caste, or other entries entered in the General Register, including correction in spelling of name, surname, date of birth, caste, as recorded in the General Register, shall be entertained by or on behalf of the pupil who has left the school and the change in the aforesaid entries, is necessitated for the purposes like securing an admission to another educational institution and the School Leaving Certificate is relied upon as an evidence for name, surname, caste, date of birth, etc.” (emphasis suppied) The consideration of this issue depends upon the language of Clause 26.3 and 26.4 of the S.S. Code, which read as under: 1      No alteration in the date of          Application for change or birth or other entries in the        correction of date of birth, General Register, including          name, surname, caste etc. as correction of spelling shall be      entered      in    the       General allowed without the previous         Register shall be entertained permission of the appropriate        from or on behalf of a pupil authority.                           who is attending a school. (General principle)  (General Principle) 2      No such alteration in the Such application shall not figure of Date of Birth                  be entertained from or on shall, however, be allowed               behalf of a pupil, who has even with such permission                left the school, as the same after the student has left               amounts not only to a change secondary school.                        in the entries in the General (Limitation)  Register but also to a change in    the       School         Leaving 3.      This      shall         not    however   However, for the purposes preclude            corrections       of like      an      admission             to obvious mistakes, that is                another                educational the date of a particular                 institution         the        School month which does not exist               Leaving Certificate is relied in the calendar.                         upon as an evidence for (Exception )   name, surname, caste, date of birth etc., and hence in 4       Before giving sanction to The procedure to be followed correct spelling or the obvious in such cases is laid down in mistake in figures, the same Appendix Six.”                      (Procedure) shall be verified with the 24.              A look at the comparative       table above,           will demonstrate the marked differences between the language of Clauses 26.3 and 26.4 of the S.S. Code and will indicate that they overlap and also operate in different fields at the same time. While Clause 26.3, permits change of the entries in the General Register, it, at the same time restricts the time span and the nature of the change in respect of certain entries therein after a student/pupil has left school, which is indicated by the Third sentence of Clause 26.3.             The restriction is demonstrated by the absolute embargo cast upon any change in the date of birth, except for the obvious error as indicated therein, after a student has left school, as is indicated by the second sentence in Clause 26.3. It would not be out of context to point out here that Clause 26.3, does not speak of the School Leaving certificate at all.  In consonance with this the Second sentence of Clause 26.4, continues this prohibition, of not permitting any change at the behest of a pupil who has left school, as the same according to the language used not only amounts to a change in the entries in the General Register, but in the school leaving certificate also. The third sentence in Clause 26.4, however permits any change in the entries as recorded in the School Leaving Certificate, only so as to bring these entries in consonance with the existing entries in the General Register. Thus a conjoint reading of the various sentences in Clauses 26.3 and 26.4, with each other, leads us to the following conclusion : (a)           an application for alteration in the entries in the General Register is permissible, with the previous   permission    of     the   appropriate authority at any time when the pupil is attending the school. (b)          No application for alteration in the figure of date of birth is permissible, after the student has left secondary school, except correction in the nature of obvious mistakes as indicated in Clause 26.3 i.e. of a nature where the date of a particular month which does not exist in the calendar and likewise. (c)          An application for change in the spelling of the name, or for that matter in the name, surname or caste are errors which fall within the category of obvious mistakes, and thus can be made, even after the student has left school in light of the language of Clause 26.3. (d)      For the purposes like an admission to another educational     institution,    in     cases     of   obvious mistakes     as   prescribed        in   Clause      26.4,       a change/correction        in    the      school       leaving certificate, so as to make the entry consistent with the corresponding entries in the General Register of the School is permissible, which in fact is in consonance with (c) above.” 5.      At paragraph No.39 of the said Judgment of Janabai (Supra), this Court concluded as under :- “39.            This being the position, We answer Question Nos.(A) & (C) in the following terms : (a)      An application for alteration in the entries in the General Register is permissible, with the previous       permission       of      the    appropriate authority     at  any     time    when       the    pupil     is attending the school. (b)      No application for alteration in the figure of date of birth is permissible, after the student has left secondary school, except correction in the nature of 'obvious mistakes' as indicated in Clause 26.3 i.e. of a nature where the date of a particular month which does not exist in the calendar and likewise. (emphasis supplied) (c)      Thus, in light of the above, an application for change in the name, surname or caste, either due to reasons / cause unnoticed before or even occurring subsequently, being errors which fall within the category of 'obvious mistakes', can be made, even after the student has left school in light of the language of Clause 26.3 in the manner as indicated by Appendix Six in the forms as prescribed in the S.S. Code. (d)       For the purposes like admission to another educational institution, in cases of obvious mistakes       as   prescribed   in    Clause     26.4,      a change/correction        in   the     school      leaving certificate, so as to make the entry consistent with the corresponding entries in the General Register of the School is permissible, which in fact is in consonance with (c) above.” 6.      In the Judgment of Janabai (Supra), the Full Bench of this Court laid down the parameters under which the birth date in school entry can be altered. The Full Bench in the above case at paragraph No.39 has held that no application for alteration in the figure of the date of birth is permissible after the student has left secondary school, except correction in the nature of ‘obvious mistake’, where the date of a particular month which does not exist in the calendar and likewise. 7.      The petitioner had applied for correction of the birth date in the school record after he had left the school and as such in view of the aforesaid Judgment of Janabai (Supra), the petitioner’s prayer for change, which is not in the nature of ‘obvious mistake’, cannot be accepted. Thus, the present writ petition cannot be entertained. Hence, this petition is dismissed. Rule is discharged.
1.     This is a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of FIR No.0286/2019, under Section 498A/323/341/506/34 IPC, registered at Police Station Safdarjung Enclave, Delhi, and all proceedings emanating therefrom. 2.     The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner No.1 and respondent No.2 got married on 6.12.2014 according to Hindu rites and ceremonies and they lived together as wife and husband with each other. One baby girl was born out of the said wedlock on 2.9.2016. After the marriage, the disputes and differences arose between them and they started living separately since 15.10.2019. On 18.10.2019, the respondent No.2 got the above said FIR registered against the petitioners. 3.     Counsel for the petitioners submits that during the pendency of the trial, the parties have settled the matter amicably in terms of the Settlement/MOU dated 16.7.2021. Copy of the said settlement is placed on record. Accordingly, the petition under Section 13-B(2) of the HMA Act was allowed and the marriage of the petitioner No.1 and respondent No.2 was dissolved vide decree dated 29.09.2021 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, South Saket Courts. New Delhi. The copy of the decree is already on record. 4.      Petitioners are present in Court today through VC. Respondent No.2 is also present in Court today and she has been identified by the IO. I have interacted with the parties and they submit that they have settled their disputes. Respondent No.2 admits that she has settled the matter amicably with the petitioners. She further submits that the settlement/compromise has taken place voluntarily, without any force, pressure or coercion. Respondent No.2 submits that nothing remains to be adjudicated further between them and she has no objection if the FIR in question is quashed. 5.     It is submitted by the counsel for the petitioners that the visitation rights of the girl child have not been given to the petitioner-husband. He further submitted that at least respondent no.2 may be directed to sent e-mail every month informing about the well-being of the girl child. Respondent no.2 who is present though VC submitted that she has no objection to the same and she would be sending e-mail to the petitioner-husband every month keeping him informed about the well being of the girl child. 5.     Learned APP for the State submits that in view of the settlement, the State has no objection if the FIR in question be quashed. 6.     Keeping in view the above facts and circumstances, since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties, no useful purpose will be served by keeping the case pending. It will be nothing but abuse of the process of law. Consequentially, this petition is allowed and FIR No.0286/2019, under Section 498A/323/341/506/34 IPC, registered at Police Station Safdarjung Enclave, Delhi, and the proceedings emanating therefrom shall stand quashed. 7.     During the course of VC petitioner no. 5 has appeared through VC for his identification by the IO in his vest. The conduct of the petitioner no.5 in appearing before the Court in his vest is totally unacceptable. Even though the proceedings were being conducted through VC he should have appeared before the Court in proper clothes. Therefore, costs of Rs.10,000/- is imposed upon petitioner no.5 for his aforesaid conduct, to be deposited with the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within a week from today 7.     The present petition stands disposed of accordingly.
1.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad vide order dated 23.01.2020 passed in Special Appeal No.638 of 2012 by which the Division Bench of the High Court has dismissed the said appeal and has confirmed the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge by which the learned Single Judge has allowed the writ petition preferred by the Respondent No.4 herein and quashed and set aside the appointment of the appellants herein, the original Respondent Nos. 3 to 5 whose appointments have been quashed by the High Court have preferred the present appeal. 2.     The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as under: 2.1    In the judgeship of Moradabad in the year 1987, a competitive examination was held for filling up the post of English and Hindi Stenographers.      The appellants herein initially participated for the post of English Stenographers. Select list of English Stenographers (containing the names of the appellants herein) and Hindi Stenographers was prepared on 14.07.1987. However, since there were no vacancies in the judgeship for the post of English Stenographers, no appointments were given to the candidates in the select list of English Stenographers (including the appellants herein). As per Rule 14(3) of the Subordinate Civil Courts Ministerial Establishment Rules, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Rules, 1947’) select list was to remain valid for one year and the said select list dated 14.07.1987 came to an end on 13.07.1988. At the same time, Hindi Stenographers were given appointment as per the select list. However, since there were some leave vacancies of temporary nature in the post of Hindi Stenographers, the appellants were appointed on temporary basis against those leave vacancies, for a period of one month from 14.10.1987 to 15.11.1987. At this stage, it is required to be noted that in their respective appointment letters it was specifically stated that their appointments shall be terminated once the regular employees resume their duties. That thereafter fresh examination was conducted for the post of Hindi Stenographers on 24.09.1988. Pursuant thereto Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein were appointed on the substantive post of Hindi Stenographers as per merit and the select list. Therefore, as such Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein were appointed. As the appellants herein were appointed on leave vacancies of a temporary nature, their services were required to be terminated once the regular employees resume their duties.        However, representations were made by the appellants to the District Judge, Moradabad.          The District Judge, Moradabad forwarded his comments on the same to vide administrative order dated 22.05.1990 to District Judge, Moradabad directed that the approved list of ex-stenos and Hindi stenos dated 14.07.1987 be prepared and their names be arranged in the order of merit. At this stage, it is required to be noted that in the communication dated 22.05.1990, it was specifically mentioned that the appointment of the appellants was temporary and on leave vacancies.     It appears that thereafter a typing/speed test was conducted for the appellants for the post of Hindi Stenographers. The Officer-In-charge proceeded and conducted Hindi typing test of appellants and one more candidate on 29.05.1990.            In the said examination all the three appellants were found not qualified as per Rule 5(c) of the Rules, 1947 and their typing test was found less than the prescribed. Thus, the appellants failed in the speed test for the post   of  Hindi   Stenographers.         Despite   the  above   without communicating to the High Court that the appellants have failed the speed test, the District Judge, Moradabad terminated the services of Respondent Nos.1 to 3 herein who were selected after due process and in compliance of the Rules of 1947 and appointed the appellants on 05.06.1990, against the post held by Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein by terminating the services of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3. The appointment of the appellants and the termination of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 was challenged before the High Court by Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein. The learned Single Judge allowed the said writ petition and quashed and set aside the appointment of the appellants herein and set aside the orders of termination terminating the services of Respondent Nos.1 to 3 herein.         The special appeal against the order and judgment passed by the learned Single Judge has been dismissed by the Division Bench by impugned judgment and order dated 23.01.2020. Hence, the present appeal. 3.     Mr. Pardeep Gupta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has vehemently submitted in the facts and circumstances of the case more particularly when the appellants worked for almost 29 years and that too after the High Court of Allahabad vide its order dated 22.05.1990 approved the appointment of the appellants as Stenographers and directed the District Judge, Moradabad to issue the appointment letters and in accordance with the same the appointment letters dated 05.06.1990 were issued, it is not justified to quash their appointments. It is vehemently submitted that as such Rule 14(3) of the Rules, 1947 shall not be applicable to the recruitment list on merit under Rule 11 and can be made applicable only to the reserved category candidates under Rule 12. It is submitted that the High Court has erred in relying upon the said rule for setting aside the appointment of the appellants. It is further submitted that the High Court has erred in treating the appellants’ appointment against leave vacancy vide orders dated 14.10.1987, 15.10.1987 etc. and has failed to consider that the appellants have continuously worked for more than 30 years. The High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that though the appointment of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were approved on the basis of the selection list dated 29.11.1988, they were given appointment only in the year 2012, i.e., after a lapse of more than 24 years of select list dated 29.11.1988. It is submitted that therefore there is no justification to approve the appointment of the respondents when they were already become age barred, i.e., 50 years old. 4.     Making the above submissions, it is prayed to allow the present appeal and protect the services of the appellants. 5.     Present appeal is opposed by Ms. Preetika Dwivedi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent No.4 – High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. It is submitted that the appellants initially participated for the post of English Stenographers in the year 1987. However, since there were no vacancies, their names were placed on the select list on 14.07.1987. It is submitted that the select list was valid only for one year and came to an end on 13.07.1988, in view of the provisions contained in Rule 14(3) of the Rules, 1947.          It is submitted that no appointments were given to the appellants to the post of English Stenographers for want of vacancies for the post of English Stenographers. It is submitted that however in the year 1987, there were some leave vacancies of a temporary nature, in the post of Hindi Stenographers and therefore the appellants were appointed on temporary basis against leave vacancies for a period of one month from 14.10.1987 to 15.11.1987.           It is submitted that in the appointment letter it was specifically stated that their appointment shall be terminated once the regular employees resume their duties. It is submitted that thereafter fresh recruitment process was initiated and the fresh examination was conducted for the post of Hindi Stenographers on 24.09.1988 and pursuant thereto, Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were appointed. It is submitted that however thereafter the representations were made by the appellants to the District Judge, Moradabad which was forwarded to the High Court and the Deputy Registrar, High Court vide administrative order dated 22.05.1990 though noted that the appellants were appointed temporarily, directed that the approved list of ex-stenos and Hindi Stenos dated 14.07.1987 be prepared and their names be arranged in the order of merit. It is submitted that pursuant thereto a speed test was conducted for the appellants in accordance with the Rules and the appellants failed to achieve and possess the minimum speed required for the post of Hindi Stenographers, the fact which was not communicated to the High Court thereafter.         It is submitted that despite the above the District Judge, Moradabad continued the appellants and terminated the services of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 who were appointed after due process and in compliance to the Rules of 1947 and appointed the appellants against the post held by Respondent Nos.1 to 3. It is submitted that therefore, the High Court has rightly quashed the appointment of the appellants and has rightly quashed the termination of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3. 6.     It is submitted that the appellants are not entitled to any relief as they were never appointed to the post of Hindi Stenographers, after following due selection procedure. It is submitted that on the contrary the respondents were appointed after following proper selection procedure.       It is submitted that the appointment of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 was on the substantive sanctioned posts. It is submitted that there cannot be two persons working on one sanctioned post. It is submitted that therefore once the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were selected and appointed after following due selection procedure on the post of Hindi Stenographers and the appellants were appointed on leave vacancies, as a consequence the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 have to be appointed and the appellants have to give way to those who are duly selected after following selection procedure. It is submitted that therefore, the High Court has not committed any error in passing the impugned judgment and order. It is submitted that no interference of this Court in exercise of powers under Article 136 of the Constitution of India is called for. 7.     Dr. Ashutosh Garg, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 have supported the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge and confirmed by the Division Bench by adopting the submissions made by the counsel on behalf of the High Court. 8.     Heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length. 9.     At the outset, it is required to be noted that initially the appellants participated in the selection process for the post of English Stenographers in the year 1987. They never applied for the post of Hindi Stenographers in the year 1987.            Since there were no vacancies of English Stenographers in the District Court, Moradabad no appointments were made and appellants were not appointed on the post of English Stenographers of which they applied. However, they were placed on the select list on 14.07.1987. As per Rule 14(3) of the Rules, 1947 the validity of the select list was for one year and therefore, the said select list dated 14.07.1987 came to an end on 13.07.1988. Thereafter the appellants could not have claimed any appointment on the basis of the expired select list.        However, it appears that there were some leave vacancies of temporary nature in the post of Hindi Stenographers and therefore, the appellants were appointed purely on temporary basis on the said leave vacancies, for a period of one month from 14.10.1987 to 15.11.1987. At this stage, it is required to be noted that in the appointment letter itself it was stated that their appointment shall be terminated once the regular employees resume their duties. It is not in dispute that thereafter a fresh examination was conducted for the post of Hindi Stenographers on 24.09.1988 and Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were appointed. However, thereafter though the services of the appellants were required to be terminated on the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 being selected for the post of Hindi Stenographers, pursuant to the communication dated 22.05.1990 by the Deputy Registrar, High Court by which it was directed that the approved list of ex-stenos and Hindi Stenos dated 14.07.1987 be prepared and their names be arranged in the order of merit, and though the appellants failed to clear the speed test for the post of Hindi Stenographers as required as per Rule 5(c) of the Rules, 1947, the District Judge, Moradabad appointed the appellants and terminated the services of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3. The appointment of the appellants and the termination of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 has been rightly quashed and set aside by the High Court, firstly on the ground that in the year 1990 no direction could have been issued to make the appointment on the basis of the select list dated 14.07.1987 as the select list dated 14.07.1987 expired and came to an end on 13.07.1988; secondly, the appellants failed to clear/pass the speed test for the post of Hindi Stenographers; thirdly, the appellants were never appointed after following due procedure of selection, against which the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were selected and appointed pursuant to the fresh examination    which   was    conducted   for    the   post  of  Hindi Stenographers on 24.09.1988 and thereafter they were appointed after following due procedure of selection and that the appointment of the appellants in the year 1987 was against the leave vacancies and in the appointment order itself it was specifically mentioned that their appointment shall be terminated once the regular employees resume their duties. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the High Court has rightly quashed and set aside the appointment of the appellants and has rightly quashed and set aside the orders terminating the services of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 who were selected after due process and in accordance with the Rules, 1947. The submission on behalf of the appellants that the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were appointed in the year 2012 is factually incorrect as in the year 1988 itself Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were appointed and their services were terminated in the year 1990 by the District Judge, Moradabad and the appellants were appointed and thereafter pursuant to the interim orders passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were also accommodated in the year 2012. Therefore, as such the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 have suffered for the period between 1992 - 2012 for no fault of them and though they were selected and appointed after following due procedure of selection. In fact, the appellants have gained illegally and they were continued in service pursuant to the interim order of the High Court. Once the appellants continued on the aforementioned post pursuant to the interim order passed by the High Court and their appointment is subsequently held to be bad in law and not only that their continuation in service is also held to be bad in law, thereafter they cannot be permitted to submit that as they worked for a long time their services should be protected, though their appointments are not legally tenable. Once their appointments are held to be illegal and it is held that they have no right to continue on the post to be occupied by other eligible candidates, the necessary consequences shall follow. Once the Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are to be accommodated and/or appointed who were selected after due process and the appointment of the appellants were on leave vacancies with a specific condition in the appointment order that their appointment shall be terminated once the regular employees resume their duties, necessary consequences shall follow and the services of the appellants are to be terminated and/or put to an end. Unfortunately, it has so happened that after 2012 on the post of Hindi Stenographers the appellants as well as Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are working, which is not permissible. There cannot be appointment of two persons on one sanctioned post.           Otherwise, there will be financial burden on the State of two persons on one sanctioned post. Under the circumstances the prayer of the appellants to continue them in services and to pay them pensionary benefits etc. also cannot be granted. Appellants are not entitled to any relief. In fact, they are benefitted by continuing in the service after 1988 though their services were required to be put to an end after the fresh selection in the year 1988 and after the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were appointed after following due process and procedure as per Rules, In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the present appeal fails and the same deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Writ Petition is filed praying for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus, to direct the respondent No.5 to re-issue the Passport of the petitioner in Application Reference No.21-2003341220 dated 28.09.2021. 2. Heard either side. 3. The writ petitioner is an Indian Citizen. He is presently carrying on business in Malaysia. It is alleged that the petitioner was involved in a few Criminal Cases in the year 2017 and 2018 when he was in India. It is true that while one case is pending in F.I.R Stage, the other two are in CC Stage. 4. The petitioner's Passport is valid up to 07.07.2023. He had lost his Passport and he has also given a complaint before the local Police at Malaysia. Thereafter, the petitioner approached the Indian Embassy at Malaysia for re-issuance of the Passport. The Indian Embassy declined to do so by citing the involvement of the petitioner in the aforesaid Criminal 5. It is well settled that the pendency of the Criminal Case at the FIR stage, is not a bar for issuance of the Passport. It is true that if it has culminated in filing of the final report, permission of the Court for issuance of Passport will have to be obtained, but this requirement is applicable only if the petitioner wants to leave India. It cannot apply when the petitioner wants to come back to India. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in similar circumstances, a learned Judge of this Court, in the case of Rahul Ravindran Vs. Union of India and others, reported in 2021 (4) MLJ 289 = MANU/TN/4595/2021, had taken favourable view and disposed of the writ petition on certain directions. I am of the view that this writ petition can also be disposed of with similar directions. 6. Accordingly, this Writ Petition stands disposed of with the (a)   The  petitioner   is  directed   to   submit    a representation to the Indian Embassy at Malaysia enclosing a certified/web-copy of this order made in this writ petition; (b) Immediately on receipt of such representation, the Passport of the petitioner shall be re-issued/renewed for a (c) On such re-issuance/renewal, the petitioner shall come over to India and take immediate steps to participate in the Criminal proceedings and work out his remedy and defend (d) The petitioner shall also file a memo before the concerned Court, where the Criminal case is pending and bring to the notice of the said Court, the orders passed in this writ (e) If in case the criminal case does not come to an end within the period for which the Passport has been re- issued/renewed,     the   petitioner shall   get   the   necessary permission only from the concerned Court in line with the notification issued by the Government of India through the Ministry of External Affairs in G.S.R.298(E) dated 14.04.1976 7. However, there shall be no orders as to costs. Ministry of External affairs, Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs, 3.The High Commission of India,

Nos.9919, 9922, 9925, 9937 and 9939 of 2021 1.The State of Tamil Nadu, ...Appellants in W.A.Nos.1573,1574 and 1577 of 2021 ...Appellants in W.A.Nos.1574 and 1577 of 2021 Common Prayer: The Writ Appeal is filed under Clause 15 of Letters Patent praying to set aside the common order dated 18.12.2020 passed in W.P.Nos.8916, 9555 and 9559 of 2019. [Order of the Court was made by S.VAIDYANATHAN,J. and N.MALA,J.] The issues raised in all the writ appeals are common. Therefore all the three writ appeals are taken up together and disposed by this common order. The individual facts of each case is dealt with separately as there are slight variations in the service particulars of the respondent/writ petitioners. 2. Brief Facts in W.A. No. 1573 of 2021: The respondent was appointed as secondary grade teacher on 07.12.1998 in the second respondent school which is an aided elementary school governed by Tamil Nadu Private School Regulation Act. The respondent was appointed against sanctioned vacancy in view of the resignation of the earlier incumbent on 31.07.1997. The proposal for approval of the respondents appointment was rejected by the District Elementary Educational officer, the 3rd appellant herein, on the ground that the respondents appointment was in violation of G.O.Ms.No.559 dated 11.07.1995 which prohibited the appointment of higher qualified persons to The respondent was appointed as a secondary grade teacher on 05.03.2001 in the second respondent school which is an aided elementary school governed by Tamil Nadu Private School Regulation Act. The respondent was appointed against the sanctioned vacancy which arose in view of the resignation of the earlier incumbent on 05.04.1998. Soon after the appointment of the respondent a proposal was sent for approval of her appointment to the third appellant for approval. The proposal was rejected by the 3rd Appellant on the ground that her appointment was in violation of G.O.Ms.No.559 dated 11.07.1995 which prohibited the appointment of higher qualified persons to the post of secondary grade teacher. 4. Brief Facts in W.A. No. 1577 of 2021: The respondent was appointed as a secondary grade teacher on 25.11.1998 in the second respondent school which is an aided elementary school governed by Tamil Nadu Private School Regulation Act. The respondent was appointed against the sanctioned vacancy which arose in view of the resignation of the earlier incumbent on 03.10.1996. Soon after the appointment of the respondent a proposal was sent for approval of her appointment to the third appellant. The proposal was rejected by the 3rd appellant on the ground that her appointment was in violation of G.O.Ms.No.559 dated 11.07.1995 which prohibited the appointment of higher qualified persons to the post of secondary grade teacher. 5. The further facts apart from the above brief facts are as follows: The Government of Tamil Nadu passed G.O.Ms.No.559                       School Education Department dated 11.07.1995 prohibiting the appointment of graduate teachers in secondary grade vacancy. The schools in question appointed the respondents on the dates mentioned supra, which was against G.O.Ms. 559 dated 11.07.1995. The appellants therefore did not approve the appointment of the respondents. Teachers who were affected by Go.Ms.No.559 dated 11.07.1995 approached the Hon'ble Court in W.P. No. 6388 of 1993 and W.A Nos. 991 to 998 of 1998 and the Hon'ble Division Bench by order dated 29.06.2001 upheld the validity of the said G.O with a direction to approve the appointments made from 11.07.1995 to 19.05.1998. Consequent to the judgment of this Hon'ble Court the Government passed G.O.Ms.No.155 School Education Department dated 03.10.2002 with a direction to approve the appointment up to 19.05.1998, subject to the completion of one month Child Psychology Training by the said teachers. In pursuance to G.O.Ms.No. 155 dated 03.10.2002 the teachers covered under the said G.O underwent one month Child Psychology Training and on completion of the training their appointments were approved in the regular time scale of pay in the year 2003. 6.The respondents and 19 similarly placed teachers who were not considered for extension of benefits under G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 on the ground that their appointments were beyond the cut off date of 19.05.1998 through an association which espoused their cause submitted a memorandum to the Government seeking extension of benefit of G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 in respect of the teachers who were appointed upto the order of the Hon'ble Division Bench Judgment dated 29.06.2001. The Government considered the memorandum favourably and issued G.O.Ms.No.150 dated 02.07.2007 extending the benefits of G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 to the respondents and 19 similarly placed teachers. In pursuance of G.O.Ms.No.150 of 02.07.2007 the Government approved the appointments of the teachers covered under the said G.O. on completion of Child Psychology Training vide proceeding dated 04.12.2007 with effect from 7.As G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 not only covered the approval of the secondary grade teachers with higher qualification but also contained certain provisions which contemplated recovery of payments from the teachers the aggrieved teachers filed several cases in W.A.Nos. 249, 282 and 448 to 452 of 2002 and 80 of 2004 and W.P.No. 42067 batch. The Hon'ble Division Bench vide the Judgment dated 02.04.2004 reported in 2004(2) Law Weekly 591 while setting aside a part of the Government order which directed the recovery from the teachers held that the past services however shall be counted for pension. The said order of the Hon'ble Division Bench was taken up by way of appeal to the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 5012 of 2006 and the same was dismissed. Meanwhile the Government implemented the New Contributory Pension scheme for those who joined Government service on or after 01.04.2003 vide G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004. The secondary grade teachers who were appointed between the period from 11.07.1995 to 19.05.1998 and who were covered by G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 filed writ petitions in W.P.Nos 26933 and 26934 of 2007, W.P. (MD) Nos. 10447 and 5174 of 2008, 4537 of 2009, 1375 of 2010, 12280 to 12282 of 2010 before this Hon'ble Court praying for direction to count their past services prior to completion of Child Psychology Training for the purpose of pensionary benefits. This Hon'ble Court in the said writ petitions held that the petitioners therein, were to be extended the pension scheme prevailing prior to 01.04.2003 and that they would not be covered by G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004. In pursuance of the said orders of the Hon'ble Court, the Government issued G.O.Ms.No.413 dated 04.11.2010 extending the Old Pension Scheme to the secondary grade teachers appointed between 11.07.1995 to 19.05.1998 and whose services were regularised as per G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 while clarifying that the New Pension Scheme in G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004 would not apply to them. 8.It is the case of the respondents that they are similarly placed to the teachers covered under G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 and even the Government had passed G.O.Ms.No.150 dated 02.07.2007 extending the benefit of G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 to the respondents and 19 others and as much the respondents who were appointed as secondary grade teachers with effect from 07.12.1998, 05.03.2001 and 25.11.1998 were entitled to the benefit of counting of past services for pensionary benefits. In this regard the first respondent in W.A. No. 1574 and W.A. No. 1577 earlier filed writ petitions in W.P.No. 30137 and 30143 of 2010 and the Hon'ble Court vide order dated 29.12.2010 directed the appellants to consider the representation of the respondents and to pass appropriate orders extending the Old Pension Scheme as directed in the order. The respondents further relied on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Court passed in the case of Shri. Jayapal and Shri. Sampasivam, wherein the Hon'ble Court allowed the counting of past service from 26.02.1999 to 08.11.2007 for the purpose of pensionary benefits on par with the secondary grade teachers who were appointed prior to 01.04.2003. The Government preferred an appeal against the said order which was dismissed on the ground of limitation. Thereafter on threat of contempt G.O.Ms. 34 dated 15.02.2017 was passed extending the benefit of the Old Pension Scheme to the said two persons only, even though similar orders were passed in favour of the respondents also. The respondents therefore filed the present writ petitions claiming benefit of G.O.Ms.No.34 dated 15.02.2017. 9.The appellants filed counter affidavit disputing the entitlement of the respondents/writ petitioners to the relief claimed in the writ petition. According to the appellants, as the approval of appointment of the respondents was issued on 09.11.2007 the respondents were not entitled to the benefit of Old Pension Scheme. The appellants submitted that the counting of past service for the purpose of pension would take effect from the date of approval of regular appointment and not from the date of initial appointment. The appellants further relied on the Judgement of this Hon'ble Court dated 08.02.2017 in W.P.(MD).No. 2356 of 2011 and order dated 21.03.2018 in W.P. No. 74 of 2015 and 957 of 2016 in support of their case. 10.The learned Judge after hearing the arguments of the respective counsels and on perusal of the records found favour with the respondents. The appellants aggrieved by the order of the learned Single Judge have preferred the above appeal. 11.The factual narratives stated above are not denied. The pivotal issue raised in the factual matrix of the case is whether the respondents are entitled for pensionary benefits under the Old Pension Scheme or under the New Pension Scheme notified in G.O.Ms.No. 430 dated 06.08.2004. 12.The learned Government Advocate submitted that as the respondents appointments were approved only after the completion of the Child Psychology Training programme, the date of appointment should be reckoned from the date of the approval of the appointment dated 09.11.2007 and not from the date of initial appointment which is 07.12.1998, 05.03.2001 and 25.11.1998. The learned Government Advocate further submitted that the respondents would be covered by G.O.Ms.No. 430 dated 06.08.2004 under which the New Pension Scheme was introduced with effect from 01.04.2003. The learned Government Advocate submitted that as the respondents appointments were approved after 01.04.2003 they would be covered by the New Pension Scheme which is Contributory Pension Scheme and not under the Old Pension Scheme. The learned Government Advocate relied on the Judgment of this Hon'ble Court in W.P.(MD). 2356 of 2011 dated 08.02.2017 and the W.A.No. 74 and 957 of 2016 dated 21.03.2018 in support of his submissions. 13.Per contra, the counsel for the respondents submitted that the date for determining the entitlement to the Old Pension Scheme would be the date of initial appointment and not the date of approval of appointment as contended by the appellants. The learned counsel further submitted that, in view of the orders passed by this Hon'ble Court in their favour in W.P.No. 30137 of 2010 and 30143 of 2010 dated 29.12.2010, the appellants are bound to extend the benefit of Old Pension Scheme to them. The respondents counsel further submitted that when similarly placed Secondary Grade teachers were extended the benefit of the Old Pension Scheme vide G.O.Ms.No. 34 dated 15.02.2017, the failure to extend the same benefit to the respondents is discriminatory and violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The learned counsel for the respondents therefore prayed that the writ appeal may be dismissed and the order of the learned Single Judge may be affirmed. 14.We have heard the learned counsel for both sides and we have perused the records. 15.The genesis of the issue relates back to the issuance of G.O.Ms. No.559 dated 11.07.1985, wherein the Government directed not to approve the appointment of higher qualified persons to the post of Secondary Grade teachers. The said Government order was challenged before this Hon'ble Court in W.A.Nos. 991 to 998 of 1998 and the Hon'ble Division Bench was pleased to uphold the G.O with a direction to the Government to consider the approval of appointments made between 11.07.1995 and 19.05.1998. In pursuance and in compliance of the above said Division Bench order the appellants issued G.O.Ms.No. 155 dated 03.10.2002 giving permission for approval for B.T teachers who were appointed as Secondary Grade teachers during the period from 11.07.1995 to 19.05.1998, subject to their undergoing one month Child Psychology Training. The teachers covered under G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 on completion of Child Psychology Training were granted approval of appointment with effect from 02.06.2003 in the regular time scale of pay. The respondents as also 19 other secondary grade teachers who were appointed subsequent to the cut off date of 19.05.1998 were not covered by G.O.Ms.No. 155 dated 03.10.2002. A representation was given by the President of Tamil Nadu recognised aided School Managers Association requesting for extension of benefit of G.O.Ms. 155 dated 03.10.2002 to the teachers appointed till the order of the Hon'ble Division Bench dated 29.06.2001. The Government accepted the representation and issued G.O.Ms.No. 150 dated 02.07.2007 extending the benefits of G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 to the 22 teachers who were appointed subsequent to the cut off date of 19.05.1998 and before the order of the Hon'ble Division Bench dated 29.06.2001. All the 22 teachers who were covered by G.O.Ms.No.150 dated 02.07.2007 completed their Child Psychology Training and thereafter their appointments were approved by the third appellant vide proceeding dated 05.06.2008 with effect from 09.11.2007. 16.The secondary grade teachers who were covered under G.O.Ms.No. 155 dated 03.10.2002 challenged certain provisions of the said G.O in W.A.Nos. 249, 282, 448, 452 of 2002 and 80 of 2004 before this Hon'ble Court. The Hon'ble Divison bench vide order dated 02.04.2004 was pleased to set aside para 7 of the G.O which directed the recovery from the teachers. The G.O was confirmed with respect to other aspects, except that the Government was directed to consider the past service of the teachers for the purpose of pensionary benefits. After the Judgement of the Hon'ble Division Bench, the Government passed G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004 introducing New Pension Scheme and the cut off date for New Pension Scheme was given as 01.04.2003. The teachers covered under GO.Ms.No. 155 dated 03.10.2002 filed writ petitions before this Hon'ble Court praying for a direction to count their past services prior to completion of Child Psychology Training for pensionary benefits. This Hon'ble Court in the said writ petitions ordered that the petitioners therein would be entitled to the pension scheme in force prior to 01.04.2003 and that they would not be governed by G.O.Ms.No. 430 dated 06.08.2004. The Government passed G.O.Ms.Ms.413 dated 04.11.2010 implementing the above said order of the Hon'ble Court. 17.One Mr.Jayapal and Mr.Sampasivam, secondary grade teachers whose appointments were approved on completion of training with effect from 09.11.2007 filed writ petitions in W.P.No.29163 and 29164 of 2010 seeking the benefit of the Old Pension Scheme by counting their service from 26.02.1999 to 08.11.2000 (i.e) their date of appointment. This Hon'ble Court passed a common order on 22.12.2010 ordering that they would be entitled to the pension scheme applicable to teachers prior to 01.04.2003 and they would not be governed by G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004. The appellants preferred an appeal before this Hon'ble Court against the said order and the same was dismissed on the ground of delay. Thereafter the appellants on threat of contempt passed G.O.Ms.No34 dated 15.02.2017 implementing the Old Pension Scheme to Mr.Jayapal and 18.The main ground on which the appellants sought to deny the respondents, the relief claimed by them was that their appointments were approved with effect from 09.11.2007 and therefore they would not be covered by the Old Pension Scheme, but would be covered only, under the New Pension Scheme introduced vide G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004. The appellants in this regard relied on two Judgments of this Hon'ble Court in W.P.(MD).No. 2356 of 2011 dated 08.02.2017 and W.A.No. 74 of 2015 and 957 of 2016 dated 21.03.2018 in support of their submissions. 19.We are not inclined to accept the submissions of the appellant. The Hon'ble Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court in V.Vasanthi Vs. State of Tamil Nadu 2019(4) CTC 865 held that the relevant date for claiming Old Pension Scheme is the date of actual appointment and not the date of approval of appointment. The relevant para from the Hon'ble Division Bench Judgment in Vasanthi's case is extracted hereunder: “A careful perusal of the above observation made in the said Pallivasal Primary School case would show that even though approval of the Appointment of the Teacher, who has undergone Child Psychology Training, will take effect only on completion of such training the past service rendered by such Teacher i.e., service rendered before the completion of such training, is bound to be counted for Pension. In other words, the service period of such teacher commences from the date of the Appointment and not from the date of approval, even though the Monetary benefits start to accrue only from the date of completion of the training. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the date of Appointment is not altered and remain to be the same. Therefore, the date of Approval of Appointment of the Writ Petitioner cannot be construed as the date relevant for considering the applicability of the Pension Scheme and on the other hand, it is the original date on which the Writ Petitioner got appointed that matters for considering as to whether the Writ Petitioner is governed under the Old Pension Scheme or not. At this juncture, it is relevant to note that in G.O.Ms.No.259, Finance (Pension) Department, dated 06.08.2003, a Proviso to Rule 2 of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rule 1978, was introduced by way of amendment, wherein and whereby, it is contemplated that the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 shall not apply to Government Servants “appointed” on or after 1st April 2003 to services and posts. The word “appointed” referred in the said Proviso cannot be construed to mean approval of such Appointment. Accordingly, the Writ Appeal is allowed and the Order of the Writ Court is set aside. Consequently, the Writ Petition filed by the Petitioner/Appellant is allowed and the Respondents are directed to permit the Petitioner to continue under the Old Pension Scheme, namely, Teacher Provident Fund The said Judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench squarely covers the issue raised before us. 20.We are of the view that the Judgment relied on by the appellants are not applicable to the facts of the present case. The Judgment passed in W.P.2356 of 2011 dated 08.02.2017 was by a learned Single Judge of this Hon'ble Court and the same was also long prior to the Division Bench Judgment in Vasanthi's case. As regards the other Judgment relied by the appellants dated 21.03.2018 we find that the issue therein was with reference to disbursement of salary from the date of original appointment and the Hon'ble Division Bench in the light of the explicit condition contained in G.O.Ms.No.155 dated 03.10.2002 held that the disbursement of salary from the date of original appointment order could not be sustained as the G.O specifically stated that the salary would be paid from the date of completion of training, after approving the said appointment. The Hon'ble Division Bench Judgment is with reference to disbursement of salary and therefore has no relevance to the present issue. 21.We are therefore of the view that the issue raised in this writ appeal is covered by the Judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in V.Vasanthi's case. The contention of the respondent that the relevant date would be the date of approval of appointment cannot be countenanced and hence, the same stands rejected. 22.It is pertinent to note here that two of the respondents in W.A.No.1574 and 1577 earlier filed writ petitions in W.P.No. 30137 of 2010 and 30143 of 2010 wherein the learned Single Judge of this Hon'ble Court was pleased to pass the “In view of the said submission, it is ordered that the petitioners are to be extended the Pension Scheme applicable to the Teachers appointed prior to 01.04.2003 and they are not   governed     under   G.O.Ms.No.430     Finance(Pension) Department date 06.08.2004. If the pensionary contributions if any, payable by the petitioners as per Tamil Nadu Pension Rules 1978 are not paid till date by the petitioners, it is open to the respondents to claim the same from the petitioners. The writ petitions are ordered in the above terms. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed. No costs. In view of the same, the respondents 1 to 3 are directed to consider    the   representation  of   the  petitioner     dated 24.12.2010 in the light of the above said paragraphs and pass appropriate order extending the Pension Scheme not as per G.O.Ms.No.430 Finance(Pension) Department dated 06.08.2004 but in terms of paragraph No.9 of the above said order and such order shall be passed within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order” Inspite of the said orders, the appellants did not consider the respondents claim. What is more appalling is that the second appellant in his proceedings dated 21.03.2016 recommended that the benefit of G.O.Ms.No.413 can be extended to the 22 Secondary Grade teachers covered under G.O.Ms.No.150 dated 02.07.2007 inspite of such recommendation the appellants restricted G.O.Ms.No.34 dated 15.02.2017 to the said two persons thereby driving the respondents to this 2 nd round of litigation. In the light of the above facts we find absolutely no infirmity in the orders by the learned Single Judge and hence the same is confirmed. In fine the Writ Appeals are dismissed. Four months time is granted for the appellants to extend their benefits to the writ petitioners, if not already extended. PRE-DELIVERY JUDGMENT IN W.A.Nos. 1573, 1574 and 1577 of 2021 C.M.P. Nos.9919, 9922, 9925, 9937 and 9939 of 2021
1.      The  present   appeals   challenge    the  judgment  and order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Madras dated 7th December, 2011 thereby partly allowing Criminal Appeal No.192 of 2008            filed by the State and Criminal Revision Case No. 252 of 2008 filed by the first informant-wife. 2.      The  appellant   No.1   had   married   PW-1-S.Beula  on 04.12.2003.    It appears that soon after marriage disputes arose    between   the  parties    and   they  started  residing separately.       PW-1-wife   filed    a  complaint  before  the Deputy    Superintendent   of   Police,    Kanyakumari.    After investigation, the charge sheet came to be filed for the offences punishable under Section 498-A IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 against the four accused, namely, accused No.1-husband, accused No.2- mother-in-law,   accused   No.3-father   in  law  and  accused No.4-brother-in-law.    The trial was conducted before the Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu.        On the conclusion of the  trial,  the  learned   trial  Judge   acquitted  all   the accused persons of all the offences charged with. 3.    Against the said order, the State filed an appeal and PW-1-Wife also filed a Revision Petition before the High Court.      The appeal was partly allowed.         By the impugned  judgment and    order, the    acquittal of   accused Nos. 1 to 3 was set aside and they were convicted for the offences punishable under Section 498-A IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. 4.    Being aggrieved thereby, the present appeals. 5.    Mr.  S.Nagamuthu,   learned   senior   counsel  for   the appellants submits that the marriage between the parties has been held to be null and void by the judgment of the High  Court   of  Madras,   Madurai   Bench   by  order   dated 25.02.2021.    He therefore submits that in view of the judgment of this Court in the case of Shivcharan Lal Verma v. State of Madhya Pradesh reported in (2007) 15 SCC 369, the conviction under Section 498-A IPC would not be sustainable. 6.    Dr. Joseph Aristotle, learned counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu and Mr. Vinodh Kanna, learned counsel for the wife, vehemently oppose the appeals.       It is submitted that,  even  if  it  is   held   that  the   conviction   under Section  498-A  IPC   is  not  sustainable,     the  conviction under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act would still remain. 7.    Undisputedly,   the  marriage   between    the  appellant No.1 and PW-1 has been found to be null and void.            As such the conviction under Section 498-A IPC would not be sustainable in view of the judgment of this Court in the case Shivcharan Lal Verma's case supra.          So far as the conviction   under   Sections     3  and   4   of    the  Dowry Prohibition Act is concerned, the learned trial Judge by an elaborate reasoning, arrived at after appreciation of evidence, has found that the prosecution has failed to prove   the  case   beyond    reasonable     doubt.      In  an appeal/revision, the High court could have set aside the order of acquittal only if the findings as recorded by the trial Court were perverse or impossible. 8.    We have perused the judgment of the learned trial Judge.   We do not notice any perversity in the approach adopted by the learned trial Judge.        The view taken by the trial Court also cannot said to be impossible. 9.    In that view of the matter, the High Court ought not to have interfered with the well reasoned judgment of the trial Judge. 10.   The appeals are, therefore, allowed. 11.   The  judgment  and  order   dated  7th  December,  2011 passed by the High Court is quashed and set aside and the judgment of the trial Court is affirmed. 12.   The appellants are acquitted of the charges. 13.   The bail bonds shall stand discharged. In  view  of  the  order   passed  in  Criminal  Appeal Nos.1404-1405 of 2012, these appeals are disposed of. Date : 09-02-2023 These appeals were called on for hearing today. UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following Criminal Appeal Nos.1404-1405 of 2012 are allowed and Criminal Appeal Nos.1408-1409 of 2012 are disposed of in terms of the signed order. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed (Signed order is placed on the file)
2.      By way of present writ-application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India the writ-applicant has prayed for he following reliefs :- “(a)      Be pleased to direct the respondent no. 1 bank release the charge over the property in question and subsequently be pleased to direct to handover the original title documents of the property in question immediately and forthwith. (b)       Pending hearing, admission and final disposal, the respondent no. 1 bank is required to be RESTRAINED from taking any coercive actions against the property in question. (c)       To grant any other appropriate and just relief/s;” 3.      Brief facts for the adjudication of the present writ- application are stated thus :- 3.1       It is the case of the writ-applicant that the respondent No.2 had availed the financial assistance from the respondent No.1 – Bank and while availing the financial assistance, the respondent No.2 had mortgaged the property in question in favour of the respondent No.1 Bank. 3.2     It appears that the respondent No.2 failed to repay the financial assistance and hence the respondent No.1 Bank classified      the   account   of    the     respondent   No.2       as      Non- 3.3    In view of above, the respondent No.1 Bank was in the process to sell the mortgaged property i.e. property in question and, therefore, the writ-applicant approached the respondent No.1 bank to purchase the property in question for an amount of Rs.2.50 crores with consent of the respondent No.2. 3.4    The      respondent   No.1     Bank      gave    no     objection           in purchasing the property for an amount of Rs.2.50 crores. The respondent No.2 on 21.11.2017 executed an agreement to sale in favour of the writ-applicant for the property in question. The writ-applicant deposited the entire amount of Rs.2.50 crores with the respondent No.1 Bank which was accepted by the respondent No.1 bank and also encashed by the respondent No.1 Bank in the account of the respondent No.2. 3.5    It appears that though the respondent No.1 bank had received      the   entire  amount      of    Rs.2.50   crores       from        the purchaser through the respondent No.2, the respondent No.1 Bank declined to issue certificate for releasing the charge over the property and also did not hand over the original title documents of the property. 3.6      The writ-applicant addressed several reminders to the respondent No.1 Bank to release the property in question. However,        the  writ-applicant     also   issued    legal     notice         on 12.9.2019, but the respondent No.1 Bank did not release the original documents or release the charge over the property and, therefore, the writ-applicant herein is constrained to approach this Court by filing the present writ-application. Submissions on behalf of the writ-applicant :- 4.       Mr. S. S. Iyer, the learned advocate appearing for the writ-applicant submitted that the writ-applicant is neither borrower nor the guarantor of the loan transaction which has taken place between the respondents No.1 and 2 and the writ- applicant is not concerned with the proceedings initiated by the respondent No.1 Bank against the respondent No.2 for recovery of any amount due and payable by the respondent 4.1       Mr. Iyer, the learned advocate submitted that the respondent No.1 Bank had given no objection for sale of the property in question to the writ-applicant for an amount of Rs.2.50 crores by communication dated 20.11.2017 and assured the release of property upon receipt of the aforesaid amount and, therefore, it is now not open for the respondent No.1 Bank in refraining from releasing the property from the charge. 4.2      Mr. Iyer, the learned advocate placed reliance on the decision dated 26.11.2018 in the Special Civil Application No.13890 of 2017 reported in (2020) 1 GLH 8. Relying on the aforesaid decision Mr. Iyer, the learned advocate submitted that said issue is no longer res integra and that the prayers as prayed for by the writ-applicant in the present writ-application be allowed. Submissions on behalf of the respondent No.1 – Bank :- 5.      Mr. Vishwas K. Shah, the learned advocate appearing for the respondent No.1 Bank submitted that the Bank is not in a position to release the charge on the aforesaid property as per the banking norms for releasing the mortgaged property. All direct/indirect liability should be closed and the in the case on hand the proprietor of the respondent No.2 i.e. Shankar Ramkumar Mundra had given guarantee in another account known as M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines which is also NPA and the said liability is      outstanding.     Mr.   Shah,    the learned advocate submitted that in view of above there is indirect liability of the respondent No.2 Vinayak Fabrics to the tune of Rs.85.34 lacs. The writ-applicant therefore cannot be absolved from the aforesaid charge. 6.     It is apposite to refer to the law as laid down by this Court       in the decision dated 26.11.2018 rendered in the Special Civil Application No.13890 of 2017, paragraphs 48 to “48. The case of the respondent Bank as it emerges from the materials on record, more particularly, the reply of the Bank to the notice issued by the writ-applicants is that they have a right to retain the title deeds of the property delivered to them in the normal course of business transaction by exercising the general lien under Section 171 of the Act and, therefore, they are bound to retain the same till the liability in the other account, i.e. M/s.Radheshyam Fibres Private Limited, where the writ-applicant nos.2 and 3 are guarantors, is discharged. 49. In the course of hearing of this matter, the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Syndicate Bank v. Vijaya Kumar and others, reported in 1992(2) SCC 331 was also looked into. 50. As noticed above, Section 171 of the Act states that the bankers like the respondent Bank, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, retain as security for a general balance account, any goods bailed to them. Therefore, what is required to be seen in the instant case is, whether there is any contract to the contrary, which prevents the bank from exercising their general lien and as to whether any goods have been bailed to them. It cannot be disputed that the title deeds in question were not bailed to the Bank by the writ-applicants at any point of time. Further, indisputably, the property in question of which the title deeds are in possession of the Bank was offered by the writ-applicants to cover their liability in respect of the loans which they had borrowed in the account of M/s.Radheshyam       Spinning Mill         Private  Limited.      There         is nothing on record to indicate that the writ-applicants herein had given any authorization to the Bank to hold the title deeds of the mortgaged property given to secure the loan transaction for M/s. Radheshyam Spinning Mill Private Limited for the purpose of any other loan availed in any other branch by M/s. Radheshyam Fibres Private Limited, in which the writ-applicant nos.2 and 3 stood as guarantors. Thus, the issue boils down to the question as to whether there is any contract to the contrary, which prevents the Bank from exercising its general lien under Section 171 of the Act. 51. In Chitty on Contracts, 29th Edition (2004) - Volume-II, Page 496 on Banker's Lien, it is stated as follows : ".....The   most   frequent        example    of     circumstances inconsistent with the general lien is in the case of a deposit expressed to cover an advance for a specified purpose. However, once the original purpose has been fulfilled by repayment of the specified advance, if a customer knowingly permits the banker to retain the security, a general lien may ultimately be implied and its protection then claimed in respect of other advances." 52. In the case on hand, the writ-applicants have admittedly deposited the title deeds of the property to secure a loan transaction availed in respect of M/s.Radheshyam Spinning Mill Private Limited. This fact is apparent from the reply of the Bank itself which has been referred to in the earlier part of the judgment. In such circumstances, I have no hesitation to hold that this contract/mortgage had been created by the writapplicants for a specific purpose and for a specific loan and the contract was self-contained and the terms and conditions were binding upon both, the borrowers as well as the Bank. To put it in other words, the deposit of title deeds, by which the mortgage was created by the writ-applicants, was for a specific purpose to cover an advance for a specific loan. When such is the situation, the borrower, having deposited the title deeds in order to secure a specific transaction, the Bank cannot take a stance that they could hold the title deeds for a balance due in a different loan amount, i.e. with respect of M/ s. Radheshyam Fibres Private Limited, where the writ-applicant nos.2 and 3 may be guarantors. Further, the language of Section 171 of the Act is explicit to the fact that the bankers are entitled to retain as a security for a 'general balance account'. Indisputably, it is not the case of the respondent Bank that the amount which is now said to be due on account of the borrowings of M/s.Radheshyam Fibres Private Limited is a general balance account of the writ-applicants.” 6.1    The aforesaid judgment was carried in Appeal which came to be confirmed by the Hon’ble Division Bench and the same is reported in (2020) 1 GLH 8, para-39 reads thus :- “39.        Thus, for all the reasons recorded above, we do not find any infirmity in the order of the learned Single Judge directing the appellant Bank to return the title-deeds forthwith and also to discharge the charge recorded in the records of the Registrar      of  Companies.   The      appeal  lacks   merit       and       is accordingly dismissed. Consequently, Civil Application No.1 of 2019 stands disposed of.” 6.2    In the case of Pravin Cotton Pvt. Ltd., vs. Branch 12 to 15 reads thus :- “12. Having considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the respective parties, what is evident is that the letter of sanction dated 1.10.2015 was in the context of the petitioner      Company   to   the      Cash  Credit    Hypothecation whereby certain properties were agreed to be mortgaged by the Company i.e. Parvin Cotton Pvt. Ltd. and the details of the securities have been mentioned in the sanctioned letter at page No.33. List shows the properties of Parvin Cotton Pvt. Ltd. and, therefore, the stand of the Bank that they are not willing to release the properties of Parvin Cotton Pvt. Ltd. itself is not proper. What is evident from the record is that the property is mortgaged by two separate corporates i.e. 13.      I am inclined to accept the submission of Mr.Puj as far as the contention of objecting to the release of such dues on the ground of having sanctioned Letter of Guarantee of General lien and General Undertaking at page No.118. Such undertaking was given by the Directors of Parvin Exim Pvt. Ltd. at page No.118 and though they may be the Directors of the Company, one cannot lose sight of the fact that what binds Parvin Exim Pvt. Ltd., would not bind Parvin Cotton Pvt. Ltd. I am supported by the view taken by this Court in the case of Radheshyam Spinning Mill Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) which has extensively considered Section 171 of the Contract Act and relied on a Division Bench Judgment and categorically considered the case on similar facts and the prayers made in the context of facts therein and directed the Bank to release the title deeds of the mortgaged property pertaining to a legal entity namely; one M/s.Radheshyam Spinning Mill Pvt. Ltd. Facts on hand would also indicate similar case because there were common Directors / Promoters, and that the properties by virtue of the Equitable Mortgage was made of the petitioner company, the Bank cannot refuse to release mortgage deeds of the properties belonging to Parvin Cotton Pvt. Ltd. merely because some of the Directors / Promoters are also part of Parvin Exim Pvt. Ltd. 14.      Pending the petition, the petitioner Company has filed an undertaking dated 21.1.2019 stating that they are willing to clear the outstanding dues if the Court gives a direction to the Bank to return the documents in respect of the properties belonging to the petitioner which are enlisted in the sanctioned letter dated 1.10.2015. In fact, Mr.Puj has pointed out that in order to show bonafide of their will to stand by the proposal on 20.9.2019, the petitioner company has already deposited an amount of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees fifty lacs only) with the Bank. 15.        Considering the request made by the petitioner for release of the title deeds of the documents in respect to the properties belonging to the petitioner, it is directed that in the event, the petitioner presents before the Bank buyers of the properties which they have offered for sale to which the Bank responded on 19.3.2018 and once the buyer deposits the entire outstanding dues of the petitioner by way of the sale consideration of such properties, the Bank shall release the documents in respect of such properties within a period of two weeks thereafter and shall also give `No Objection Certificate' to that effect. Thereby, the petition is allowed in terms of paragraph Nos.8(A) and 8(B). Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent.” 7.     The communication by the respondent No.1 Bank dated 20.11.2017        to  the   writ-applicant     herein   is   germane            for adjudication of the present writ-application which reads thus :- Sub : Sale of property at C-303/304, Sree Kuberji TextiIe Park, Property above is under mortgage to our Bank created by M/S. Vinayak Fabrics for the facilities extended to them. However, account has become process of selling the properties mortgaged to us. We have no objection to your buying the above property at Rse 2.50 Crore and you may remit tv proceeds directly to the borrower's account (Vinayak Fabrics ) and on receipt of Rs, 2,50 Crore (Rs. Two Crore and Fifty Lakhs), we wilt release the above property from our charge. Pursuant     to  the   aforesaid       communication      the       writ- applicant deposited the entire amount of Rs.2.50 crores to the respondent No.1 Bank through the respondent No.2 which has been accepted by the respondent No.1 Bank and also encashed by the bank in the account of the respondent No.2. 8.      In view of this Court, it is not open for the respondent No.1 Bank to deny the writ-applicant herein, the title deed, no objection certificate/no due certificate and the sale deed executed in respect of the subject property in terms of the aforesaid letter dated 20.11.2017 issued by the respondent No.1 Bank to sell the property to the writ-applicant on receipt of the consideration of Rs.2.50 crores. It is not open for the Bank to fasten indirect liability of the respondent No.2 – Vinayak Fabrics to the the respondent No.1 Bank in respect of loan advanced to M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines wherein respondent No.2 – Vinayak Fabrics is a guarantor. The respondent Bank is bound by the contractual agreement between the writ-applicant and the respondent Bank. It is not open for the Bank to assert that unless and until the total dues of the Bank which are due and payable by the alleged liability of M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines in favour of the respondent No.1 Bank are realized. The writ-applicant be denied the release of the title deed, no objection certificate/no due certificate with respect to the subject property. 9.      The title deed of the immovable property purchased by the writ-applicant was not mortgaged as collateral/primary security for the purpose of loan granted by the respondent No.1 Bank to M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines wherein respondent No.2 Vinayak Fabrics is a guarantor. Further the language of Section 171 of the Contract Act is explicit to the fact that the bankers are entitled to retain security only for general balance account. Undisputably there is no charge over the immovable property in question. Undisputably there is no charge on the immovable property in question in respect of alleged liability of M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines in favour of the respondent No.1 Bank, therefore in view of above it is not open for the respondent No.1 Bank to deny the contractual commitment of issuing no objection certificate/no due certificate and release of title deeds of the property and the writ-applicant having made full and final payment and the Bank having accepted the same as per the letter dated 20.11.2017, the secured assets has already been sold by the secured creditor i.e. respondent Bank with concurrence of the borrowers to the writ-applicant. 10.       In view of above an equitable mortgage            created by Vinayak Fabrics in respect of alleged loan advanced             to     M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines, the writ-applicant cannot be denied the prayers as prayed for having fulfilled the entire obligation in accordance         with the communication    dated   20.11.2017             as referred above. No subsisted liability can be said to be continued against the writ-applicant herein. 11.       The respondent No.1 bank is directed to release the charge over the property in question and is further directed to hand over the original title documents of the property in question forthwith latest within a period of two weeks from the receipt of this order. 12.        For the foregoing reasons the present writ-application succeeds and the same is allowed. Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent.
The petitioner-husband is before this Court praying to quash      the   order      dated     12.06.2019    passed   in Crl.R.P.No.14/2019 by the learned Sessions Judge, Dharwad confirming the order passed by the learned Magistrate in Crl.Misc.141/2015 dated 15.10.2018. 2. Heard Miss.Joshna P Dhanave, learned counsel for the petitioner. Respondent is served and un-represented. 3. Sans details, facts in brief germane for a resolution of the dispute in the lis are as follows: The petitioner and the respondent are husband and wife.   Marriage between them takes place on 13.04.2001. The marital life between the couple appears to have turned sore, pursuant to which, among other proceedings the respondent-wife    files   a  petition   in  Crl.Misc.No.2/2009 invoking Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (‘Act’ for short).      The learned Magistrate before whom the miscellaneous case was filed under the Act while entertaining the case awards a maintenance of Rs.1,000/-. After invoking the provisions of the    Act,   the   respondent-wife   files   a   petition in Crl.Misc.No.141/2015 invoking Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. for enhancement of the maintenance amount awarded under the Act.   The petition is allowed and the respondent-wife is awarded maintenance of Rs.5,000/- from the date of the 4.    Feeling  aggrieved   by the     order  passed  in Crl.Misc.No.141/2015, the petitioner-husband files Criminal Revision Petition in Crl.R.P.No.14/2019 invoking Section 397 of the Cr.P.C. The learned Sessions Judge dismisses the said Revision Petition by his order dated 12.06.2019 confirming the order passed by the learned Magistrate enhancing maintenance to the wife from Rs.1,000/- to Rs.5,000/-. It is these two orders that are called in question in the subject 5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner- husband Miss. Joshan P Dhanave would vehemently argue and contend that the respondent once having invoked the provisions of the Act could not have filed an application seeking enhancement under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. The order passed by the learned Magistrate as affirmed by the learned Sessions Judge are orders without jurisdiction. The learned counsel would seek quashment of the said orders. 6.   The  respondent-wife  is  served  and    remains 7. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner  and   perused  the  material  on   record.   In furtherance whereof, the only issue that falls for my consideration is, “Whether the maintenance awarded under the Domestic Violence Act can be sought to be enhanced under the Cr.P.C.?” 8. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute.            The respondent-wife invokes Section 12 of the Act seeking reliefs that are available under Section 12.            Section 12 reads as “12. Application to Magistrate.—(1) An aggrieved person or a Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person may present an application to the Magistrate seeking one or more reliefs under this Provided that before passing any order on such application, the Magistrate shall take into consideration any domestic incident report received by him from the Protection Officer or the service provider. (2) The relief sought for under sub-section (1) may include a relief for issuance of an order for payment of compensation or damages without prejudice to the right of such person to institute a suit for compensation or damages for the injuries caused by the acts of domestic violence committed by the respondent: Provided that where a decree for any amount as compensation or damages has been passed by any court in favour of the aggrieved person, the amount, if any, paid or payable in pursuance of the order made by the Magistrate under this Act shall be set off against the amount payable under such decree and the decree shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), or any other law for the time being in force, be executable for the balance amount, if any, left after such set off. (3) Every application under sub-section (1) shall be in such form and contain such particulars as may be prescribed or as nearly as possible thereto. (4) The Magistrate shall fix the first date of hearing, which shall not ordinarily be beyond three days from the date of receipt of the application by the court. (5) The Magistrate shall endeavour to dispose of every application made under sub-section (1) within a period of sixty days from the date of its first hearing.” The relief that is granted by the learned Magistrate is awarding of maintenance of Rs.1,000/- to be paid by the husband-petitioner to the respondent-wife. Maintenance under the said order was all along being paid. 9. Things standing thus, the respondent-wife files a petition in Crl.Misc.141/2015 invoking Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. seeking enhancement of an amount awarded under the Act.     The learned Magistrate allows the petition and enhances the maintenance from Rs.1,000/- to Rs.5,000/-. The learned Magistrate enhances the maintenance amount awarded under the Act in a petition filed for enhancement under the Cr.P.C. The Sessions Judge, in revision, affirms the view taken by the learned Magistrate. 10. In order to resolve the issue, it is germane to notice Sections 125 and 127 of the Cr.P.C. and they read as follows: “125. Order for maintenance of wives, children and parents.—(1) If any person having sufficient means (a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or (b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to maintain itself, or (c) his legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority, where such child is, by reason of any physical or mental abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or (d) his father or mother, unable to maintain himself a Magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, at such monthly rate 66[* * *], as such Magistrate thinks fit, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct: Provided that the Magistrate may order the father of a minor female child referred to in clause (b) to make such allowance, until she attains her majority, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the husband of such minor female child, if married, is not possessed of sufficient means: 67[Provided  further that the Magistrate may, during the pendency of the proceeding regarding monthly allowance for the maintenance under this sub-section, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the interim maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, and the expenses of such proceeding which the Magistrate considers reasonable, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from Provided also that an application for the monthly allowance for the interim maintenance and expenses for proceeding under the second proviso shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of the service of notice of the application to such person.] Explanation.—For the purposes of this Chapter,— (a) “minor” means a person who, under the provisions of the Indian Majority Act, 1875 (9 of 1875), is deemed not to (b) “wife” includes a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and has not remarried. 68[(2) Any such allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance and expenses for proceeding shall be payable from the date of the order, or, if so ordered, from the date of the application for maintenance or interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be.] (3) If any person so ordered fails without sufficient cause to comply with the order, any such Magistrate may, for every breach of the order, issue a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines, and may sentence such person, for the whole or any part of each month's 69[allowance for the maintenance or the interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] remaining unpaid after the execution of the warrant, to imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or Provided that no warrant shall be issued for the recovery of any amount due under this section unless application be made to the Court to levy such amount within a period of one year from the date on which it became due: Provided further that if such person offers to maintain his wife on condition of her living with him, and she refuses to live with him, such Magistrate may consider any grounds of refusal stated by her, and may make an order under this section notwithstanding such offer, if he is satisfied that there is just ground for so doing. Explanation.—If a husband has contracted marriage with another woman or keeps a mistress, it shall be considered to be just ground for his wife's refusal to live with him. (4) No wife shall be entitled to receive an 70[allowance for the maintenance or the interim maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent. (5) On proof that any wife in whose favour an order has been made under this section is living in adultery, or that without sufficient reason she refuses to live with her husband, or that they are living separately by mutual consent, the Magistrate shall cancel the order. 127. Alteration in allowance.—73[(1) On proof of a change in the circumstances of any person, receiving, under Section 125 a monthly allowance for the maintenance or interim maintenance, or ordered under the same section to pay a monthly allowance for the maintenance, or interim maintenance, to his wife, child, father or mother, as the case may be, the Magistrate may make such alteration, as he thinks fit, in the allowance for the maintenance or the interim (2) Where it appears to the Magistrate that, in consequence of any decision of a competent civil court, any order made under Section 125 should be cancelled or varied, he shall cancel the order or, as the case may be, vary the same accordingly. (3) Where any order has been made under Section 125 in favour of a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband, the Magistrate shall, if (a) the woman has, after the date of such divorce, remarried, cancel such order as from the date of her (b) the woman has been divorced by her husband and that she has received, whether before or after the date of the said order, the whole of the sum which, under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties, was payable on such divorce, cancel such order,— (i) in the case where such sum was paid before such order, from the date on which such order was made, (ii) in any other case, from the date of expiry of the period, if any, for which maintenance has been actually (c) the woman has obtained a divorce from her husband and that she had voluntarily surrendered her rights to 74[maintenance or interim maintenance, as the case may be,] after her divorce, cancel the order from the date thereof. (4) At the time of making any decree for the recovery of any maintenance or dowry by any person, to whom a 75[monthly allowance for the maintenance and interim maintenance or any of them has been ordered] to be paid under Section 125, the civil court shall take into account the sum which has been paid to, or recovered by, such person 76[as monthly allowance for the maintenance and interim maintenance or any of them, as the case may be, in pursuance of] the said order.” Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. enables the wife to seek maintenance at the hands of the husband inter alia. Invoking this provision, the learned Magistrate can award maintenance.         Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. deals with alteration in allowance.         A maintenance that is awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. can be varied in an application filed under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C.          What is sine qua non is that an order of maintenance should precede a petition under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C., failing which, a petition  under    Section  127    of the   Cr.P.C.  seeking enhancement of maintenance is not available. 11. It is an undisputed fact that the respondent-wife invoked the provisions of the Act in which maintenance was awarded.     It is also an admitted fact that there is no proceeding initiated by the respondent-wife invoking Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.      Therefore, without there being any determination of maintenance under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., petition under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. is not 12. The language employed in Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. is unequivocal as on a proof of change in the circumstances of any person receiving allowance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. can maintain a petition under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C.    A proceeding under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. therefore should precede a proceeding under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. 13. The fact that provisions of Act was invoked for grant of maintenance and provisions of Cr.P.C. are invoked seeking     enhancement      of    maintenance     cannot   be countenanced in law.       Therefore, the order passed by the learned Magistrate enhancing maintenance under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. was without jurisdiction and a nullity in law. The foundation being a nullity in law, a super structure to it affirming the order of the learned Magistrate, by the learned Sessions Judge will have to follow suit – is to be declared a nullity in law. 14. Therefore, on a coalesce of the aforesaid provisions that falls for consideration in the case at hand and the undisputed facts, would lead to an unmistakable inference that both the orders of the learned Magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge are to be obliterated. 15. For the aforesaid reasons, the following: (i)   The Criminal Petition is allowed. (ii)  The order passed by the learned Magistrate in Crl.Misc.141/2015 dated 15.10.2018 and the order dated 12.06.2019 passed by the learned Sessions  Judge   in Crl.R.P.No.14/2019   stand quashed. (iii) Quashment of the aforesaid orders will not preclude the respondent-wife in initiating any such proceeding in a manner known to law.
1.    Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order dated 06.12.2013 passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in respective first appeals No. 1634 of 2001 and other allied appeals, the original land owners/claimants have preferred the present appeals seeking enhancement of the amount of compensation for the lands acquired. 2.    Large extent of land in different survey number in Adrial Village of Manthani Mandal, Karimnagar District came to be acquired by the State Government for the benefit of Singareni Collieries Company Limited. The lands were acquired for the purposes of excavation of coal. Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act, 1894’) came to be issued on 13.05.1985.          Declaration under Section 6 of the Act 1894 was issued on 31.07.1985. The Land Acquisition Officer passed the awards in the year 1987, fixing the market value for the acquired lands at Rs.7,000/­ per acre for Category 1 – Dry Lands under Cultivation and at Rs.6000/­ per acre for Category 2 – Dry Lands Left Fallow.      Not satisfied with the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer, the land owners sought references under Section 18 of the Act, 1894. The land owners claimed the compensation at Rs.2 lakhs per acre. The Reference Court fixed the market value at Rs.30,000/­ per acre and Rs.50,000/­ per acre. The Reference Court also awarded the compensation @ Rs.15,000/­ per acre towards sub­soil mineral rights. By the impugned common judgment and order the High Court has determined and awarded the compensation @ Rs.80,000/­ per acre considering the market value of the land Rs.1,23,000/­ per acre and thereafter deducting 1/3 rd. The High Court has also in addition awarded Rs.10,000/­ per acre as part of the market value for sub­soil rights. 2.1  Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court determining and awarding the compensation at Rs.80,000/­ per acre and Rs.10,000/­ per acre for sub­soil rights on account of the coal deposits, the original claimants – land owners have preferred the present appeals. 2.2  At the outset, it is required to be noted that against the very impugned common judgment and order the beneficiary – Singareni Collieries Company Limited approached this Court by way of special leave petitions which have been dismissed. The review applications are also dismissed.    Therefore, the short question which is posed for consideration before this Court is whether the amount of compensation determined / awarded by the High Court is required to be enhanced in the appeals preferred by the original claimants/land owners? 3.   Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has    submitted     that    while  determining/awarding    the compensation the Hon’ble High Court has not appreciated that the petitioners were the absolute owners of the land including the sub­soil minerals and were not merely tenure holders. It is submitted that therefore while determining the amount of compensation for the land acquired claim for sub­soil minerals rights was also required to be considered. It is submitted that in the impugned judgment and order the Hon’ble High Court has also specifically given the findings that the nature of deposits existing on the surface or the sub­soil of a land would play an important role and if there are any deposits of rare minerals or precious stones, that would add to the market value of the land. It is submitted that though the Hon’ble High Court has observed that it is not proper for the Land Acquisition Officer or the Civil Court to separately award the compensation towards sub­soil mineral rights, thereafter it is observed that it is permissible to take the fact or into account, while determining the market value. 3.1. It is further submitted by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the land owners/claimants that even otherwise the acquisition was solely for the purpose of excavation of the coal and there was no other purpose for the acquisition and the entire acquired land is being excavated on the basis of the estimates of the coal reserves identified therein, the Hon’ble High   Court   has   erred  in   deducting   1/3rd  towards  the development. It is submitted that since the entire land is to be mined, there is no wastage of land on account of any developmental activities, such as roads, sewage lines, parks etc. which      are    required     to    be      carved    out     in industrial/commercial/housing layouts.      It is submitted that therefore, the deduction from the compensation determined may not be permissible in absence of any justification for such deduction as the entire land is having coal reserves. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of Nelson Fernandes & Ors. versus Special Land Acquisition Officer South Goa & Ors. reported in (2007) 9 SCC 447. 4.    Shri A. Mariarputham, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents while opposing the present appeals has submitted that the amount determined by the Hon’ble High Court which includes Rs.10,000/­ per acre towards the coal deposits, the same is not required to be interfered with by this Hon’ble Court. 4.1   Now so far as 1/3rd deduction made by the Hon’ble High Court from Rs.1,23,000/­ per acre it is submitted that as per the settled position of law there shall be an appropriate deduction   towards     the  development and   therefore  1/3 rd deduction can be said to be just and reasonable deduction towards the development, which is not required to be interfered Making above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeals by further submitting that as such the appeals preferred by the respondents ­ Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. & Ors. have been dismissed by this Court and the judgment and order passed by this Hon’ble High Court has been confirmed by this Court. 5.    Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length. 6.   By the impugned common judgment and order the High Court has determined and awarded Rs.80,000/­ per acre. The High Court has also granted/awarded Rs.10,000/­ for sub­soil rights on account of coal deposits.       Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court, the original claimants/land owners have preferred the present appeals seeking enhancement of the amount of compensation. 6.1  At the outset, it is required to be noted that so far as the appeals preferred by the respondents ­ Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. & Ors., the same have been dismissed by this 6.2  While determining and awarding the compensation at Rs.80,000/­ per acre the High Court has considered the market value of the land in question at Rs.1,23,000/­.         However, thereafter has deducted 1/3rd towards the development charges etc. and thereafter has awarded the actual amount of compensation at Rs.80,000/­ per acre. It is the case on behalf of the claimants/land owners that the lands in question have been acquired for the benefit of the mining company/ Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. which is to be used for excavation of coal. The coal is already existed in the lands acquired. Since the entire land is to be mined and the coal is to be excavated, there is no wastage of land on account of any developmental activities such as roads, sewage lines, parks etc. In that view of the matter, there is no development required and therefore 1/3rd deduction is not warranted at all.       Identical question came to be considered by this Court in the case of Nelson Fernandes (supra) and after taking into consideration the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Basavva vs. Spl. Land Acquisition Officer, (1996) 9 SCC 640, in which this Court has held that the purpose for which acquisition is made is also a relevant factor for determining the market value and the purpose for which the land is acquired must also be taken into consideration, thereafter in paragraph 29 it is observed “29. Both the Special Land Acquisition Officer, the District Judge and of the High Court have failed to notice that the purpose of acquisition is for Railways and that the purpose is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration for fixing the compensation. In this context, we may usefully refer the judgment of this Court in Viluben Jhalejar Contractor v. State of Court held that the purpose for which the land is acquired must also be taken into consideration in fixing the market value and the deduction of development charges. In the above case, the lands were acquired because they were submerged under water of a dam. Owners claimed compensation of Rs 40 per sq ft. LAO awarded compensation ranging from Rs 35 to Rs 60 per sq m. Reference Court fixed the market value of the land at Rs 200 per sq m and after deduction of development charges, determined the compensation @ Rs 134 per sq m. In arriving at the compensation, Reference Court placed reliance on the comparative sale of a piece of land measuring 46.30 sq m @ Rs 270 per sq m. On appeal, the High Court awarded compensation of Rs 180 per sq m in respect of large plots and Rs 200 per sq m in respect of smaller plots. On further appeal, this Court held that since the lands were acquired for being submerged in water of dam and had no potential value and the sale instance relied was a small plot measuring 46.30 sq m whereas the acquisition in the present case was in respect of large area, interest of justice would be subserved by awarding compensation of Rs 160 per sq m in respect of larger plots and Rs 175 per sq m for smaller plots. In Basavva v. Spl. Land Acquisition Officer [(1996) 9 SCC 640 : JT (1996) 5 SC 580] this Court held that the purpose for which acquisition is made is also a relevant factor for determining the market value.” 6.3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision to the facts of the case on hand and when the acquisition is solely for the purpose of excavation of coal and the entire land is acquired on the basis of the estimates of the coal reserve identified and the entire land is to be mined and used and no further developmental activity is required, we are of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has erred in deducting 1/3 rd towards the developmental activities.   The additional amount awarded by the High Court at Rs.10,000/­ per acre on account of coal deposits is not required to be interfered with more particularly when the same has been confirmed by this Court in as much as the appeals preferred by the respondents have been dismissed by this Court. 7.   In view of the above and for the reason stated above, present appeals succeed in part.     It is held that the original claimants shall be entitled to the compensation for the lands acquired at Rs.1,23,000/­ per acre with other statutory benefits which may be available under the provisions of the Act, 1894. In addition, the original claimants shall also be entitled to Rs.10,000/­ per acre as awarded by the High Court on account of coal deposits. The impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court is hereby modified to the aforesaid extent. Present appeals are partly allowed to the aforesaid extent. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
Respondent no.2 - Geeta Javoor, got married to the appellant -          Rangappa      Javoor   on  15.11.2009.     Subsequently,  disputes    arose between the appellant - Rangappa Javoor and respondent no.2 - Geeta On or about 17.02.2011, respondent no.2 - Geeta Javoor lodged a          report,      resultantly    FIR   No.   9/2011   dated  17.02.2011    under Sections 498A, 427, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was registered at            Police    Station   Gadag    Town,   Gadag,   Karnataka,   against   the appellant              -   Rangappa    Javoor.    Subsequently,   chargesheet    dated 01.05.2011 was filed before the trial court, wherein charges under Sections             3   and   4   of   the   Dowry   Prohibition   Act,   1961   were specifically dropped, and no reference is made to the offence under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The parties, i.e. the appellant - Rangappa Javoor and his wife/respondent no.2 - Geeta Javoor, thereafter, had interacted and have entered into a settlement agreement dated 02.04.2012. A decree of divorce by mutual consent was granted by the Court of Principal Senior   Civil  Judge,   Gadag  vide   judgment  dated  10.04.2012.  The parties have also agreed that FIR No. 9/2011 dated 17.02.2011, registered at Police Station Gadag Town, Gadag, Karnataka and the proceedings arising therefrom should be quashed. The appellant - Rangappa Javoor had filed Criminal Petition no. 101840/2014 before the High Court for quashing of the criminal proceedings arising out of FIR No. 9/2011 dated 17.02.2011, albeit by the impugned order, the High Court has rejected the prayer, notwithstanding the fact that the parties have already settled the Respondent    no.2  -  Geeta   Javoor,   though  served,  has  not appeared. She has already got remarried. It is apparent that the parties have resolved and settled their disputes. In the facts of the caes, we do not feel that any useful purpose would be served by continuation of the prosecution. The appellant - Rangappa Javoor, who is an officer in the Border Security Force and as per the job requirement, has to serve in different parts of the country, would be put to harassment. This court has held that in cases of offences relating to matrimonial disputes, if the Court is satisfied that the parties have genuinely settled the disputes amicably, then for the purpose of securing ends  of   justice,   criminal  proceedings   inter-se  parties  can  be quashed   by   exercising   the  powers    under  Article   142  of  the Constitution          of     India1     or    even      under     Section   482      of   Code     of In    view      of    the    aforesaid        position,      we  allow      the   present appeal and set aside the impugned order. Consequently, the criminal proceedings in charge sheet dated 17.02.2011 arising out of FIR No. 9/2011 dated 17.02.2011 under Sections 498A, 427, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, registered at Police Station Gadag Town, Gadag, Karnataka are quashed. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. 1       See Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and Another, (2013) 4 SCC 58 and B.S. Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and Another, (2003) 4 SCC 675. (Arising out of impugned judgment and order dated       17-02-2018 in CRLP No. 101840/2014 passed by the High Court Of Karnataka Circuit Date : 30-01-2023 This matter was called on for hearing today. UPON hearing the counsel, the Court made the following Delay condoned. The appeal is allowed in terms of the signed order. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. (Signed order is placed on the file.)
1.     By way of the present application, permission has been sought by petitioner/accused Amrinder Singh @ Raja to file the petition bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 seeking quashing of FIR No. 258/2010 and the charge-sheet and all the proceedings arising therefrom including the proceedings initiated against the petitioner u/s 82/83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure through his S.P.A. holder Sh. Sukhjinder Singh S/o Mohinder Singh aged about 38 years R/o H. No.- 489, Street No. 8 Ghuman Nagar, Sarhandh Road, Patiala Punjab who is the brother of the petitioner/accused. The present application under disposal has been signed by the said SPA of the petitioner/accused. The affidavit in support of this application has also been executed by the said SPA holder. 2.     The title of the petition bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 reads The State of NCT of Delhi. 3.     I have heard the Ld. counsel for the petitioner, Ld. APP for the State and perused the records of this case. 4.     It is contended by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner/accused that the petitioner/accused has not been named in the FIR and there is no admissible      evidence    against  the   petitioner/accused      and the petitioner/accused has only been made an accused on the basis of the disclosure statement of the co-accused. It is further submitted by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner/accused that there is nothing on record to show that the petitioner was a travel agent doing the business of travel agency or was doing any business ancillary to travel agency. He further submitted that the petitioner is a business man and working as a Director of an NRI company, the fact which was thoroughly investigated by the IO in May 2010. It is further submitted by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner/accused that the order dated 05.03.2016 declaring the petitioner/accused as absconder is bad in law and has been passed without following the due procedure. 5.     On the other hand, it is submitted by the Ld. APP for the State that there are allegations against the petitioner/accused and it cannot be said that the case is of no evidence. It is further submitted by the Ld. APP that this is not the first time that the petitioner has been declared absconder and he further submitted that the petitioner was previously declared PO vide order dated 20.12.2011 and the said proceedings were dropped vide order dated 11.11.13 when an application in this regard was moved by the petitioner/accused for dropping of the proceedings U/s 82 Cr.P.C. It is further submitted by the Ld. APP that despite this, the petitioner did not mend his ways and again failed to appear before the trial Court and he was again declared absconder vide order dated 6.     It is vehemently argued by the Ld. APP that the present petition under article 227 of the Constitution of India read with section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not maintainable as the same has been filed through S.P.A. holder and the present application and petition are liable to be dismissed. (Criminal) 586; it has been observed as under:- “9. The plain reading of the ratio of law, laid down, in the aforesaid cases, clearly goes to reveal, that it is only the accused person, against whom, a criminal case, has been registered or a criminal complaint, has been filed, can file a petition, under Section 482 Cr.P.C., in the High Court, for quashing the complaint, the summoning order, and the subsequent proceedings, and no third person, can fight a proxy war, on his behalf, under the garb of public interest litigant. The aggrieved party, which is affected by an order, is required to seek redress of its grievance, by questioning the legal validity or correctness of the same. It is another thing, if the aggrieved party, is suffering from some disability i.e. unless such party is a minor, an insane person, or is suffering from any other disability, which, in law, is recognized as sufficient to permit any other person e.g. next friend, to move the Court, on his behalf. On behalf of minor, or insane person, a guardian or a next friend, initiates proceedings, so as to challenge the legality and validity of the order, passed against him, to seek redressal of the grievance, as under law, such a person having disability, cannot be said to be competent, to file a petition, except through next friend or guardian. In the instant case, there is nothing, on the record, that Amit Ahuja, petitioner, is suffering from any disability, recognized by the provisions of law. He is an accused, in the aforesaid complaint. It is he, who is aggrieved, against the complaint and the summoning order. It is he, who can challenge the same, on any ground which may be available to him, under the provisions of law. If, in criminal cases, until and unless, a person aggrieved, suffers from some disability, recognized by law, a stranger or some other person, is allowed, to fight the proxy war, then the very purpose of criminal justice system, shall be defeated. In that event, the Courts, would be mushroomed, by public interest litigants. In this view of the matter, the present petition, under Section 482 Cr.P.C., filed by the petitioner, through his attorney, is not maintainable. On this ground alone, the same is liable to be dismissed.” 8.   In T.C. Mathai and another Vs. The District & Sessions Judge, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, AIR 1999 SC 1385; in para 15, it is “15. Section 2 of the Power of Attorney Act cannot override the specific provision of a statute which requires that a particular act should be done by a party in person. When the Code requires the appearance of an accused in a court it is no compliance with it if a power of attorney holder appears for him. It is a different thing that a party can be permitted to appear through counsel. Chapter XVI of the Code empowers the Magistrate to issue summons or warrant for the appearance of the accused. Section 205 of the Code empowers the Magistrate to dispense with “the personal attendance of accused, and permit him to appear by his pleader” if he sees reasons to do so. Section 273 of the Code speaks of the powers of the court to record evidence in the presence of the pleader of the accused, in cases when personal attendance of the accused is dispensed with. But in no case can the appearance of the accused be made through a power of attorney holder. So the contention of the appellant based on the instrument of power of attorney is of no avail in this case.” 9.     In the instant case as well the petition has been filed through SPA holder which is per se not maintainable. Therefore no permission can be granted to the petitioner to file the present petition bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 under article 227 of the Constitution of India read with section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking quashing of FIR No. 258/2010 and the charge-sheet and all the proceedings arising therefrom including the proceedings initiated against the petitioner u/s 82/83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure through his SPA holder. Therefore, I find no ground to accept the prayer     made    in    the   present  application    bearing      No. Crl. M.A.10986/2021, the same is, therefore, dismissed, consequently, the petition bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 is also dismissed. All pending applications (if any) are disposed of.
This appeal is filed by the appellant-complainant under Section 378 of Cr.P.C. for setting aside the judgment of acquittal passed by the Second Additional District   and   Sessions     Judge,   Davanagere    in Crl.A.No.140/2010 dated 07.04.2011 and to confirm the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Principal Senior Civil Judge and CJM, Davanagere in C.C.No.1303/2009 dated 18.10.2010. 2.    Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for the respondent. 3.    The case of the appellant before the trial Court is that he has filed a private compliant under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. against the respondent-accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 read with Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'N.I. Act') alleging that the accused and complainant are known to each other. The father of the respondent-accused - Bharamappa said to be borrowed    Rs.2,60,000/-   from    the  complainant- appellant on 07.03.2003 for his business and his family necessities and agreed to pay 2% interest per month by executing the on-demand promissory note in favour of the complainant.   In the meantime, the father of the accused - Bharamappa died leaving behind his son-accused as a legal heir i.e., prior to filing of the private complaint. On the death of Bharamappa, the complainant asked the accused for repayment of the loan amount and the accused requested for sometime. But he has paid Rs.10,000/- to    the  complainant   on    10.06.2005    and  the complainant asked the accused to clear the dues of his father. Later, the interest as well as principal amount was calculated for Rs.4,50,000/- and the accused said to be issued two cheques bearing Nos.571677 and 571679 drawn on Vijaya Bank, Davanagere Branch for the sum of Rs.2,25,000/- each dated 07.06.2006 and 07.07.2006 respectively.      The cheques were presented for encashment which came to be dishonored as the account was closed. A notice also served on the accused, but, he did not pay the amount. Hence, the complaint came to be filed before the Magistrate. After appearance of the respondent- accused, plea was recorded, he claimed to be tried and on behalf of the complainant, he has examined himself as PW.1 and got marked 14 documents. Statement of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. was recorded and his case is one of the total denial and he has not led any evidence.     After hearing the arguments, the trial Court found the accused guilty and convicted and sentenced to pay Rs.4,95,000/- and in default, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for one year. Out of which, Rs.4,50,000/- payable to the complainant as compensation under Section 357 4.   The   judgment    of  conviction has  been challenged by the accused before the Sessions Judge. The Sessions Judge being the Appellate Court allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court and acquitted the accused. Hence, the complainant is before this Court by way of 5.   The learned counsel for the complainant has contended that the judgment of the First Appellate Court is erroneous and also not correct. The accused himself   has  undertaken     to  discharge  the  loan borrowed by his father, but, he has paid Rs.10,000/- by cash.    Subsequently, he has issued two cheques, but the First Appellate Court failed to consider the same and set aside the judgment of conviction and sentence on the ground that there is no legally enforceable debt which is not correct.     Therefore, prayed for setting aside the judgment of acquittal and confirm the conviction and sentence passed by the 6.    Per contra, the respondent counsel has contended that there is no legally enforceable debt payable by the accused in order to file complaint against him. The debt is time barred. Therefore, the learned counsel supported the judgment passed by the First Appellate Court and hence, prayed for dismissing the appeal. 7.     Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records, the point that arises for my consideration are: 1)     Whether the complainant is able to prove that there is legally enforceable debt   payable   by   the    respondent- 2)     Whether the judgment of the First Appellate Court is liable to be set aside ? 8.     It is not in dispute that the father of the accused borrowed loan from the complainant and the father of the accused died prior to filing of the private complaint.    It  is  alleged    that   the   complainant approached the accused to repay the loan, where the accused undertaken to repay the loan and he said to be issued two cheques.      The main contention of the counsel for the accused is that there is no legally enforceable    debt   payable    by    him   and   second contention is time bound debt which cannot be enforceable. In this regard, the learned counsel for the appellant brought to the notice of this Court that as  per   Section   29   of   the  N.I. Act,   the   legal representative of the deceased person is liable to discharge the liability of the father. The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of ICDS LTD. vs. BEENA SHABEER AND ANOTHER reported in (2002) 6 SCC 9.    On perusal of Section 29 of the N.I. Act, which defines as follows: “29. Liability of legal representative signing A legal representative of a deceased person who signs his name to a promissory note, bill  of  exchange     or   cheque   is  liable personally   thereon unless he       expressly limits his liability to the extent of the assets received by him as such". 10.   As per Section 29 of the N.I. Act, the legal representative of the deceased issued a cheque and he is liable personally. That apart, as per the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of ICDS LTD. stated supra, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has upheld the judgment of the trial Court wherein in the said case, a guarantor issued cheque towards payment of the dues outstanding against the principal debtor (hire-purchaser of car in the said case) and the complaint was filed against the guarantor as the cheque   issued     by    the   guarantor   came    to be dishonored. Considering the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, where, in this case, the accused is none other than the son of the deceased-father who borrowed the loan from the complainant and the accused agreed to repay the same and he has issued the cheque.       Such being the case, as a legal representative of the father, the accused is liable to repay the loan to the complainant.       Therefore, the contention raised by the respondent counsel is not acceptable and on the other hand, the complainant is not able to prove the liability of the accused and the cheque was dishonored, thereby, the accused is liable for the punishment under Section 138 of N.I. Act and the complaint is maintainable. 11.  In respect of the another contention raised by the respondent that the debt is time barred one, his father borrowed loan in the year 2003, the cheque was issued after four years, therefore, there is no liability. In this regard, the complainant has stated and it is specifically mentioned that the accused has undertaken to repay the amount and he has paid Rs.10,000/-     within  two    years   and  specifically mentioned that on 10.06.2005, the accused repaid Rs.10,000/-     towards    his   father’s  liability and thereafter in the year 2006, he has issued two cheques on this behalf.     Therefore, once the amount was already repaid, the question of taking contention that it is barred debt does not arise and it gets renewed.       Therefore,    the   accused    once   paid Rs.10,000/- by cash and subsequently, he issued a cheque to discharge the liability, he is liable for discharging his liability of his father.  Therefore, the trial Court has rightly convicted the accused as the First Appellate Court not considered Section 29 of the N.I. Act and has erred in acquitting the accused. Therefore, the judgment of the First Appellate Court is liable to be set aside. 12.   Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The judgment of the II Additional Sessions Judge, Davanagere in Crl.A.No.140/2010 is hereby set The   judgment    of   the   trial  Court   in C.C.No.1303/2009 convicting the respondent-accused is hereby upheld.
