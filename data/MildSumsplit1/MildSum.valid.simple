The Supreme Court observed that an application seeking to assign a review petition to a particular HC judge should be placed before Chief Justice of the High Court and not to be dealt on judicial side.  Justice GS Patel reserved a second appeal for judgment while he was sitting at the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court. The judgment allowing the second appeal was delivered through virtual mode by the Judge while sitting at Bombay. The respondent thereafter filed a review petition which was listed before Justice Nutan D. Sardessai who admitted it. An application was filed by the other party praying that the review petition be transferred and be placed before Justice G.S. Patel for final disposal. This application was dealt by Justice Prithviraj K. Chavan who rejected it. Against the said order, the party approached the Apex Court. We do not wish to go into the issue of interpreting the Rules in order to hold as to whether the review should be heard by Judge 'A' or any other Judge, the bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Vikram Nath observed. The court however added that the matter ought to have been placed before the Chief Justice on the administrative side rather than order being passed on the judicial side. "The proviso to Rule 3(1) of Chapter XXX of the Rules confers this power on the Chief Justice to assign a particular matter to a single Judge for hearing of the review application where the single Judge concerned was not available for the time being by reason of being on leave or otherwise as aforesaid i.e. where he had ceased to sit at a particular Bench. The Chief Justice, being the master of roster and being conferred with specific powers of assigning review petitions in given circumstances under the Rules, the learned single Judge ought not to have dealt with the application dated 16.07.2009 (Misc. Civil Application No.526 of 2019), but should have referred the matter to be placed before the Chief Justice.", the court said while setting aside the impugned order. Case details Suresh G.

The Supreme Court observed that an application seeking exemption from surrendering is not required to be filed along with a special leave petitions against cancellation of bail orders. Justice Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, while considering one such case, noted that large number of such applications for exemptions are routinely filed when there is no need to adopt such a procedure at all. "The officers of the Registry must know the Supreme Court Rules like the back of ones hand. Order XXII Rule 5, applies only to cases where the petitioner is 'sentenced to a term of imprisonment' and it cannot be confused with simple orders of cancellation of bail.", the judge said.  Registrar (Judicial) has been directed to issue formal instructions to the concerned filing, scrutiny and numbering Sections with respect to matters in which Order XX, Rule 3 and Order XXII, Rule 5 will apply. In this case, the petitioner was arrested for an offence under Section 420 read with 34 IPC. He was granted bail by the High Court subject to payment of an amount. Upon his failure to pay the amount the High Court recalled its order granting bail and ordered the petitioner to surrender. An application to recall that order came to be dismissed by the impugned order. A Special Leave Petition was filed against the said order. Along with it an application for exemption from surrendering was also filed.  The Chamber Judge granted exemption and a notice was issued on the application. On 10.08.2021 the Chamber Judge directed that the petitioner must pay balance money within four weeks, if not, the application for surrendering will be dismissed without reference to the Court. As the amount was not deposited it was assumed that the application stands dismissed without reference to the Court. Thus, the petitioner filed the application for restoration. This time, the application was considered by Justice Narasimha. The judge enquired from the lawyer for the petitioner the need for seeking an exemption from surrendering when the order impugned is only a case of cancellation of bail. "He says that the Registry normally insists on filing such an application and he has no option. When I informed the counsel that the Rule applies only for Criminal Appeals or Special Leave Petitions where the petitioner is 'sentenced to a term of imprisonment' and not to SLP's against cancellation of bail, some lawyers spoke from the Bar and said that they find it prudent to file such applications instead of arguing with the Registry without any success. This is completely unacceptable.", the judge noted. Another lawyer, Adv Raghenth Basant, brought to the notice of the judge that successive orders have been passed by the Supreme Court holding that applications for surrender were wrongly filed and that there was no need to insist on filing of such applications. [Kapur Singh Vs. State of Haryana 2021 SCC Online 586, Dilip Majumder v. Nikunja Das &Anr. SLP (Crl) Dy. No.6517/2020, Vivek Rai v. High Court of Jharkhand (2015) 12 SCC 86, K.M. Nanavati v.

The Constitutional remedy under Article 136 is available to the petitioner without surrendering as this is not a case where the accused is 'sentenced'. As this is not a case requiring surrender, there was never a need to file the application for exemption from surrendering.", the judge said. The bench therefore recalled the earlier order and directed the case to be listed before the Regular Bench for admission and disposal.   Case name: Mahavir Arya Vs State Govt.

The Supreme Court has held that employees who retired under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) cannot claim parity with others who retired upon achieving the age of superannuation for the purposes of pay revision.  Factual Matrix leading to the Civil Appeal What was up for challenge before the bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and S. Ravindra Bhat in this civil appeal was a decision of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur bench) wherein the Maharashtra State Financial Corporation Ex-Employees Association had challenged the decision dated 29.03.2010 taken by the State of Maharashtra on ground of it being discriminatory and arbitrary.  The decision denied the benefit of revision of pay scales, as recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission, to the employees of the Maharashtra State Financial Corporation (MSFC) who had retired or died during the period of 01.01.2006 to 29.03.2010. That decision of the State made the revision of pay scale as a result of the Report of the Fifth Pay Commission applicable to 115 employees of MSFC who were working as on 29.03.2010. The revision, however, was given effect from 01.01.2006.  Impugned Order  By the impugned order, the High Court rejected the contentions raised by the Appellant association and accepted the submissions of MSFC and the State, that financial considerations were of importance in regard to grant or denial of monetary benefits. Appellant's contentions Mr. Jay Salva advancing his arguments on behalf of the Appellant Association broadly made the following four-point submissions:  1. That the Appellants were in continuous service, and had even received the benefit of interim revision, pending finalisation of pay scales pursuant to the Pay Commission Report. 2. That those in employment on and after 29.03.2010, and those who continued in service after 01.01.2006 but retired before 29.03.2010, belonged to the same category. The only difference between those who were in service after the latter date, was that they had longer period of service. 3. That the crucial date for grant of pay revision, was the date from which it was given effect to, i.e., 01.01.2006. As all the appellants were in service as on that date, the denial of pay revision, which was concededly for the period they had worked, amounted to not only hostile discrimination, but also withholding of pay revision benefits, legitimately and rightfully theirs.  4. That the total liability of the MSFC is not more than ₹32 crores, in respect of past employees, including those who had retired, sought VRS, or had died before the pay revision was made effective. Contentions of MSFC and the State  Advocate Sachin Patil appearing for the Respondents broadly made the following four-point submissions:  1. That MSFC is an autonomous corporation established under the State Financial Corporation Act. It is not bound to follow the terms and conditions applicable to Maharashtra Government employees. In fact, it has to independently generate its income from its own resources to meet any additional burden or expenditure due to increased pay or increase in wages for its employees.  2. That under Section 39 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 MSFC has to seek guidance and directives of the State Government in policy matters but it is not bound by the decision of the State to implement the decisions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Pay Commissions for its employees.  3. That the employees of the Corporation cannot claim, as a matter of right, any benefit of pay revision without MSFC’s ability to bear the burden of such pay increase. 4. That the fixation of cut-off date is a policy matter, especially in respect of revision of salaries, allowances, and the other benefits to employees of a State Corporation. These depend on various considerations, including financial constraints and the number of employees involved.  Analysis and Judgment While holding that revision of pay involves a larger public interest, the bench observed, "That on whether, and what should be the extent of pay revision, are undoubtedly matters falling within the domain of executive policy making". While specifying that the court could not examine the fixation of cut-off date for the grant of benefits, the bench observed, "what is within the domain of the court, is to examine the impact of such fixation and whether it results in discrimination."  The bench further observed, "In the present case, too, there is no denial that the employees who retired prior to 29.03.2010 discharged the same duties as in the case of those who did thereafter. The quality and content of responsibilities assigned to them were the same. The respondents’ decision not to grant arrears prior to 01.01.2006 cannot be found fault with; however, not to grant any revision to those who were not in service when the order implementing the pay revision was issued and confining it to those, in employment is clearly discriminatory."  "...there is no distinction between those who retired (or died in service) before 29.03.2010 and those who continued in service - and were given the pay revision. Those who worked during the period 01.01.2006 to 29.03.2010 and those who continued thereafter, fell in the same class, and a further distinction could not be made," the bench added.  The court further held the exclusion of the retired employees, who retired between 01.01.2006 and 29.03.2010 on achieving their date of superannuation, as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. However, the court then laid down an exception. It observed, "However...employees who secured VRS benefits and left the service of MSFC voluntarily during this period, stand on a different footing. They cannot claim parity with those who worked continuously, discharged their functions, and thereafter superannuated. VRS employees chose to opt and leave the service of the corporation; they found the VRS offer beneficial to them...For the above reasons, it is held that VRS employees cannot claim parity with others who retired upon achieving the age of superannuation. Likewise, those who ceased to be in employment, for the reason of termination, or their dismissal, etc., would not be entitled to the benefit of pay revision." Holding thus, the bench allowed the appeal to the extent that those who retired from the services of MSFC between 01.01.2006 to 29.03.2010, and the legal heirs/representatives of those who died during that period, are entitled to arrears based on pay revision, accepted by the Corporation.

It is not as if this Court approved of adultery, the Supreme Court observed in its order clarifying that its 2018 judgment striking down Section 497 IPC [Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2019) 3 SCC 39 ] will not impact court martial proceedings initiated against personnel serving the armed forces for adulterous conduct. A five judge bench comprising Justices KM Joseph, Ajay Rastogi, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar was disposing a miscellaneous application filed by the Union Government.  The centre had contended that the application was filed in view of the Armed Forces Tribunal quashing certain disciplinary proceedings initiated against personnel for inappropriate sexual conduct by citing the Joseph Shine judgment. The ASG pointed out that the Joseph Shine judgment was premised on the patriarchal connotations of Section 497 IPC; however, the actions taken in Army are gender neutral and female officers are also liable to disciplinary action. Section 45 of the Army Act, which penalises 'unbecoming conduct' reads as follows: Any officer, junior commissioned officer or warrant officer who behaves in a manner unbecoming his position and the character expected of him shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he is an officer, be liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and, if he is a junior commissioned officer or a warrant officer, be liable to be dismissed or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned. The centre had sought clarification that in a case where the officer is charged with what is unbecoming conduct and it consists of an act of adultery, nothing can stand in the way of the authorities taking action. "In fact, we may notice that it is not as if this Court approved of adultery. This Court has found that adultery may be a moral wrong (per Hon’ble Ms. Justice Indu Malhotra). This Court has also held that it will continue to be a ground for securing dissolution of marriage. It has also been described as a civil wrong. This Court has found that adultery may be a moral wrong (per Hon’ble Ms. Justice Indu Malhotra). This Court has also held that it will continue to be a ground for securing dissolution of marriage.

The Bombay High court recently quashed an FIR under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) for penetrative sexual assault, as the victim girl (now a major) says that she and the accused were allegedly in love and are now to be married.  Justices Prasanna B. Varale and SM Modak stated, "we are inclined to accept the request for quashing the FIR, only by considering their future. If the prosecution still remains, it will come in their peaceful life."  The father of the victim girl had filed a complaint for sexual abuse and sexual harassment of his minor daughter by the applicant. The applicant was consequently accused in a FIR under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 4 of the POCSO Act. He was arrested and the police had also filed charge sheet which is pending before the Special Court at Thane.  The victim girl, now a major, filed an affidavit stating that they were in love with each other. Now they have decided to marry after settling in life in their respective careers. Her parents also filed affidavits, giving explanation of misunderstanding while lodging the FIR. They stated to have accepted the friendship between their daughter and the applicant.  The victim girl tried to give an explanation about her statement recorded by the Police and Magistrate. She alleged that she was tutored to give those statements. Without accepting the said explanation, the Judges were inclined to accept the prayer for quashing since both have agreed to marry.  The justices noted that the victim-girl has given a no objection for quashing. They further took note that the applicant is willing to marry with the victim-girl and has given an undertaking to that effect. In view of their prospects, the court quashed the FIR.

The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to complete the investigation of the Adani-Hindenburg issue within a period of two months and file a status report before the Court. The bench noted the stand of the SEBI is that it is already investigating into the allegations of the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report to identify violations.  The bench ordered that as a part of the ongoing investigation, SEBI shall also investigate :  (a) Whether there is a violation of Rule 19A of the Securities Contract Regulation Rules;  (b) Whether there is a failure to disclose transactions with related parties and other relevant information which concerns related parties to the SEBI in accordance with law;  (c) Whether there was any manipulation of stock prices in contravention of existing laws.  "The above directions shall not be construed to limit the contours of the ongoing investigation. SEBI shall expeditiously conclude its investigation within two months and file a status report", the bench ordered. Court constitutes expert committee : The Court also constituted an expert committee to review the regulatory mechanism in the light of Adani-Hindenburg issue. A bench comprising CJI DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha, and Justice JB Pardiwala appointed the following persons as the members of the committee : Mr OP Bhat(former Chairman of SBI), retired Justice JP Devadhar , Mr KV Kamath, Mr Nandan Nilakeni, Mr.Somasekharan Sundaresan as the members of the committee. The Committee will be under the head of former Supreme Court judge Justice AM Sapre.  The committee shall submit its report in a sealed cover before this court within 2 months. The SEBI shall also inform the expert committee the action it has taken in furtherance of the directions as well as the steps taken as part of the ongoing investigation. The bench noted that the cases concern the loss of investor wealth over the past few weeks due to the steep decline of Adani group companies, precipitated by the Hindenburg Research report which alleged manipulations and malpractices by the Adani group companies. The bench also noted that the Hindenburg had stated that it had taken a short position in the Adani group shares.  It was on 17th February 2023 that the Court had decided to constitute an expert committee to analyse if the regulatory mechanism needed to be strengthened to protect Indian investors from the kind of market volatility which was witnessed following the release of the Hindenburg Research report against Adani Group. Notably, the bench had refused to accept the names proposed by the Central Government in a sealed cover for inclusion in the proposed committee. "We will select the experts and maintain full transparency. If we take names from the government, it would amount to a government constituted committee. There has to be full (public) confidence in the committee", CJI Chandrachud had orally observed while reserving orders. The CJI had also clarified that the Court will not start with a presumption of failure of regulatory framework in the issue. Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta had informed the bench that the Central Government was agreeable to the Court's suggestion to constitute an expert committee. But the law officer urged the Court to ensure  that the move does not unintentionally create an impression that the regulatory mechanism has inadequacies.The bench reserved the orders on the PILs filed by Advocate Vishal Tiwari, Advocate ML Sharma, Congress leader Jaya Thakur and Anamika Jaiswal. While the petitions filed by Tiwari and Sharma sought investigation against the Hindenburg report for causing losses to Indian investors, the petitions of Thakur and Jaiswal sought investigation against Adani group on the basis of the allegations levelled by Hindenburg.  On January 24, US-based Hindenburg published its report accusing Adani group of widespread manipulations and malpractices to inflate its stock prices. Adani Group refuted the allegations by publishing a 413-page reply and even went to the extent of terming it as attack against India. Hindenburg shot back with a rejoinder, saying that 'fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism' and stood by its report. After the publishing of the Hindenburg report, Adani shares crashed and the embattled group was also forced to recall its FPO.

The National Company Law Tribunal ("NCLT"), New Delhi Bench, comprising of Shri. Abni Ranjan Kumar Sinha (Judicial Member) and Shri. L. N. Gupta (Technical Member), in M/s. Dalmia Family Office Trust v M/s. Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd., has dismissed the application filed under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 ("IBC"), seeking initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process ("CIRP") against Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd. after the outstanding dues were paid off. A cost of Rs. 1 Lakh has been imposed on Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd. for delaying the proceedings and depositing the due amount in the account of Dalmia Family Office Trust without its consent and after the NCLT Bench had reserved the order. The Order was passed on 06.06.2022.  Background Facts  M/s. Dalmia Family Office Trust ("Applicant") had filed an Application under the Section 7 of the IBC before NCLT New Delhi ("Adjudicating Authority"), seeking initiation of CIRP against Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd. ("Respondent") for an outstanding of Rs. 4,88,20,618/- as on 30.09.2021 as mentioned in Part IV of the application, out of which Rs 1,40,00,000/- was the Principal Amount. The date of default was mentioned as 28.10.2015 in the application.  When the Adjudicating Authority had reserved the matter for order, the Corporate Debtor deposited Rs. 4,90,00,000/- in the account of the Applicant on 16.05.2022, without the latter's consent.   Contentions Of The Parties  The Applicant submitted that the Respondent had deposited Rs. 4,90,00,000/- without any prior consent as there were no settlement between the parties. Further, a balance amount of Rs. 65,83,033/- was still outstanding towards the principal dues, after Rs. 4,90,00,000/- was adjusted towards the interest portion calculated till 24.05.2022. Hence, CIRP could be initiated.   The Respondent submitted that the payment of Rs. 4,90,00,000/- had resulted in complete discharge of the full Principal amount of Rs.1,40,00,000/- as well as the interest as claimed by the applicant in the Part IV of the Application.  Observations Of The Adjudicating Authority  The Adjudicating Authority observed that the Applicant has also claimed interest portion falling within the suspension period of IBC under Section 10A, i.e from 25.03.2020 to 24.03.2021, for which no CIRP can ever be initiated. The said fact was not relevant prior to deposit of Rs. 4,90,00,000/- by the Respondent, since the principal outstanding claimed Application was above Rs 1 Crore, which was due and payable much prior to the suspension period of IBC.  The Bench observed that the Applicant had received Rs.4,90,00,000/-, which was more than the total amount claimed of Rs.4,88,20,618/-. It was held that the Applicant cannot claim any amount beyond what is claimed in the Part IV of its Application since it is a trite law that the IBC proceedings are not recovery proceedings.  The Bench dismissed the application and imposed a cost amounting to Rs. 1 Lakh on the Respondent for delaying the matter and depositing Rs.4,90,00,000/- behind the back of the Applicant without its consent, when the order was reserved by the Bench.

Possession of license to do business in  a particular shop does not entitle a party to the allotment of auction platform as a matter of right , particularly, in front of and/or adjacent to their shop, the Supreme Court recently held. “Even as rightly observed by the High Court, to do business in the shop and to carry on business on the auction platform, are both different and distinct. Merely because a person is having a licence and doing business in a particular shop, he is not entitled to the auction platform as a matter of right and that too, in front of and/or adjacent to his shop. No such rule and/or regulation and/or guideline supporting such a claim has been brought to the notice of the High Court or even this Court”, a Bench of Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna highlighted.   The appellant became the owner of Shop No. 27 situated in the Agricultural Produce Market, Chandigarh. Respondent No. 5 was the tenant of the shop. Both the parties were holding the requisite licences to do business in the market area. It so happened that ejectment proceedings against respondent No. 5 were confirmed by the High Court. The latter then shifted to Shop No. 12 in the year 2007 and applied for change of address to the new shop. It, however was rejected and he was asked to surrender his licence and apply for new one.   In the meanwhile, a fresh license was issued to the appellant, who started running the business from Shop No. 27 owned by him. Respondent No. 5 filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the order which rejected his application for change of address. The order was stayed which continued till the validity of licence of respondent No. 5 came to an end. Respondent No. 5’s application for license renewal was rejected again.   After the High Court’s interference, respondent No. 5 continued to function as per the old licence. The Licence Committee constituted under Licensing of Auction Platform Rules, 1981 decided that the site in the platform would be allotted on the basis of “One Site One Shop” and the name of respondent No. 5 was shown as co¬allottee along with the appellant.  After a plea was moved, the High Court directed that the licence of respondent No. 5 be renewed. The High Court also held that respondent No. 5 is entitled to use the platform in front of Shop No. 27 till any alternative policy comes by way of amendment in the Act or the Rules, pertaining to the issue of rights to use the auction platform.   The Court also held that right to use the platform and to have the licence to do the business in the market area both are distinct and different and the two rights were not directly linked.  The Division bench of the High Court confirmed the order when an appeal was moved.  When the matter reached the Supreme Court, it opined that though the appellant is claiming shed/auction platform just adjacent to shop No. 27, he was unable to establish and/or show any specific rules and/or regulations in that regard.  “Therefore, in the absence of any specific right in his favour, the appellant could not have prayed for the allotment of shed/auction platform just adjacent to and/or in front of his shop No. 27.” After the shed collapsed in 2007, the allotments have been made in accordance with the Secretary, Agriculture’s guidelines, the Court noted. “Under the circumstances, the appellant is not entitled to any preferential treatment and/or allotment dehors observance of principles and guidelines issued by the Secretary regarding allotment of the auction platforms. The appellant is to be treated at par and equally with other persons doing business in the market and on the auction platform.” On the allotment of the auction platform in favour of respondent No. 5, the Court noted that he has been holding the licence and doing business since 1970, whereas the appellant got the licence in 2007. It also observed that issues pertaining to after the collapse were considered by the Market Committee while deciding the representation. On these grounds, the Bench rejected the appeals.  Case Title: Gurjit Singh (D) Vs Union Territory, Chandigarh & Ors. | Civil Appeal Nos. 4826¬4828 Of 2022  
The Bombay High Court recently held that remarriage will not disentitle the widow of a deceased in a motor accident from receiving compensation. Justice SG Dige observed that remarriage cannot be a taboo against motor accident compensation – “One cannot expect that for getting compensation of deceased husband, the widow has to remain widow for life time or till getting compensation. Considering her age, and at the time of accident, she was wife of deceased, is sufficient ground that she is entitled for the compensation. Moreover after death of husband remarriage can not be a taboo to get a compensation.”  The court dismissed an insurance company’s plea against award of compensation to widow of deceased in a motor accident who later remarried. The deceased was a pillion rider on the motorcycle of one Sakharam Gaikwad. They were riding towards on the Mumbai-Pune Highway when an auto rickshaw crashed into the bike injuring both riders.  The deceased died while receiving treatment. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal awarded compensation to his wife and two family members. Therefore, the insurance company approached the High Court against the tribunal’s judgement.  The insurance company contended that the widow of the deceased is not entitled to compensation as she remarried after his death. It also contended that the permit to ply the offending rickshaw was only for Thane District but the incident happened outside Thane. Therefore, the driver violated the terms and conditions of the permit. The court said that there is a difference between breach of terms of insurance policy and breach of terms of permit issued by RTO authority. The court added that though the permit to ply was for Thane District, it does not preclude the driver to take the rickshaw outside Thane District. The court noted that the insurance company did not examine any witness to prove that taking the rickshaw outside Thane District was breach of permit and that it amounts to breach of terms policy  The court further noted that at the time of accident, the wife of the deceased was only 19 years old. She remarried during the pendency of the claim petition. The court said that a widow cannot be expected to remain a widow for life or till getting compensation. The court noted that all or any legal representative of the deceased can seek compensation as per section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Thus, it was legal for the wife of the deceased to file an application for compensation as she was his legal representative at the time of the accident, the court said.  The court held that all three claimants are entitled to Rs. 40,000/- each as consortium amount, Rs 15,000/- compensation for funeral expenses and Rs 15,000 for loss of estate. The tribunal had awarded Rs. 70,000/- for funeral expenses, loss of love and affection, and consortium. Therefore, the court awarded an additional Rs 80,000/- to the claimants.

The Gujarat High Court has reiterated that there is a clear mandate on the employer under the provisions of Section 7 to the Payment of Gratuity Act, for payment of gratuity within time and to pay interest on the delayed payment of gratuity. In light of the above, the Bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav directed the Sardar Patel University to pay Rs. 10 lakhs towards gratuity... The Gujarat High Court has reiterated that there is a clear mandate on the employer under the provisions of Section 7 to the Payment of Gratuity Act, for payment of gratuity within time and to pay interest on the delayed payment of gratuity.  In light of the above, the Bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav directed the Sardar Patel University to pay Rs. 10 lakhs towards gratuity of the Petitioner, a retired reader, along with interest at 9% for wrongfully withholding the graturty since his retirement in 2013. The direction was passed in petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution where the Petitioner had prayed for the declaration that the action of the Respondents in not paying Rs. 10 lakhs along with 18% interest towards his gratuity, was arbitrary.  The Petitioner joined services as a lecturer at the Sardar Patel University from 04.10.1979 onwards. He was confirmed in service from 28.09.1986. It was the Petitioner's case that since his appointment was made after 01.04.1982 on the post of reader, his services had been counted towards the pension scheme. He retired from service on 14.06.2013.  The Petitioner claimed that he was entitled to Rs. 10 lakhs gratuity in view of a notification of 2010 pursuant to which the gratuity amount was enhanced from Rs. 3,50,000 to 10 lakhs. There were amendments in Section 4(3) of the Payment of Gratuity Act wherein the State extended this amount to CPF beneficiaries from 2010.  Per contra, the AGP contended that the Petitioner was covered by the CPF scheme and not entitled to gratuity.  The Bench noted that the Petitioner's retirement indicated that GPF was deducted from his salary. Therefore, he was governed by the GPF scheme. Additionally, in an earlier Civil Application with identical facts, the question of gratuity of Rs. 10 lakhs was raised. The High Court had then relied on H.Gangahanume Gowda Vs. Karnataka Agro Industries Corporation Ltd (2003) 3 SCC 40 to observe that the interest was payable on delayed payment of gratuity. It was also held that the same was "mandatory and not discretionary."   The Government had raised the amount of gratuity to Rs. 10 lakhs and the Petitioner therein had retired in 2011 was entitled to interest due to non-payment of gratuity worth Rs. 6.50 lakhs apart from 9% interest.  Noting that the Petitioner in the instant case had retired on 2013 "through no fault of his", the Bench opined that he was entitled to interest on the delayed payment of gratuity in accordance with D.D.Tiwari (D) Thr. Lrs vs Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam and other. Justice Vaishnav remarked,  "Since the petitioner superannuated on 14.06.2013 and the amount of gratuity has been wrongfully withheld by the respondents, the petitioner shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 9% from the date of his superannuation till the date of actual payment," it said.

The Supreme Court has held that the date of the receipt of the assessment order has no relevance in computing the limitation period for the Revision by the Principal Commissioner under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act.A Bench of Justices M.R.Shah and A.S.Bopanna made the above observation in Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai vs Mohammed Meeran Shahul Hameed- a case dealing with... The Supreme Court has held that the date of the receipt of the assessment order has no relevance in computing the limitation period for the Revision by the Principal Commissioner under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act. A Bench of Justices M.R.Shah and A.S.Bopanna made the above observation in Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai vs Mohammed Meeran Shahul Hameed- a case dealing with the calculation of limitation period under S.263 of the Income Tax Act.  Brief Factual Background  The respondent-assessee was served an assessment order under S.143 of the Income Tax Act in 2010. Soon thereafter, the Commissioner of Income Tax initiated revision proceedings under S.263 of the Act and an order was passed on 26.03.2012 holding that the assessment order was erroneous. The respondent-assessee received notice on 29.11.2012 and filed an appeal before the ITAT. The respondent-assessee argued that the order passed by the Commissioner was beyond the period of limitation mentioned under S.263(2). ITAT held that the revision order passed was beyond the limitation period and the Madras High Court in its impugned judgement upheld the order passed by the ITAT. The impugned judgement held that the date on which the assessee-respondent received the order was the relevant date for determining the period of limitation under S.263 (2) of the Act.  The Supreme Court, in a judgement authored by Justice M.R.Shah framed the primary question of law for the consideration as: whether the relevant date for the purpose of considering the period of limitation under S.263(2) of the IT Act would be the date on which the order is actually received by the assessee?  Answering the above question in negative, the Bench held that S.263 (2) of the Act requires that no revision order be made after the expiry of two years from the end of the financial year in which order sought to be revised was passed. Since S.263 uses the word made and not received, the Bench holds, the receipt of the order has no relevance for the purpose of determining limitation.  It holds:  "the word used is "made" and not the order "received" by the assessee. Even the word "dispatch" is not mentioned in Section 263 (2). Therefore, once it is established that the order under Section 263 was made/passed within the period of two years from the end of the financial year in which the order sought to be revised was passed, such an order cannot be said to be beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 263 (2) of the Act. Receipt of the order passed under Section 263 by the assessee has no relevance for the purpose of counting the period of limitation provided under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act.." (Para 4.3)  Thus, the judgement held that the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax dated 31.03.2012 is well within the limitation period prescribed under S.263. The receipt of the order on 29.11.2013 is irrelevant for the purpose of calculating limitation.  Case Title : Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai vs Mohammed Meeran Shahul Hameed      
The Delhi High Court has observed that the daughter-in-law can claim maintenance from her father-in-law provided she has inherited some estate of her husband.  A division bench comprising of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Neena Bansal Krishna dismissed a plea filed by a widowed daughter-in-law and grand-daughter under sec. 19 of the Family Court Act, 1984 against the order dated 3rd May, 2019 deferring their claim for interim maintenance in a petition under sec. 19 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. The appellant no.1 got married to the son of the respondents on 3rd December, 2011 and one daughter appellant No.2 was born from their wedlock on 1st October, 2012. Unfortunately, the husband expired on 14th December, 2013 and since the next day, wife along with her daughter shifted to her parental home.  According to the respondents, she neither returned nor did she remain in contact with the respondents, but filed a petition for maintenance after four years i.e on 23rd February, 2018. The appellant in her application for interim maintenance had asserted that she was not well educated and had no source of income to maintain herself or the daughter. It was stated that she totally dependent upon her old age ailing parents for her day to day needs.  She added that the respondent No.1 father-in-law was an educated person employed in MTNL department and was duty bound to take care of them. However, it was alleged that the respondents had intentionally and deliberately neglected them by not paying them anything towards their maintenance.  It was claimed that not only was the father in law getting his regular salary but was also earning about ₹20,000 per month from rent and his total monthly earnings were about ₹55000 to ₹65000. Accordingly, she claimed interim maintenance in the sum of ₹30,000 per month till the disposal of the main petition. The respondents on the other hand, had asserted that the appellants were not entitled to any maintenance under sec. 19 of the Act since there was no estate left behind by the deceased. The Family Court in the impugned order, observed that the appellant had failed to disclose about any estate left behind by her husband with the respondents from which the appellants could claim maintenance. The application was accordingly dismissed. The main ground of challenge before the High Court was that the widowed daughter-in-law and grand-daughter were entitled to claim maintenance from the father-in-law even if the property was self acquired by the parents-in-law or grandparents. It was claimed that the facts have not been appreciated in the right perspective and the maintenance has been wrongly denied to the appellants. "The appellant has failed to disclose any estate of her husband having devolved upon the respondents. Not only this, the respondent No.1 father-in-law has already expired. Now only respondent No.2 mother-in-law survives and the appellants cannot as a matter of right, claim any maintenance from her," the Court observed.  The Court was of the view that sec. 22 of the Act provided for maintenance of dependents of the deceased by the heirs of the deceased, however it was subject to the condition that they must have inherited the estate from the deceased. "As already noted above, no estate has been inherited either by the mother or the sister of the deceased husband of the appellant No.1 from which any maintenance can be claimed by the appellants. There is no infirmity in the impugned order of the learned Family Judge," the Court said.  Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed. Title: LAXMI & ANR v. SHYAM PRATAP & ANR    
Reversing the findings of a Motor Accident Tribunal which had fixed 50% contributory negligence on the truck driver against which the claimants' car had dashed, the Rajasthan High Court has directed the car insurance company to reimburse the payments made by insurer of the truck.Justice Birendra Kumar held that the Tribunal had passed the impugned order without taking note of the fact that... Reversing the findings of a Motor Accident Tribunal which had fixed 50% contributory negligence on the truck driver against which the claimants' car had dashed, the Rajasthan High Court has directed the car insurance company to reimburse the payments made by insurer of the truck. Justice Birendra Kumar held that the Tribunal had passed the impugned order without taking note of the fact that the driver of the truck had died two days before the accident and the claimants' car had dashed into the truck which was in the seizure of the police and was parked in soiled portion of the road leaving the pitch road completely free for movement. The bench thus ordered, "Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside to the extent that the Tribunal has fixed the liability to pay compensation on respondent Nos.2 and 3 i.e. owner and insurer of the truck. In fact, the liability was against the owner and insurer of car during use whereof the accident took place...Accordingly, the same is set aside and it is ordered that the entire liability to pay compensation goes against the owner and insurer of the car. Since the car was insured with respondent No.12 it is liable to pay entire compensation payable to the claimants...It has been informed that the appellant (truck insurer) has already paid Rs.5,10,500/- to the claimant. Therefore, the appellant would be entitled to be reimbursed by respondent No.12." Facts  Appellant-New India Assurance Company Ltd. was the insurer of the Truck. On 24.12.2007, the truck was dashed by a rash and negligent trolley which resulted in the death of driver Raghuvir Singh. The police with the help of JCB Crane dragged the damaged truck to the soiled portion of the road and the truck was left there under seizure of the police.  On 26.12.2007, driver Pawan Kumar along with others was driving the car, insured with Respondent No.12- Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. The FIR registered on 27.12.2007 revealed that Pawan Kumar was rash and negligent while driving the car on 26.12.2007 and dashed with the said truck from behind, resulting in death of Pawan Kumar and injury to others. After investigation, the police found that the accident was due to rash and negligent driving of Pawan Kumar. The legal representatives of victim Pawan Kumar brought Claim before MACT, Beawar.  The Tribunal found that the said accident was due to negligent parking of the truck without any flash light for guidance of other moving vehicles or any other sign showing stationed truck. In the result, the Tribunal fixed 50% liability on the truck and 50% contributory negligence on the deceased. The appellant is aggrieved by the impugned judgment dated 01.05.2012 passed in Claim Case No.78 of 2008/364 of 2011.  The court, while admitting this appeal., issued notice to Respondent No.12 only on the question whether the appellant-Assurance Company can be held liable to pay the compensation or it is the respondent No.12-Oriental Insurance Company, which should bear the liability of payment of compensation.  Findings  The court observed that there is no evidence that the truck was parked at the public place by its driver or the owner rather definite evidence is that the police crane had dragged the truck to the soiled portion of the road leaving the pitch road completely free for movement and the car had dashed going on the soiled portion of the road without any perceivable obstruction from any other vehicle. The court ruled that the accident was the result of the rash and negligent driving of the car.  The court opined that since the car was insured with respondent No.12 it is liable to pay entire compensation payable to the claimants. The court added that if there would be any violation of the terms and conditions of policy i.e. the driver of the car being without any license to drive the vehicle or without any proper license, respondent No.12 would be competent to recover from the owner of the car in a separately instituted proceeding after making payment to the claimant.  On finding that the appellant has already paid Rs.5,10,500/- to the claimant, the court observed that the appellant would be entitled to be reimbursed by respondent No.12. The court added respondent No.12 shall pay the aforesaid amount to the appellant alongwith interest paid by the appellant to the claimant on the aforesaid amount and that this exercise should be completed within three months to avoid 12% interest till recovery.  The court also opined,  "In the present case, admittedly the parking of the truck was not due to negligence of the driver or owner of the truck. The driver had already died in the accident two days ago. The damaged truck was dragged with the help of JCB crane to the side of the road on the soiled portion. These facts are not disputed. The claimant of this case unaware of the aforesaid factual position or by suppressing the aforesaid factual positions impleaded the dead driver Raguvir Singh as party to the claim petition."  Further, it was observed by the court that the truck was in the seizure of the police and no police official was impleaded as party to the claim petition. The police investigation report available on the record reveals that the accident was the result of sole negligence of the driver of the car, who was rash and negligent at the time of accident, added the court. The court found that the informant of the case is an eyewitness of the occurrence.  The court also rejected the judgments relied by the counsel for respondent no.12 and observed that In Raj Rani v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. [2009 (13) SCC 654], the driver of the truck had parked the truck on the mid of the road without any flash light or indicator working. In Shriram General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pushpa, again the driver of the lorry had parked half on the Tar road (pitch road). Likewise, in National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Mrs. Sunita Yadav [2007 (1) TAC 992 (Raj.)], the truck was parked by the driver without any reflectors, blinkers or indicators. Against the said truck a jeep with a moderate speed had collided.  The counsel for the appellants contended that the Tribunal wrongly fixed 50% negligence of the already damaged truck rather the accident was due to 100% negligence of the car driver. Moreover, the truck was under the seizure of the police, hence it could not have been held that the parking of the truck was the result of negligence of the driver or owner of the vehicle.  He further submitted that the owner of the truck Jaswant Singh was examined as NAW-2 in the claim case and he is specific that the crane brought by the police had dragged and shifted the truck to the soilly road by the side of the main pitch road. The police was not made party deliberately otherwise the entire matter would have surface before the Tribunal, he argued.  Adv. Praveen Jain appeared for the appellants, while Adv. Rishipal Agarwal and Adv. Jai Prakash Gupta appeared for the respondents.  Case Title: New India Assurance Company Ltd., through Regional Manager v. Smt. Kanchan Devi    
The Delhi High Court has held that the Limitation period of 3 years for seeking Appointment of Arbitrator commences from the date of expiry of 30 days period, reckoned from date of issuance of the notice invoking arbitration.Holding thus, it has allowed the Petitioner, Bharat Sachar Nigam Limited (BSNL), to proceed with Arbitration against the Respondent, WIPRO... The Delhi High Court has held that the Limitation period of 3 years for seeking Appointment of Arbitrator commences from the date of expiry of 30 days period, reckoned from date of issuance of the notice invoking arbitration. Holding thus, it has allowed the Petitioner, Bharat Sachar Nigam Limited (BSNL), to proceed with Arbitration against the Respondent, WIPRO Limited.  Background  The Petitioner and the Respondent executed Cooperation Agreements. Following expiry of warranty period mentioned therein, the Petitioner raised several issues regarding the products/services provided by the Respondent. In this regard, several emails were exchanged and the parties also met. However, Petitioner claims that the Respondents continued to fail to meet their contractual obligations.  Petitioners sent Legal Notice dated 21.12.2018 to Respondent to come up with resolution plan, however, no proper response was received.  Consequently, the Petitioner sent Legal Notice dated 14.3.2019 to Respondent invoking Arbitration under Clause 18 of the Agreement seeking consent for sole Appointment of Arbitrator. However, the same was not responded to. Thus, the Petitioners approached the Court with this Petition.  The seat of the Arbitration  During the court proceedings, Respondents raised several objections as to the maintainability of the Petition, respecting the jurisdiction of the Court, the expiry of the limitation period for the institution of Petition, the time-barred nature of claims, and objections to the merits of Petitioner's claims.  The jurisdictional claim mainly rested on the issue of the "Seat" of Arbitration. It was contended that the Arbitral Clause contained in Para 18.2.1 mentioned "Place" of Arbitration as New Delhi without specifying the seat. Further, the Agreement was executed in Gurugram, the parties did not work for gain in New Delhi, the payments were not received in Delhi, and the occurrences of the breaches also did not occur in Delhi. Issues of Seat and Venue (Place) being two different things, the Place of Arbitration could not confer the status of Juridical Seat/Jurisdiction of this Court.  Rejecting this submission, the Court cited BGS SGS Soma JV v. NHPC (2020), where it was held that an arbitration clause designating a place of Arbitration as the venue of all arbitration proceedings, it is to be implied as to the seat of the Arbitration. This is in contrast to a clause simply indicating one or more individual hearings at a place, but proceedings as a whole, including the arbitral award. Relying on this, this Court rejected the Petitioner's contention the Court did not have jurisdiction as seat and place are different issues. The Court affirmed its jurisdiction to hear this case on the basis that place of Arbitration in the arbitral clause as New Delhi was indicative of the seat of the Arbitration.  Limitation Period  The Respondent averred that the filing of the Petition ought to be rejected as the claims were time-barred. The Petition, being for the Appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the Court cited BSNL v. Nortel Network (2021) of the Supreme Court. The Case dealt with the issue of determining the limitation period in filing a petition under Section 11. It was cited that,  "It is now fairly well-settled that the Limitation for filing an application under Section 11 would arise upon the failure to make the Appointment of the arbitrator within a period of 30 days from issuance of the notice invoking Arbitration. In other words, an application under Section 11 can be filed only after a notice of Arbitration in respect of the particular claim(s)/dispute(s) to be referred to Arbitration [as contemplated by Section 21 of the Act] is made, and there is failure to make the Appointment. The period of Limitation for filing a petition seeking Appointment of an arbitrator(s) cannot be confused or conflated with the period of Limitation applicable to the substantive claims made in the underlying commercial contract. The period of Limitation for such claims is prescribed under various Articles of the Limitation Act, 1963. The Limitation for deciding the underlying substantive disputes is necessarily distinct from that of filing an application for Appointment of an arbitrator……. The effect being that the period of Limitation to file an application under Section 11 is 3 years from the date of refusal to appoint the arbitrator, or on expiry of 30 days, whichever is earlier."  Applying this precedent, the Court noted that the Legal Notice invoking Arbitration was dated 14.3.2019. The period of replying to the Legal Notice expired within 30 days of this Notice, i.e., 13.4.2019. The period of Limitation starts from this date and is extended till 3 years. Since the Petition was filed on 24.5.2019, it was held that there was no delay in filing this Petition. Accordingly, the ratio that comes from this holding is: The Period of Limitation of 3 years for filing Petition for Appointment of Arbitrator runs from the date of expiry of the period for replying to a Legal Notice seeking the Appointment by the party.  Time-Barred claims  The Respondent averred that the Petitioner lost its right to cause of action as the claims were time-barred. The Agreement dated 20.3.2009 conferred warranty for 3 years from the date of commissioning. Accordingly, the claims being not arbitrable, ought to be rejected. The Respondents claimed that the maximum period of Limitation expired in December 2017. The Respondent argued that the Petitioner was trying to revive dead claims, and there is no continuing cause of action. Even if the exchange of emails is assumed, since the purported email was sent in 2016 and the Notice invoking Arbitration was in 2019, the period of Limitation had expired.  The Court again referred to BSNL v. Nortel Network. The cited case dealt with a notice of Arbitration issued after 5.5 years of rejection of Arbitration. The Court, in the instant case, distinguished facts to the present case as in the cited case there were no intervening facts in the notice of Arbitration nor the Petition filed under Section 11. Even so, the Court noted the cited Supreme Court's Case's observations regarding purported time bar of arbitrability of claims:  "It is only in the very limited category of cases, where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that the Court may decline to make ARB.P. 365/2021 Page 19 of 21 the reference. However, if there is even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the disputes to Arbitration, otherwise, it would encroach upon what is essentially a matter to be determined by the tribunal."  Applying these observations, this Court found that the facts of this case gave rise to a continuing cause of action, arising from the persistent demands of the Petitioners to seek resolution of disputes within the warranty period. The warranty was till 24.6.2015. Petitioners had raised several emails during this warranty period from 1.9.2015 to 26.10.2016. Meetings held between the parties in 2018 bore no fruit, per the Petitioner's claims. The Petitioner first sent Legal Notice seeking a resolution plan on 21.12.2018. This was replied to on 3.1.2019 with a commitment for future details. However, these were not provided. Accordingly, given the unresolved claims the facts presenting a continuing cause of action due to persistent demands of the Petitioners, the claims were deemed subject to Arbitration per BSNL. All outstanding claims regarding the minute details of emails, outcomes of meetings, etc., by the parties would accordingly be subject to Arbitration.  Held, the Petition was allowed, and Justice (Retd.) G.S. Sistani was appointed as sole arbitrator.  Case Title: Huawei Telecommunications (India) Co. Pvt. Ltd. & Anr v. WIPRO Ltd.

The Supreme Court observed that it is not permissible to rewrite the contract while interpreting the terms of the Insurance Policy. The bench of  Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Bela M. Trivedi said that the terms of insurance policy have to be strictly construed. In a contract of insurance there is a requirement of Uberrima fides i.e. good faith on the part of the assured, the court said. The complainant's husband had taken a life insurance policy under the Jeevan Suraksha Yojana on 14.04.2021 from the Life Insurance Corporation, under which a sum of Rs. 3,75,000/- was assured by the corporation, and in case of death by accident an additional sum of Rs. 3,75,000/- was also assured. He met with an accident and succumbed to the injuries on 21.03.2012. The complainant after the death of her husband filed a claim before LIC. She was paid a sum of Rs. 3,75,000/- , but the additional amount of Rs. 3,75,000/- towards the Accident claim benefit was not paid. The complainant, therefore, approached the District Forum by filing a complaint seeking the said amount towards the Accident claim benefit. LIC contended that the day when the husband of the complainant met with an accident, the said policy had already lapsed on account of non-payment of the due premium. The complaint was allowed by the District Forum. The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission allowed the appeal. But, the National Commission Disputes Redressal Commission restored the order passed by District Forum. Before the Apex Court, LIC contended that condition no. 11 of the Policy clearly stipulated that the policy has to be in force when the accident takes place. The policy had lapsed on 14.10.2011 and was not in force on the date of accident i.e. on 06.03.2012. It was sought to be revived on 09.03.2012 after the accident in question, and that too without disclosing the fact of accident which had taken place on 06.03.2012. Taking note of this fact, the bench observed:  It is not disputed that the husband of the complainant had taken the life insurance policy on 14.04.2011, that the next premium had fallen due on 14.10.2011 but was not paid by him, that the husband of the complainant met with an accident on 06.03.2012, that thereafter the premium was paid on 09.03.2012 and that he expired on 21.03.2012. It is also not disputed that at the time of making payment of premium on 09.03.2012, it was not disclosed by the complainant or her husband to the appellant-Corporation about the accident which had taken placed on 06.03.2012. The said conduct on the part of the complainant and her husband in not disclosing about the accident to the corporation not only amounted to suppression of material fact and lacked bona fides but smacked of their mala fide intention, and therefore, the Accident benefit claim of the complainant was liable to be rejected on the said ground alone. It is well settled legal position that in a contract of insurance there is a requirement of Uberrima fides i.e. good faith on the part of the assured.  The court further observed thus, by referring to Vikram Greentech (I) Ltd. V/s New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (2009) 5 SCC 599: From the afore-stated legal position, it is clear that the terms of insurance policy have to be strictly construed, and it is not permissible to rewrite the contract while interpreting the terms of the Policy. In the instant case, condition no. 11 of the Policy clearly stipulated that the policy has to be in force when the accident takes place The court observed that the Accident benefit could have been claimed and availed of only if the accident had taken place subsequent to the renewal of the policy. Having held thus, it allowed the appeal and dismissed the complaint.   Case no. and Date: SLP(C) 13868 OF 2019 | 29 October 2021 Coram: Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Bela M. Trivedi         
The Supreme Court recently acquitted a person, who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and pay Rs 1 lakh fine for the offence of possessing charas. Granting him benefit of doubt due to the lacunae and gaps in the prosecution, a bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and JK Maheshwari set aside the conviction of the appellant under Section 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The appellant was sentenced by by Special Judge District Kullu, Himachal Pradesh, and the sentence was upheld by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh. The Supreme Court noted that the site plan/spot map, which was prepared at the spot where the recovery of the drugs was made, was wrong and incorrect. The bench observed that Head Constable (PW-4) had in its cross examination has accepted the site plan was wrongly prepared. The nakabandi and even the place where the appellant had allegedly thrown the rucksack was also stated wrong. The bench had also noted that another Head Constable (PW-5) who is the Investigating Officer had also accepted in the cross examination that the site plan was incorrect. The bench observed that the prosecution has also not been able to show and prove the author of the arrest memo and the personal body search memo. PW-4 accepted that he had not put his signatures on the arrest memo or personal body search memo though his name was mentioned as an attesting witness. The bench also noted that the PW-4 had professed that the arrest memo was prepared by PW-5 however the PW-5 proffered that he is not the author of the arrest memo and the personal body search memo. The bench also noted that the appellant had made the plea that he was arrested from the bus stand while he was waiting to board a bus. One unclaimed bag was found under a bench in which charas was found. It was the stand of the appellant that he was falsely implicated and there were no public witnesses as per the Police. "In view of the aforesaid lacunae and gaps in the case of the prosecution, when taken collectively and together, we feel, that the conviction of the appellant under Section 20 of the NDPS Act cannot be sustained. The appellant must be given benefit of doubt", the bench noted. Amar Chand vs. State of Himachal Pradesh – C. A. No. 2035/2022 arising out of SLP (Crl.)

The Karnataka High Court has quashed criminal proceedings pending against a man holding that the FIR lodged by the complainant was 45 days after the alleged incident of assault and no plausible explanation was given for the delayed filing of FIR.  A single judge bench of Justice Hemant Chandangoudar allowed the petition filed by B.Durga Ram and quashed the proceedings initiated against him for offences punishable under sections 323, 504, 506, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.  Case Details:  The FIR was lodged by the 2nd respondent alleging that one Tulasa Ram – accused No.1 was due a sum of Rs.66,00,000/- and he had lodged the FIR against the accused No.1 before the Halasoor Gate Police Station.  When the respondent No.2 (Babu Lal) and accused No.1 met at Prakash Café as to settle the matter, at that point of time, the accused No.1 and petitioner –accused No.2 herein, abused the 2nd respondent in filthy language and gave threat to his life and also assaulted him with their hands.  The police after investigation, submitted the chargesheet against the petitioner and others. The Magistrate after accepting the chargesheet, took cognizance for the aforesaid offences and issued summons to the petitioner – accused.  Petitioner's submissions:  The alleged incident had taken place 45 days prior to lodging of the FIR. However, there is no plausible explanation offered in the FIR for the delay in lodging the FIR. Further, in the absence of any statement of the employees or customers in the Prakash Café, recorded under Section 161 of IPC, the chargesheet filed by the police in the absence of any corroborative material is without any substance.  Respondent opposed the plea:  The chargesheet material clearly discloses the commission of the aforesaid offences alleged against the petitioner and the same does not warrant any interference by this Court.  Findings:  The bench relied on the Supreme Court judgment in the case of State of AP vs. M.Madhusudhan Rao, reported in (2008) 15 SCC 582 and said, "The FIR was lodged alleging that one and half months back the petitioner and other accused abused him in filthy language and assaulted him. In the absence of any plausible explanation offered by the 2nd respondent – informant, the FIR lodged against the petitioner – accused is with malice and without any probable cause."  As regards the sections invoked against the petitioner the court said,  "To constitute the commission of the offence punishable under Section 323 of IPC, the police have not placed any material that the respondent No.2 sustained any simple injuries due to the alleged assault made by the petitioner – accused. To constitute the commission of offence punishable under Section 504 and 506 of IPC, the intention of insult must be of such a degree to provoke breach of public peace or commission of any other offence. In the present case, the abusive language alleged to have been used by the petitioner – accused has not caused breach of public peace or commission of any other offences."  Following which it held,  "It would be an abuse of process of law, if the criminal proceedings are allowed to be continued against the petitioners, since the probability of conviction of the petitioner – accused No.2 is remote and bleak."  Accordingly it allowed the petition.  Case Title: B.DURGA RAM v. The State By BENGALURU CITY CENTRAL P.S.

The Karnataka High Court while quashing a case registered by a woman against her ex-husband and in-laws under section 498-A (dowry harassment) said the charge sheet filed on the basis of omnibus and general allegations is without any substance.  A single judge bench of Justice Hemant Chandangoudar allowed the petition filed by Dr. Shahul Hameed Valavoor and others and quashed the prosecution registered under sections 498 A read with Section 34 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.  As per the prosecution, the couple married in 2009 in accordance with Islamic customs and tradition and thereafter they resided at the marital home along with other accused. It was alleged that accused No.1 (husband) and respondent No.2 (complainant) along with the child went to the USA in the month of December-2011. They returned to India in the year 2016 and during their stay in India, respondent No.2 was harassed by accused to bring dowry for the purpose of higher education of accused No.1 in USA. In February 2017, respondent No.2 went back to the USA along with the child but later on was forcibly sent back to India, it was alleged.  In May 2018, she went to the house of accused Nos.2 to 4 but was denied entry, it was further alleged.  Findings:  The bench noted that it is also undisputed that the marriage of respondent No.2 with accused No.1 was dissolved by the IOWA Court at USA and permanent alimony has been deposited in the bank account of respondent No.2 which clearly implies that marriage of accused No.1 with respondent No.2 was dissolved. The contention that the order was obtained fraudulently without issuing notice to respondent No.2 cannot be considered in this petition.  "Hence, the marriage of respondent No.2 having been dissolved with accused No.1, the charge sheet filed against accused is without any substance. In the absence of any essential ingredients so as to constitute the commission of offences alleged against the petitioners-accused, the charge sheet filed is not sustainable."  Further it said, "Even otherwise, except omnibus and general allegations there are no specific allegations as to how and in what manner each of the accused subjected respondent No.2 to cruelty or assaulted her. Hence, the charge sheet filed on the basis of omnibus and general allegations is also without any substance."  The bench then opined that the dispute between the parties arises out of marital discord, however, given a criminal texture so as to pressurise the petitioners/accused to arrive at settlement.  Further the bench said respondent No.2 returned to India in February 2018 but the FIR was lodged only in May 2018, without offering any explanation. "Hence, it is implied that the FIR was lodged against accused Nos.2 to 4 with an ulterior motive to wreak vengeance and with revengeful intent."  Accordingly, it allowed the petition.

The Supreme Court observed that a court while deciding an issue of child custody cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child."A writ Court while dealing with the issue of habeas corpus cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child. If such orders are passed against the wishes of a parent, it will offend her/his right to privacy",... The Supreme Court observed that a court while deciding an issue of child custody cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child. "A writ Court while dealing with the issue of habeas corpus cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child. If such orders are passed against the wishes of a parent, it will offend her/his right to privacy", the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed. In this case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court issued several directions while allowing a petition for habeas corpus filed by the husband seeking custody of the minor child. The mother was directed to return to USA along with minor child on or before 30.09.2021. The following were the directions issued by the High Court: "(i) respondent No.2 is directed to return to USA along with minor child on or before 30.09.2021;  (ii) in case respondent No.2 opts to return to USA, the petitioner shall bear the travel and incidental expenses of respondent No.2 and the minor child for return to and also the expenses for their stay in USA till decision of the custody petition and the petitioner shall not initiate any criminal/contempt proceedings against respondent No.2 for inter country removal of the minor child;  (iii) if respondent No.2 fails to comply with aforesaid direction, respondent No.2 shall hand over custody of the minor child and his passport to the petitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other date as may be agreed to by the petitioner;  (iv) in case respondent No.2 fails to hand over custody of the minor child and her passport to the petitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other date as may be agreed to by the petitioner, respondent No.1 shall take over the custody and passport of the minor child from respondent No.2 and hand over custody and passport of the minor child to the petitioner on such date as may be agreed to by the petitioner;  (v) on custody of the minor child and his passport being handed over to the petitioner, the petitioner shall be entitled to take the minor child to USA;  (vi) in case passport of the minor child is not handed over to the petitioner or respondent No.1 by respondent No.2 on the ground of loss/damage etc., the petitioner shall be entitled to get the duplicate passport issued from the concerned authority; and (vii) on such return of the minor child to USA, either of the parties shall be at liberty to revive the proceedings before US Court for appropriate orders regarding appointment of guardian and grant of custody of the minor child."  Challenging this order, the mother approached the Apex Court. On behalf of mother, it was contended that the welfare principle would mean balancing the interests of all the members of the child's family. It was contended that the mother as the primary caregiver must be kept in mind as a person who has legal rights which must be respected and protected. An article by Mr.John Ekelaar which some criticism of "the welfare principle" was relied upon. Addressing this contention, the bench referred to Kanika Goel v. the State of Delhi (2018) 9 SCC 578  and Prateek Gupta v. Shilpi Gupta (2018) 2 SCC 309 and observed that the rights of the parents are irrelevant when a Court decides the issue of custody of their minor child. The bench thus considered the issue as to whether the Court can compel one of the parents to move from one country to another? In this regard, the bench observed thus: The Courts, in such proceedings, cannot decide where the parents should reside as it will affect the right to privacy of the parents. We may note here that a writ Court while dealing with the issue of habeas corpus cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child. If such orders are passed against the wishes of a parent, it will offend her/his right to privacy. A parent has to be given an option to go abroad with the child. It ultimately depends on the parent concerned to decide and opt for giving a company to the minor child for the sake of the welfare of the child. It will all depend on the priorities of the concerned parent. The court therefore modified the directions issued by the High Court: (i) It will be open for the appellant no.1 to travel to USA along with the minor child and to contest the proceedings pending in USA. If the appellant no.1 is willing to travel to USA along with the minor child, she will communicate her willingness to do so to the respondent no.1 by email within a period of fifteen days from today. The appellant no.1 shall communicate to the respondent no.1 the possible dates on which she proposes to travel along with the minor child. The possible dates shall be within three months from today; (ii) On receiving an intimation as aforesaid, the respondent no.1 shall book air tickets after consulting the appellant no.1. The respondent no.1 shall make proper arrangements for separate stay of the appellant no.1 in USA after consulting her. The arrangements for residence shall be made at the cost of 36 the respondent no.1. As and when the appellant no.1 wants to return to India, it shall be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay for her air tickets. If she wishes to continue in USA, the respondent no.1 shall take all possible steps for the extension of visa or for getting a new visa; (iii) In the event the appellant no.1 agrees to travel to USA along with the minor son, it will be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay a sufficient amount per month to the appellant no.1 for maintenance of herself and the minor son. Along with the air tickets, the respondent no.1 shall remit US$ 6,500 to the appellant no.1 by a mutually convenient mode. The amount shall be utilised by the appellant no.1 to meet initial expenditure in USA. After the expiry of period of one month from the date on which the appellant no.1 arrives in USA, the respondent no.1 shall regularly remit a mutually agreed amount to the appellant no.1 for maintenance. If there be any dispute, the parties are free to adopt remedy in accordance with law. The respondent no.1 shall provide proper medical insurance to the appellant no.1 and the minor child while they are in USA. Moreover, the respondent no.1 shall be under an obligation to provide proper medical treatment to the minor child; (iv) In the event, the appellant no.1 along with the minor child visits USA in terms of this order, for a period of three months from the date of her arrival, the respondent no.1 shall not take any steps to implement or enforce the order dated 3rd February 2020 passed by the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas which will enable the appellant no.1 to move the concerned Court for contesting the petition filed by the respondent no.1 and to file appropriate proceedings. A written undertaking to that effect shall be filed by the respondent no.1 in this Court within two weeks from today. Thus, for the said period of three months, the custody of the minor shall remain with the appellant no.1; (v) After the appellant no.1 and minor child reach USA, subject to the orders which may be passed by the competent Court in USA, for a period of 3 months from their arrival, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to have temporary custody of the minor child from 10 am to 5 pm on every Sunday or as 38 mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1. In addition, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to make a video call to talk to the minor child for about half an hour on every day (except Sunday) between 5 pm to 6 pm; (vi) In the event, the appellant no.1 is not willing to visit USA along with her minor son and fails to communicate her willingness to visit USA within a period of fifteen days from today, it will be open for the respondent no.1 to take custody of the child. After the respondent no.1 visits India, the appellant no.1 shall hand over the custody of the minor child to him and the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to take the minor child with him to USA. In such an event, the appellant no.1 will be entitled to talk to the minor child on video call for half an hour on every day between 5 pm to 6 pm (USA time) or at such time as mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1; (vii) As observed by the High Court in paragraph 58 of the impugned Judgment, an option of adopting agreed joint parenting plan remains open to the parties. If they wish to do  so, they can always file appropriate application before the High Court; and (viii) This order shall not be construed to mean that any final adjudication has been made on the rights of the parties.

The Supreme Court observed that the income tax returns may not be an accurate guide of the real income of parties engaged in a matrimonial conflict. Family Court has to determine the real income on a holistic assessment of the evidence before it, the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli said. In this case, the Family Court ordered a Husband to pay maintenance at the rate of Rs 20,000 per month to his wife and Rs 15,000 each to their daughters. This was based on a finding that he is earning Rs. 2 lacs as monthly income. While considering the revision petition filed by the Husband, the High Court noticed as per the Income Tax Return (I.T.R.) filed by thim he is only earning Rs. 4.5 lacs per annum. It was further observed that the Family Court had not indicated the basis on which it had assessed his income at Rs Two Lakhs per month In appeal, the Apex Court bench, observed: "On the first aspect, it is well-settled that income tax returns do not necessarily furnish an accurate guide of the real income. Particularly, when parties are engaged in a matrimonial conflict, there is a tendency to underestimate income. Hence, it is for the Family Court to determine on a holistic assessment of the evidence what would be the real income of the second respondent so as to enable the appellants to live in a condition commensurate with the status to which they were accustomed during the time when they were staying together. The two children are aged 17 and 15 years, respectively, and their needs have to be duly met". The bench said that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the order of the Family Court on this ground. The court therefore restored the Revision petition to the file of the High Court for fresh consideration.

The Madras High Court recently allowed an appeal for quashing criminal proceedings against one Francis Raja accused of forgery and cheating. The court made the order after raising suspicion about the manner in which the further investigation was conducted, especially by the Deputy Superintendent of Police.Justice Nirmal Kumar observed as under:"The act of the Deputy Superintendent... The Madras High Court recently allowed an appeal for quashing criminal proceedings against one Francis Raja accused of forgery and cheating. The court made the order after raising suspicion about the manner in which the further investigation was conducted, especially by the Deputy Superintendent of Police. Justice Nirmal Kumar  observed as under: "The act of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam Sub Division, Coimbatore is not acceptable and it is abuse of process of law. Earlier, the 2nd respondent filed a petition before the Labour Court seeking identical relief, which was negatived. Thereafter, the present cause of action initiated, which is not acceptable, proper and that cannot be approved." In the present case, the petitioner was employed as Machine Operator in the 2nd respondent company M/s.Micro Electric Controls. It was alleged that on 29.07.1998, the petitioner gave a resignation letter to the 2nd respondent company saying that he was unable to continue work. On 30.07.1998, the petitioner's dues were stated to have been settled and he was relieved from the service. However, the petitioner filed a case before the Labour Court, Coimbatore stating that the signature in the resignation letter is a forged one. He claimed that he used to sign without any line, while the signature in the resignation letter had a line under it. The same was disposed of in favour of the petitioner. A series of litigation followed challenging the appeal, and all ended in favour of the petitioner.The petitioner then filed a petition in the labour court seeking arrears of his wages and to comply with the order of the court, which was allowed. In the meanwhile, an application filed by the respondent company for sending documents for forensic examination was dismissed.The company had also filed an FIR against the petitioner in 2003 for offences under sections 457 and 420 of the IPC. The same was closed in 2004 as a mistake of fact as the company failed to produce the original resignation letter. After the proceedings before the Labour Court and the High Court, the company obtained the original resignation letter and filed a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC before the Trial Court. The Trial Court informed the company that the case records were destroyed in 2006. The company then filed another petition for the reconstruction of records. Both the applications were allowed by the Trial Court. On further investigation, the documents were sent for forensic examination wherein the experts confirmed that the signature in the resignation letter was that of the petitioner. Accordingly, the police filed a final report stating that the petitioner had committed forgery and cheating. Finding a prima facie case, the trial court took the case on file against which the present quash petition was filed.The court observed a lot of defects in the manner in which further investigation was carried out. The police had conducted preliminary enquiry even before an order of reconstruction and further investigation was passed. The order was passed on 06.02.2013 and was communicated to the police only on  19.06.2014. However, the Forensic Department acknowledged the receipt of the documents as early as on  27.11.2012 and the report of the Forensic Department was  dated 09.04.2012. The court also observed that the fee for the examination of documents was paid by the Deputy Superintendent  of Police which was not the usual procedure. It was also noted that no specimen signature was obtained from the petitioner and the Forensic Report was silent with respect to the comparison of the underline in the signature, which was the crux of the case. The court, therefore, opined that no case could be made out from the Forensic Report as the same was made without any study on the underline of the signatures. The court observed that the Trial Court ought to have noted the manner in which the Deputy Superintendent of Police had carried out the investigation when the case had already been closed as a mistake of fact. Finding that the  act of the Deputy Superintendent of Police was not in a manner known to the law, the court remarked that the entire further investigation was a tainted and coloured one. The court thus ordered for quashing of the proceedings before the Judicial Magistrate. Case Title:  G.Francis Raja v.  State and another Case No:  Crl. O.P.
