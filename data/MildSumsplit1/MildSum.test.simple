The Karnataka High Court recently directed a husband to pay Rs 25,000 as litigation expenses to allow the wife to engage an advocate and to contest the proceedings filed by him seeking dissolution of marriage.

The Karnataka High Court recently directed a husband to pay Rs 25,000 as litigation expenses to allow the wife to engage an advocate and to contest the proceedings filed by him seeking dissolution of marriage. A single-judge bench of Justice S G Pandit said,"I deem it proper and appropriate to direct respondent-Husband to pay a sum of Rs.25,000, towards litigation expenses to the petitioner-wife." The couple got married on 26.12.2011, and from the marriage, they have two children. The husband respondent filed a petition under 13(1) (i) and (ia) of the Act seeking dissolution of marriage. In the said proceedings the wife filed an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, claiming litigation expenses of Rs.75,000, to engage the advocate and to contest the proceedings. The trial court rejected the application holding that it is for the petitioner-wife to approach District Legal Service Authority for legal assistance and there is no provision to direct the respondent-Husband to pay litigation expenses. Following this, the wife approached the high court and the husband approached the court seeking expeditious disposal of the petitioner. It was submitted on behalf of the wife that the respondent-Husband is working as Head of Human Resources and receiving a salary of more than Rs.80,000, per month. The petitioner-wife has no income of her own and it is submitted that the petitioner wife is looking after two children. In the above circumstances, the respondent-Husband is liable to pay some amount towards litigation expenses. The bench considered the submissions and said, "The amount which is sought for by the petitioner-Wife i.e., Rs.75,000/- as litigation expenses are on the higher side. I deem it proper and appropriate to direct respondent-Husband to pay a sum of Rs.25,000 towards litigation expenses to the petitioner-wife." Further, the court directed the parties to cooperate with the trial Court for the early disposal of the case. The trial court was directed to dispose of the plea filed by the husband seeking dissolution of marriage in an expeditious manner. 
The Supreme Court has observed that the rights of the parents are irrelevant when a Court decides the issue of custody of their minor child.The issue of custody of a minor, whether in a petition seeking habeas corpus or in a custody petition, has to be decided on the touchstone of the principle that the welfare of a minor is of paramount consideration, the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and... The Supreme Court has observed that the rights of the parents are irrelevant when a Court decides the issue of custody of their minor child. The issue of custody of a minor, whether in a petition seeking habeas corpus or in a custody petition, has to be decided on the touchstone of the principle that the welfare of a minor is of paramount consideration, the bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed. In this case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court issued several directions while allowing a petition for habeas corpus filed by the husband seeking custody of the minor child. The mother was directed to return to USA along with minor child on or before 30.09.2021. Challenging this order, the mother approached the Apex Court. On behalf of the mother, it was contended that the welfare principle would mean balancing the interests of all the members of the child's family. It was contended that the mother as the primary caregiver must be kept in mind as a person who has legal rights which must be respected and protected. An article by Mr.John Ekelaar which some criticism of "the welfare principle" was relied upon. Addressing this contention, the bench referred to Kanika Goel v. the State of Delhi (2018) 9 SCC 578  and Prateek Gupta v. Shilpi Gupta (2018) 2 SCC 309 "The decision of this Court in the case of Kanika (supra) reiterates the well-settled law that the issue regarding custody of a minor child and the issue of the repatriation of the child to the native country has to be addressed on the sole criteria of the welfare of the minor and not on consideration of the legal rights of the parents. The principle that the welfare of the minor shall be the predominant consideration and that the rights of the parties to a custody dispute are irrelevant has been consistently followed by this Court. " The court noted that, in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (for short "the 1956 Act"), it is provided that in appointment or declaration of a guardian of a minor, the welfare of the minor shall be the paramount consideration. The court made the following observations: The consideration of the well-being and welfare of the child must get precedence over the individual or personal rights of the parents. 26...When a Court decides that it is in the best interest of the minor to remain in the custody of one of the parents, the rights of the other parent are bound to be affected. As provided in clause (a) of Section 6 of the 1956 Act, in the case of a minor boy or girl, the natural guardian is the father, but ordinarily, the custody of a minor who has not completed the age of 5 years shall be with the mother. On a conjoint reading of sub-section (1) of Section 13 read with clause (a) of Section 6 of the 1959 Act, if it is found that the welfare of a minor whose age is more than 5 years requires that his custody should be with the mother, the Court is bound to do so. In the same way, if interest of the minor which is the paramount consideration requires that the custody of a minor child should not be with the mother, the Court will be justified in disturbing the custody of 24 the mother even if the age of the minor is less than five years. In such cases, the rights of the father or the mother, as the case may be, conferred by clause (a) of Section 6 are bound to be affected. Whenever the Court disturbs the custody of one parent, unless there are compelling reasons, the Court will normally provide for visitation rights to the other parent. The reason is that the child needs the company of both parents. The orders for visitation rights are essentially passed for the welfare of minors and for the protection of their right of having the company of both parents. Such orders are not passed only for protecting the rights of the parents. In view of the settled legal position, the welfare of the minor being the paramount consideration, we cannot act upon the suggestions of Mr.John Ekelaar in his Article. We cannot accept the submission that while applying the welfare principle, the rights of the mother or father need to be protected. The consideration of the well-being and welfare of the child must get precedence over the individual or personal rights of the parents. Rights of the parties litigating over the custody issue are irrelevant 27. Each case has to be decided on its own facts and circumstances. Though no hard and fast rule can be laid down, in the cases of Kanika  (supra) and Nithya (supra), this Court has laid down the parameters for exercise of the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus under Article 226 of the Constitution of India dealing with cases of minors brought to India from the country of their native. This Court has reiterated that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the minor child and the rights of the parties litigating over the custody issue are irrelevant. After laying down the principles, in the case of Nithya (supra), this Court has clarified that the decision of the Court in each case must depend on the totality of facts and circumstances of the case brought before it. The factual aspects are required to be tested on the touchstone of the principle of welfare of the minor child. In the cases of Lahiri (supra) and Yashita (supra), the Benches of this Court consisting of two Judges have not made a departure from the law laid down in the decisions of larger Benches of this Court in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra). The Benches have applied the law laid down by the larger Bench to the facts of the cases before them. It is not necessary for us to discuss in detail the facts of the aforesaid cases. By its very nature, in a custody case, the facts cannot be similar. What is in the welfare of the child depends on several factors. A custody dispute involves human issues which are always complex and complicated. There can never be a straight jacket formula to decide the issue of custody  of a minor child as what is in the paramount interest of a minor is always a question of fact. But the parameters for exercise of jurisdiction as laid down in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) will have to be followed. The bench also considered the issue as to whether the Court can compel one of the parents to move from one country to another? In this regard, the bench observed thus: The Courts, in such proceedings, cannot decide where the parents should reside as it will affect the right to privacy of the parents. We may note here that a writ Court while dealing with the issue of habeas corpus cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child. If such orders are passed against the wishes of a parent, it will offend her/his right to privacy. A parent has to be given an option to go abroad with the child. It ultimately depends on the parent concerned to decide and opt for giving a company to the minor child for the sake of the welfare of the child. It will all depend on the priorities of the concerned parent. The court therefore modified the directions issued by the High Court: (i) It will be open for the appellant no.1 to travel to USA along with the minor child and to contest the proceedings pending in USA. If the appellant no.1 is willing to travel to USA along with the minor child, she will communicate her willingness to do so to the respondent no.1 by email within a period of fifteen days from today. The appellant no.1 shall communicate to the respondent no.1 the possible dates on which she proposes to travel along with the minor child. The possible dates shall be within three months from today; (ii) On receiving an intimation as aforesaid, the respondent no.1 shall book air tickets after consulting the appellant no.1. The respondent no.1 shall make proper arrangements for separate stay of the appellant no.1 in USA after consulting her. The arrangements for residence shall be made at the cost of 36 the respondent no.1. As and when the appellant no.1 wants to return to India, it shall be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay for her air tickets. If she wishes to continue in USA, the respondent no.1 shall take all possible steps for the extension of visa or for getting a new visa; (iii) In the event the appellant no.1 agrees to travel to USA along with the minor son, it will be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay a sufficient amount per month to the appellant no.1 for maintenance of herself and the minor son. Along with the air tickets, the respondent no.1 shall remit US$ 6,500 to the appellant no.1 by a mutually convenient mode. The amount shall be utilised by the appellant no.1 to meet initial expenditure in USA. After the expiry of period of one month from the date on which the appellant no.1 arrives in USA, the respondent no.1 shall regularly remit a mutually agreed amount to the appellant no.1 for maintenance. If there be any dispute, the parties are free to adopt remedy in accordance with law. The respondent no.1 shall provide proper medical insurance to the appellant no.1 and the minor child while they are in USA. Moreover, the respondent no.1 shall be under an obligation to provide proper medical treatment to the minor child; (iv) In the event, the appellant no.1 along with the minor child visits USA in terms of this order, for a period of three months from the date of her arrival, the respondent no.1 shall not take any steps to implement or enforce the order dated 3rd February 2020 passed by the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas which will enable the appellant no.1 to move the concerned Court for contesting the petition filed by the respondent no.1 and to file appropriate proceedings. A written undertaking to that effect shall be filed by the respondent no.1 in this Court within two weeks from today. Thus, for the said period of three months, the custody of the minor shall remain with the appellant no.1; (v) After the appellant no.1 and minor child reach USA, subject to the orders which may be passed by the competent Court in USA, for a period of 3 months from their arrival, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to have temporary custody of the minor child from 10 am to 5 pm on every Sunday or as 38 mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1. In addition, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to make a video call to talk to the minor child for about half an hour on every day (except Sunday) between 5 pm to 6 pm; (vi) In the event, the appellant no.1 is not willing to visit USA along with her minor son and fails to communicate her willingness to visit USA within a period of fifteen days from today, it will be open for the respondent no.1 to take custody of the child. After the respondent no.1 visits India, the appellant no.1 shall hand over the custody of the minor child to him and the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to take the minor child with him to USA. In such an event, the appellant no.1 will be entitled to talk to the minor child on video call for half an hour on every day between 5 pm to 6 pm (USA time) or at such time as mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1; (vii) As observed by the High Court in paragraph 58 of the impugned Judgment, an option of adopting agreed joint parenting plan remains open to the parties. If they wish to do  so, they can always file appropriate application before the High Court; and (viii) This order shall not be construed to mean that any final adjudication has been made on the rights of the parties. /div> Case name: Vasudha Sethi vs Kiran V.

The Karnataka High Court has said that Mohammedan Law does not recognise adoption and thus an agreement entered into between a Hindu couple to give their unborn child in adoption to a Muslim couple is not allowed.  A division bench of Justice B Veerappa and Justice K. S. Hemalekha dismissed a petition filed by the couples challenging the judgment of Additional Senior Civil Judge dismissing the petition filed under Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, by them.  The bench said, "A careful perusal of the agreement entered into between the parties clearly depicts that appellant Nos.1 and 2 belong to Muslim community and appellant Nos.3 and 4 belong to Hindu community and thereby, the Mohammedan Law does not recognise adoption."  Case Details:  Appellant Nos.1 and 2 filed the petition before the trial Court under the provisions of Sections 7 to 10 and 25 of the G & W Act to grant permission to appoint them as the adoptive parents and guardians of a minor child.  Appellants Nos.3 and 4 are the biological parents of the said child. The child was born on 26-3-2020. Since appellant Nos.1 and 2 were childless and appellant Nos.3 and 4 were unable to look after the child due to poverty, appellant Nos.1 and 2 adopted the child. After adoption of the child, appellant Nos.1 and 2 looked after and raised the child for two years as their own daughter.  The respondent State through District Child Protection Unit lodged a complaint against appellant Nos.3 and 4 stating that they have illegally sold the child to appellant Nos.1 and 2. However, the only mistake committed by appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, and appellant Nos.1 and 2, adoptive parents, is that due to lack of proper legal knowledge and guidance, the procedure was not complied with. Now, the child is in the custody of the respondents/ appellants 3 & 4. Therefore, appellant Nos.1 and 2 sought to be appointed as adoptive parents of the child. Biological parents filed a memo that they have no objection for the petition filed by adoptive parents.  Findings:  The bench referred to the agreement entered between the couples and said, As on the date of the agreement, the child was in the womb of appellant No.4 and the child was born on 26-3-2020, i.e. after five days of the agreement entered into between the parties. Thereby, both parties entered into agreement in respect of an "unborn child, which is unknown to law".  Further the bench noted that condition No.3 in the agreement is that the second party will not claim any money from the first party. Thereby, this clearly depicts that the child was given in adoption for money. It is also relevant to point out at this stage that on the basis of the complaint lodged by the 3rd respondent, Kota Police registered a case against the appellants and two others, namely Balakrishna and Reshma, under Sections 80, 81 and 87 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Later, it was transferred to Karkala Town Police Station, which filed a charge-sheet on 14-6-2022 before the Principal Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class, Karkala.  Expressing shock that an agreement was entered between the parties in respect of an "unborn child", the bench observed,  "It is well settled that 'an unborn child has a life of its own and rights of its own and the rights of the unborn are recognised by law. No doubt, only if the unborn can be treated as a person, the right to life of the unborn can be equated with the fundamental right of the mother guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution."   It added, "If the unborn has life, though it is not a natural person, it can certainly be considered as a person within the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution, for there is absolutely no reason to treat an unborn child differently from a born child. In other words, the right to life of an unborn shall also be considered as one falling within the scope of Article 21 of the Constitution of India'."  Following which it held,  "As on the date of agreement, i.e. on 21-3-2020, appellant No.4 was nine months pregnant and she delivered the child on 26-3-2020, i.e. after five days of the agreement, thereby the child has a every right to lead life with dignity and honour as contemplated under Article 21 of the Constitution of India."   The bench held,  "As on the date of agreement entered into between the parties, appellant No.4 was in verge of completing nine months of her pregnancy and thereby, the appellants, both adoptive parents and biological parents, have violated the rights of the child guaranteed under the provisions of Article 21 of the Constitution of India."   Upholding the order of the trial court the bench opined, "If really appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, came forward to give the child for adoption due to poverty, they could have surrendered the child to the concerned authority for the welfare of the child. Even if that was not possible, they could have taken care by sending the child to Government Educational institutions and now, the Government has introduced various schemes for their day-to-day essential commodities, thereby the contention of the learned counsel for appellants that appellant Nos.3 and 4 entered into agreement for adoption of their child to appellant Nos.1 and 2 due to poverty cannot be accepted."  It added "The Government has introduced many schemes to overcome, or to streamline, poverty. If they have self-confidence and respect, they can lead a family by taking a loan from Banks and instead of that, appellant Nos.3 and 4 have sold the child in the name of adoption, which cannot be tolerated."  Reference was also made to Section 35 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which provides for voluntary surrender of the child by the parents or guardian.  The court dismissed the appeal and said "Appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, to approach the Child Welfare Committee, if they really  want their child back and it is for the Child Welfare Committee to take appropriate steps and pass orders in accordance with law."  Further, "If the Child Welfare Committee comes to the conclusion that after considering all the pros and cons in handing over the child to appellant Nos.3 and 4, biological parents, then the jurisdictional Police is directed to monitor appellant Nos.3 and 4 and so that the child is not sold to anyone and ensure that A3 and A4 shall take care of the paramount interest of the child."

The Gauhati High Court on Monday set aside an order passed by a Foreigners' Tribunal declaring a resident of Jorgah village, Sonitpur as a foreigner after noting that the concerned Tribunal had earlier declared him to be an Indian citizen but had subsequently passed an ex-parte order declaring him to be a foreigner. A Bench comprising Justices Kotiswar Singh and Malashri Nandi... The Gauhati High Court on Monday set aside an order passed by a Foreigners' Tribunal declaring a resident of Jorgah village, Sonitpur as a foreigner after noting that the concerned Tribunal had earlier declared him to be an Indian citizen but had subsequently passed an ex-parte order declaring him to be a foreigner.   A Bench comprising Justices Kotiswar Singh and Malashri Nandi set aside the impugned ex-parte order and remanded the matter back to the concerned Foreigners' Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal was directed to first determine as to whether the petitioner is the same person who had earlier been declared as an Indian Citizen and thus observed, "Accordingly, this shall be the preliminary issue which is to be decided by the Foreigners Tribunal 1st Tezpur, in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 as to whether the present proceedee is the same person who was earlier declared an Indian Citizen in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 by the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur and if it is found that the petitioner is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 by the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur, the present proceeding shall immediately be concluded in favour of the petitioner on the basis of the order passed in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 on 31.08.2017 where the petitioner was declared an Indian citizen. If, however, the decision is otherwise, the petitioner will be at liberty to challenge this opinion as well as the other findings by approaching this Court again" Background In the instant case, one Md. Maynul @ Moinul Hoque had moved the instant plea against the impugned order of the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1, Assam dated December 31, 2020 declaring him to be a foreigner of post-1971 stream.  The Court was apprised by the counsel appearing for the petitioner that the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur 1st, Sonitpur vide order dated August 31, 2017 had held that the petitioner had been able to discharge his onus to prove that he is not a foreigner but an Indian. Accordingly, the reference was answered in negative against the State and in favour of the petitioner. However, the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur No.1, Assam in the subsequent proceeding i.e. in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 vide order dated December 31, 2020, had taken a view that the petitioner had neither submitted his representation nor adduced his evidence in support of his claim that he is an Indian Citizen and accordingly had failed to prove that he is an Indian citizen.  The Court was further apprised that although the petitioner had appeared before the Tribunal after receiving the notice, the reason for the petitioner's inability to appear before the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1 on several occasions was because of ongoing COVID pandemic. Accordingly, it was prayed that the impugned order dated December 31, 2020 be set aside by remanding the matter to the Foreigners Tribunal especially in light of the earlier opinion preferred by the same Tribunal vide order dated August 31, 2017.  It was further contended that since there is a similarity in the names and particulars of the proceedee/petitioner in both the proceedings, the second proceeding in respect of F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 dated December 31, 20220 before the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1st), Assam is not sustainable in view of the Supreme Court decision in Abdul Kuddus v. Union of India as the principle of res judicata will be applicable for the subsequent proceeding.  Observations  Taking cognisance of the grievance raised, the Court observed that the Supreme Court in Abdul Kuddus v. Union of India had held that if there had been an order by the Foreigners Tribunal in favour of a person determining the citizenship, the said decision will be binding on subsequent proceedings against the same person and there cannot be another proceeding to re-determine the citizenship of the person, by applying the principle of res judicata.  "In the present case, since this aspect could not be considered by the Foreigners Tribunal as it was decided ex parte, we are also of the view that the matter requires to be decided afresh by the Tribunal keeping in mind the earlier opinion dated 31.08.2017 in the light of the decision in Abdul Kuddus (supra)", the Bench observed further.  The Court further clarified that only when the Tribunal comes to a finding that the present proceedee is not the same person who was proceeded and was found to be an Indian in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012, the impugned order will be revived and the order of the Tribunal can be challenged by the petitioner both on the issue of the identity of the petitioner and other grounds raised in this petition.  Accordingly, the Court directed,  "We remand the matter to the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur, Assam by setting aside the impugned order 31.12.2020 passed by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur No.1, Assam, in F.T.(D) Case No.3512/2012 to examine whether the petitioner is the same person who was proceded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012by the Foreigners Tribunal, Tezpur 1st, Sonitpur. The Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur No.1, Sonitpur shall decide first as to whether the petitioner is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 or not, for which the petitioner shall appear before the Foreigners Tribunal on 14.02.2022 to enable the Tribunal to examine that he is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012."  The Court further averred that if it is found that the petitioner is the same person who was proceeded in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 by the Foreigners Tribunal Tezpur (1st), Sonitpur, the present proceeding shall immediately be concluded in favour of the petitioner on the basis of the order passed in F.T.(D) Case No.8312/2012 on August 31, 2017 wherein the petitioner had been declared as an Indian citizen. However, the Court ordered that since the nationality of the petitioner is already under dispute, he will remain on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 5,000/- with one local surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Police (Border), Sonitpur during the pendency of the proceeding before the Tribunal.  "The concerned Superintendent of Police (Border) shall also take steps for capturing the fingerprints and biometrics of the iris of the petitioner. The petitioner also shall not leave the jurisdiction of Sonitpur district without furnishing the details of the place of destination and necessary information including contact number to the Superintendent of Police (Border), Sonitpur", it was directed further. Case Title: Md. Maynul v. Union of India     
In a relief to the land owners who are yet to get compensation for their lands acquired 40 years ago, the Supreme Court directed the authorities to pay compensation within two months. In this case, the land was acquired for the purpose of extension of the Nehru Zoological Park in 1981. Despite taking possession, award was not passed and no amount of compensation was paid which made the land owners approach the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in 1996. The High Court directed the authority to pass an award within a period of three months. Following this, an award was passed in 1997 and a meagre compensation @ Rs. 6 per sq. yard was awarded to the land owners. Later, the Reference Court enhanced the compensation to Rs. 250 per sq. yard with solatium and interest. Thereafter, in the year 2017, appeal filed by the Revenue Department was allowed by High Court reducing the compensation to Rs. 100 /- ­per sq. yard. In appeal filed by the land owners, the Apex Court bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and JK Maheshwari noted that the land acquired is near to the Agricultural University, National Police Academy and High Court of Andhra Pradesh. Disagreing with the High Court approach, the bench said: "Taking note of the date of acquisition i.e. 1981 which is about 40 years ago, the value of the said land cannot be computed at the rate less than Rs. 250/­ per sq. yard which is supported by the evidence brought on record by the land owners." The bench added that the High Court committed an error in computing the compensation @ Rs. 100 per sq. yard ignoring the unrebutted documents produced by the land owners and without any cogent material on record, by applying reverse calculation. "The evidence as produced by the land owners has not been rebutted by filing any document. On the contrary, the departmental witness has admitted before the Reference Court that the acquired land of the village is a prominent area within the vicinity of the city of Hyderabad.", the bench noted. Regarding the contention raised by the Revenue Department on the point of deduction of development charge and the area of the land used for development, the court observed: "The land acquired is now in the heart of city of Hyderabad where the cost of the land has been increased more than 100 times. The development of the city has already taken place. The land owners, whose land has been utilized 40 years back, now cannot be compelled to pay the development charge for the development which has already taken place, only for a parcel of land to which they have not given compensation up to decades. Therefore, the plea taken by the Revenue Department sans merit"  Case details Revenue Divisional Officer vs Ismail Bhai |  (SC) 984 | CA 8727­-28 OF 2022 | 22 Nov 2022 | Justices S.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday transferred the trial of murder of former AP Minister YS Vivekananda Reddy from Andhra Pradesh to Special CBI Court Hyderabad, noting that apprehensions raised by his wife and daughter regarding derailment of fair trial are reasonable. A bench comprising Justice MR Shah and Justice MM Sundresh ordered the transfer on a petition filed by the daughter of Vivekananda Reddy, Suneetha Narreddy, who happens to be the cousin of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy. The widow of Vivekananda Reddy, who was brutally stabbed to death at his residence in Pulivendula, Kadapa district in March 2019, was a co-petitioner. The bench pronounced the operative portion of the order as follows : "Considering the facts and circumstances, it cannot be said that the apprehension on the part of the petitioners, being daughter and wife of the deceased, that there may not be fair trial and there may not be independent and fair investigation with respect to further investigation on larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence at the scene of the crime, is imaginary and/or has no substance at all. The petitioner being daughter and wife of the deceased have a fundamental right to get just as victim and they have legitimate expectation that the criminal trial is conducted in a fair manner… Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that this is a case to transfer the trial and other investigation on larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence, by a State other than the State of Andhra Pradesh. As the settled position of law, Justice is not only to be done, but also seen to have been done…Free and fair trial is sine qua non of Article 21…If the trial is not free and fair then the judicial system would be at stake affecting the confidence of the public in the system. At the same time looking into the large number of witnesses to be examined during the trial and no hardship is caused to those witnesses, we are of the opinion that the trial be transferred to CBI Special Court Hyderabad. All relevant papers, chargesheet and supplementary chargesheet to be transferred to CBI Court Hyderabad. CBI is directed to complete the further investigation on the larger conspiracy and destruction of evidence…at the earliest. It must be done independently and in an unbiased manner.  WP allowed".

The Trial Court dismissed the petition holding that no case... The marriage between the parties is emotionally dead and there is no point in persuading them to live together any more, the Supreme Court remarked while it dissolved a marriage invoking its powers Article 142 of the Constitution. In this case, the husband had filed divorce petition on the ground of cruelty and desertion by wife. The Trial Court dismissed the petition holding that no case of cruelty is made out. The High Court also upheld the dismissal. Before the Apex Court, the husband submitted that they have been living separately for more than 16 years and for all practical purposes the marriage is dead.  He referred to two judgments viz. Sukhendu Das v. Rita Mukherjee and Munish Kakkar v. Nidhi Kakkar  to submit that the court has, in the past, invoked Article 142 powers to dissolve marriages when they are totally unworkable and irretrievable. The bench, referring to these judgments noted thus: "In Sukhendu Das v. Rita Mukherjee (supra), by holding that there was an irretrievable breakdown of marriage, this Court dissolved the marriage between the parties therein by observing that they had been living separately for more than 17 years and no useful purpose would be served by compelling them to live together in matrimony.. To do complete justice between the parties, this Court in Munish Kakkar v. Nidhi Kakkar (supra) put an end to the bitter matrimonial dispute which lingered on for two decades between the parties therein." In this case, the court noted that the wife has insisted that she is not willing for dissolution of the marriage. "The marriage between the parties is emotionally dead and there is no point in persuading them to live together any more. Therefore, this is a fit case for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India", the bench observed. The bench then declared that the marriage between the parties is dissolved.    Case name: Subhransu Sarkar Vs Indrani Sarkar (Nee Das) Case no.: CA 5696 of 2021 Coram: Justice L.

The Supreme Court of India has held that when the State Government formulates rules in pursuance of its power under Section 96 of the Motor Vehicles Act, it may also bear in mind the Guidelines which have been framed by the Union Government in 2020 (Motor Vehicle Aggregators Guidelines, 2020). The observation by the court came in the order passed by Apex Court in Rapido's plea against the Maharashtra government's refusal to grant two-wheeler bike taxi aggregator license to the company. The order was passed by a bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha, and Justice JB Pardiwala. Through the order, the court had declined to entertain Rapido's plea and asked to pursue alternative remedy before the Bombay High Court. Through its order, the court held that the State of Maharashtra may keep in mind Centre's guidelines while making rules on aggregator license. For context, Chapter V of the Indian Motor Vehicles Act provides for provisions to control transports. Section 93(1) of the Act deals with the issuance of licenses to aggregators. The first proviso to this section stipulates that while issuing a license, the State Government may follow guidelines issued by the Central Government. Thus, the court in its order stated– "When the State Government formulates rules in pursuance of its power under Section 96, it may also bear in mind the Guidelines which have been framed by the Union Government in 2020." However, highlighting that the ultimate decision would be of the State government, the court added– "The Guidelines issued by the Central Government in 2020 are only of persuasive value and are not mandatory. The ultimate decision on granting a license and formulating rules lies with the State Government, who may consider the Guidelines while making their decision."

The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a PIL challenging the constitutionality of Section 33(7) of the Representation of Peoples Act 1951, which allows a candidate to contest from two seats in elections. Observing that it is a matter of legislative policy, the bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha and Justice JB Pardiwala dismissed the PIL filed by Ashwini Upadhyay. The provision was challenged as unreasonable and arbitrary for creating extra burden on the public exchequer as bye-elections will invariably follow because candidates have to give up one seat in case they win from both the seats.  "Permitting a candidate for contesting for more than one seat is a matter of legislative policy since ultimately it is the Parliament's will on whether the political democracy is furthered by granting such choice", the bench observed in the order. "Candidates may contest from different seats due to variety of reasons. Whether this would further the course of democracy is up to the Parliament", the bench stated further.  Senior Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the petitioner, placed reliance on the recommendations made by the Law Commission of India for doing away with the provision. In this regard, the bench observed that it is the prerogative of the Parliament to act upon the recommendations of the Law Commission. A statutory provision cannot be struck down as unconstitutional on the basis of the recommendation of the Law Commission.  Sankaranarayanan pointed out that before 1966, a candidate could contest from any number of seats. However, the law was amended in 1966 restricting this number of two. The bench observed that the Parliament may at a later time think it fit to further restrict the number and it can always amend the Act. However, a judicial interference is unwarranted. The petitioner sought an alternative relief that candidates who seek to contest from two seats must be asked to deposit a higher sum on money. This prayer also the bench did not entertain terming it as a policy matter.  During the hearing, CJI Chandrachud orally observed that these are matters of political democracy and not for judicial interference. "What is wrong with this?", CJI asked the petitioner. "There is another way to look at it. A leader can say that i want to establish my pan India and show that I can stand from West, east, north, south. These are all political decisions and ultimately the electorate will decide", CJI orally said. "There is no immorality in that. There are historical figures who had that kind of popularity", Justice Narasimha added.

Mr. Balaji Srinivasan, AOR Representation of Peoples Act 1951- Section 33(7) - Challenge to provision allowing candidates to contest from two seats rejected- Permitting a candidate to contest from more than one seat in a Parliamentary election or at an election to the State Legislative Assembly is a matter of legislative policy. It is a matter pertaining to legislative policy since, ultimately, Parliament determines whether political democracy in the country is furthered by granting a choice such as is made available by Section 33(7) of the Act of 1951. A candidate who contests from more than one seat may do so for a variety of reasons not just bearing on the uncertainty which the candidate perceives of an election result. There are other considerations which weigh in the balance in determining whether this would restrict the course of electoral democracy in the country. This is a matter where Parliament is legitimately entitled to make legislative choices and enact or amend legislation. The Law Commission and the Election Commission may at the material time have expressed certain viewpoints. Whether they should be converted into a mandate of the law depends on the exercise of Parliamentary sovereignty in enacting legislation. Absent any manifest arbitrariness of the provision so as to implicate the provisions of Article 14 or a violation of Article 19, it would not be possible for this Court to strike down the provision as unconstitutional- Para 12

Emphasizing that it is the duty and responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife with all dignity, the Allahabad High Court recently observed that nowadays, it is extremely difficult to conceive that a woman would be in a position to maintain her with the amount of Rs. 1500/- per month. The Bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh further remarked that the amount of ₹1500 as interim maintenance is not only a meager amount but also insufficient for the wife to maintain herself. The facts in brief  The marriage of the petitioner (the husband) was solemnized in the year February 2014 with respondent no. 2 (the wife), but the husband left her to her parental house in June 2015 due to a marital dispute between them.  Thereafter, she moved an application under section 125 Cr.P.C. in February 2016 claiming maintenance of Rs.40,000/- per month from the petitioner making an allegation of harassment and torture against him.  However, the Family Court, in March 2019, directed the petitioner to pay an amount of Rs.1500/- per month as interim maintenance to the wife from the date of order.  On non-payment of the interim maintenance, the wife initiated an execution proceeding against the petitioner by moving an application in July 2021, in which show-cause notice had been issued to the petitioner by the Family Court.  Challenging the show cause notice and the interim maintenance order of 2019, the husband moved to the Court. Initially, the petitioner/husband argued that the Family Court had committed a legal error in granting interim maintenance of Rs. 1500/- per month, however, later on, he gave up his challenge against the maintenance order and only prayed for some reasonable time, so that he may deposit the entire arrears of maintenance amount in installments. Court's order Though the petitioner did not press a challenge to the interim maintenance order on merit, however, the Court opined thus: "...the amount of interim maintenance awarded is not only meager one, but also insufficient for respondent no. 2. It is the duty and responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife with all dignity. Nowadays it is extremely difficult to conceive that a woman would be in a position to maintain her with the amount of Rs. 1500/- per month. The inherent and fundamental principle behind Section 125 Cr.P.C. is far amelioration of the financial state of affairs as well as mental agony and anguish that women suffer when she is compelled to leave her matrimonial home." Further, in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Rajnesh versus Neha and another, (2021) 2 SCC 324, the Court held that the interim maintenance had been rightly granted to respondent no. 2, and therefore, the Court opined that no interference was required in the interim maintenance order. Lastly, the Court granted three months' time to the petitioner to pay the entire amount of arrears of interim maintenance in three equal installments. First, second and third installments shall be paid on or before 12.02.2022, 12.03.2022 and 12.04.2022.  "Further, the current amount of interim maintenance from the month of January, 2022 to onwards shall be paid by the petitioner as per order dated 27.03.2019," the Court added.

The Supreme Court has held that a minority Union of workers, who were not party to the settlement entered between the majority Union and the employer, is not bound by the same and is free to raise an industrial dispute claiming to be workmen directly under the principal employer.

The Supreme Court has held that a minority Union of workers, who were not party to the settlement entered between the majority Union and the employer, is not bound by the same and is free to raise an industrial dispute claiming to be workmen directly under the principal employer. A Bench comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose refused to interfere with the order of the Bombay High Court, which largely upheld the decision of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal, Mumbai, that the demands of the workers' Union to have uniform policies for all workmen irrespective of contracts in ONGC was justified.  "In the instant case we do not find the settlement of 19th September, 2016 to be one which would be binding on the minority Union. That was a settlement essentially between the contractors and workmen engaged by the former. The appellants were only consenting parties to the settlement", the Court said after taking note of Section 18 of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947.  The bench followed the precedents Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. vs. Their Workmen [(1981) 4 SCC 627] which had observed :  "It is further unquestionable that a minority union of workers may raise an industrial dispute even if another union which consists of the majority of them enters into a settlement with the employer"  Factual Background   The Oil Field Employees Association ("Union"), a Union registered in 2014, issued a direct action notice on 26.08.2016 to the appellants, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited ("ONGC"). The Union represented workmen engaged by contractors of ONGC. On 19.09.2016, the said Union and ONGC were called by a Conciliation Officer ("Officer") to resolve the dispute arising out of the said direct action notice. It is pertinent to note that on the same day a settlement was reached between another Union, which represents 77% of the workmen and the contractor ("majority Union"), wherein ONGC was a consenting party. On 26.09.2016, a Charter of Demands with the demand that wages and service conditions of workmen of the contractors should be at par with the employees of ONGC was submitted by the Union. In turn, ONGC proposed a Fair Wage Policy. Eventually, the Conciliation failed and accordingly a report was sent to the Central Government, which referred the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal under Section 10(2A)(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 ("1947 Act"). The validity of the reference order was challenged by ONGC before the Bombay High Court, which the High Court rejected. In the meanwhile two other Unions were impleaded by the Tribunal. On appeal, the High Court sustained the award, modified the implementation part of the award.   Contention raised by the appellants   Senior Advocate, Mr. J.P. Cama appearing on behalf of ONGC referred to the definition of 'workman' in Section 2(s) of the 1947 Act to argue that the reference was not maintainable as none of the workmen that the Unions represented were employed by ONGC. The settlement entered into on 19.09.2016, with the majority Union, covered all similarly situated workmen. Placing reliance on a catena of judgements, Mr. Cama contended that workmen of contractors could not be treated as workmen of the principal employer. It was asserted that there was no agreement to suggest the concerned workmen were employed with ONGC. Moreover, abolition of contract labour does not automatically lead to absorption by the principal employer.   Contention raised by the respondents   Senior Advocate, Mr. Pallav Shishodia appearing on behalf of the Unions argued that the concerned workmen were the employees of ONGC. It was urged that the settlement of 19.09.2016 was not to be treated as a settlement under Section 18(3)(d) to bind the concerned workmen as the same had not been finalised. It was submitted that the settlement pertained to workmen of contractors whereas the concerned workmen are entitled to service benefits directly from ONGC.   Analysis by the Supreme Court  The Court observed that in the facts of the present case where the Union had claimed that the workmen were employees of ONGC, the question of jurisdiction was a mixed question of fact and law. It was noted that the Union had stated that the contracts were sham and bogus. Referring to Steel Authority of India Ltd. And Ors. v. National Union Waterfront Workers And Ors. (2001) 7 SCC 1, the Court clarified that when a plea of sham contract is raised, the veil is pierced to verify the correct status of employment. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal cannot be faulted.  "...we would not like to interfere with the relief directed to be given by the High Court. The scope of jurisdiction of the Industrial Court is wide and in appropriate cases it has the jurisdiction even to make a contract. In our opinion, the directives issued by the Tribunal, as modified by the High Court are reasonable and cannot be termed as perverse."  Considering the judgments referred to by the parties, the Court opined that the settlement of 19.09.2016 being one between the contractor and their workmen, with ONGC as merely the consenting party, would not make the settlement binding between ONGC and the minority Union. A settlement arrived between contractor and workmen is of no consequence in binding the subject-dispute where ONGC has been found to be the employer. The Court was of the view that the engagement by the contractors cannot be the sole basis for determining their status as workmen of contractors.   Case Name: M/s.

The Gujarat High Court has made it clear that the Assistant Director of Information (Journalism) Class II Recruitment Rules, 2015 nowhere stipulate that Journalism experience necessarily has to be from a government organization for appointment to the post of Assistant Director of Information (Journalism) Class II. "Nowhere does Recruitment Rule stipulate that it has to be in only a government or local body or a government undertaking board or the Corporation or a Company. This would amount to restrictive reading of the Rule and, therefore, it cannot be said that the respondent No.3 does not possess the requisite experience," Justice Biren Vaishnav observed. It thus dismissed a petition filed by a journalist challenging the appointment of Respondent no. 3 to the said post. The brief facts were that the Petitioner possessed a B.Com degree and diploma in journalism. He had worked as a reporter and subsequently, as a senior reporter in certain publications. He also possessed a Master's degree in journalism. Later, he was appointed as an Information Assistant Class III in the department of Information and Broadcasting of the State in 2010. In 2015, he responded to an advertisement inviting applications for the post of Assistant Director of Information (Journalism) Class II. However, the Respondent no.3 herein was declared successful.  The Petitioner contested that Respondent no.3 did not possess requisite experience. It was argued that Respondent no. 3 had worked as sub-editor in a certain publication which was deblocked in 1962 which implied that the certificate was 'bad.' Further, it was submitted that Respondent no. 3 worked at two places simultaneously, which was improper. Per contra, Respondent No. 3 submitted that he had worked in the field of journalism for more than 14 years and had experience as a sub-editor, as well. Further, though he worked at two places simultaneously, the shifts did not clash and the time period therefore was not overlapping.  After hearing these submissions and upon perusal of the relevant Rules, the Court observed, "Reading the Rule makes it clear that an incumbent apart from holding a post-graduate diploma in Journalism, which the respondent No.3 possessed should have about 3 years' combined experience in the Editorial work. Nowhere does Recruitment Rule stipulate that it has to be in only a government or local body or a government undertaking board or the Corporation or a Company. " Hence, the petition was dismissed.

The Supreme Court has held that the power of the arbitral tribunal to award interest is subject to an agreement between the parties to the contrary. The Court held that the tribunal cannot award interest if the parties have agreed otherwise.  The Division Bench of Justice L. Nageshwar Rao and Justice B.R. Gavai held that when the parties have an agreement between themselves that governs the issue of interest, the arbitrator would lose its discretion and will be guided by the agreement between the parties.   The Court held that party-autonomy is the cornerstone of the A&C Act and the discretion available with the arbitrator would cease to have effect if the parties have exercised their autonomy under Section 31(7)(a) of the Act.  The Court further held that the power vested in the arbitrator is discretionary. The arbitrator can allow interest on any part of the claim. It further held that the tribunal can award interest for any period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made or it may not award any interest at all. It further held that the arbitrator is well within its power to award any rate of interest as it deems reasonable.   The Court also held that ordinarily the total amount of sum awarded on which the future interest is to be given would include the principal amount and the amount awarded as interest pendente lite. The Court has held that the word 'sum' under Section 31(7(a) of the A&C Act includes both the principal amount and the interest allowed on such claims. However, this is subject to the discretion of the arbitrator who may not include the interest component in the sum of the award for the purpose of future interest.   Facts  The parties entered into a Concession Agreement wherein the respondent was to carry out certain civil works. A dispute arose between the parties which were referred to arbitration. The arbitrator partly allowed the claims of the appellant. The award was affirmed by the Supreme Court.  The appellant filed for the execution of the award and sought future interest on the entire amount of the sum awarded by the arbitrator. The executing court rejected the contention of the appellant on the ground that the arbitrator allowed future interest only on the principal amount. Aggrieved by the order of the executing court rejecting its claim for future interest on the amount of interest awarded, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Supreme Court.  The Contention Of The Parties  The appellant challenged the order on the following grounds:  The Court erred in not allowing future interest on the entire sum of the arbitral award. It relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Hyder Consulting v. Governor, State of Orissa, (2015) 2 SCC 189 to contend that the tribunal can allow future on the sum of the award that also includes the interest allowed on the principal amount.The Court has erred in rejecting the claim of the appellant with regard to the addition of the interest pendente lite in the sum in terms of Section 31(7)(a) of the A&C Act.   The respondent countered the contentions of the appellant on the following grounds:  The power of the arbitrator to award interest is subject to the agreement between the parties to the contrary. The arbitrator cannot allow interest if the agreement forecloses interest. The parties had an agreement with regards to the award of interest, the arbitrator and the courts have rightly followed the agreement and not included pendente lite interest in the sum of the award.   Analysis By The Court  The Court reiterated that the arbitrator is empowered to allow future interest on the pendente lite interest. The Court held that the sum of the award would include both the principal amount and the interest component for the purpose of future interest. However, this power of the arbitrator is subject to an agreement between the parties.   The Court held that when the parties have an agreement between themselves that governs the issue of interest, the arbitrator would lose its discretion and will be guided by the agreement between the parties.   The Court examined the words 'unless otherwise agreed by the parties' and held whenever the parties have an agreement on the grant of interest, the arbitrator shall be bound by such an agreement.   The Court held that party-autonomy is the cornerstone of the A&C Act and the discretion available with the arbitrator would cease to have effect if the parties have exercised their autonomy under Section 31(7)(a) of the Act.   The Court held the parties have an agreement between themselves that squarely covers the issue of interest, therefore, there was no infirmity in the impugned order which rejected the claim of the petitioner to include in the sum of the award, the component of pendente lite interest.   The Court distinguished its judgment in Hyder Consulting (Supra) on the ground that the parties did not have an agreement, therefore, the court had no occasion to consider the effect of the words 'unless otherwise agreed by the parties' on the power of the arbitrator.   The Court further held that the power vested in the arbitrator is a discretionary power, therefore, the arbitrator is not bound to award interest. The arbitrator can allow interest on any component for the entire or any period thereof or it may not award any interest at all.   Accordingly, the Court dismissed the petition.

The Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court recently refused to allow petitioner to change his date of birth in the school record stating that only obvious errors can be corrected after the student has left the school. Justice Ravindra V. Ghuge and Justice Arun R. Pednekar refused to entertain a writ petition praying for change in date of birth in the school record after he had left the school. It was the case of the petitioner that his date of birth was incorrectly recorded in at the time of his admission in the 1st standard. The same birth date is mentioned in the school leaving certificate. Petitioner's father applied for correction of the school record and the application was forwarded to the Block Education Officer.  Petitioner obtained a direction from the Judicial Magistrate First Class under the Registration of Birth And Deaths Act, 1967 for entry of correct date of birth of the petitioner in the concerned register. The petitioner approached the High Court seeking a direction to the concerned authorities to correct his birth date in the school record. The court noted that the issue of change of birth date in school record has been considered by the Full Bench judgement in Janabai v. State of Maharashtra. The referred to Clause 26.3 and Clause 26.4 of the Secondary School code. From a joint reading of both the clauses the court concluded that no application for alteration in the date of birth is allowed after student has left secondary school except to correct obvious mistakes. Obvious mistakes included cases where the date recorded does not exist in the calendar, and similar errors.  The court applied the Full Bench judgement in Janabai to the current case and held that the petitioner's application is not in the nature of obvious mistake and cannot be accepted. Thus, the present writ petition cannot be entertained Case no. – Writ Petition No. 8620 of 2022 Case title – Govind Ramrao Solanke v. State of Maharashtra and Ors.

The Delhi High Court has recently imposed Rs. 10,000 cost on a party for appearing in vest during the virtual hearing, observing that such a conduct was totally unacceptable.  "During the course of VC petitioner no. 5 has appeared through VC for his identification by the IO in his vest. The conduct of the petitioner no.5 in appearing before the Court in his vest is totally unacceptable. Even though the proceedings were being conducted through VC he should have appeared before the Court in proper clothes," Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar ordered  The Court added that the cost imposed shall be deposited with the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within a week by the party.  The Court was dealing with petition seeking quashing of FIR registered concerning a matrimonial dispute registered under Sections 498A, 323, 341, /506 and 34 of the IPC.  The petitioner no 1 (husband) and respondent no 2 (wife) got married on 6.12.2014 according to Hindu rites and ceremonies. After differences arose between them, they started living separately since 15.10.2019 and the FIR was registered thereafter.  During the course of hearing, the Court was apprised by the petitioners that during the pendency of the trial, the parties had settled the matter amicably and that the petition under Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act was allowed and the marriage was dissolved by way of a decree passed by the family court.  The petitioners also submitted that the visitation rights of the girl child which were not given to the petitioner-husband and thus requested that the wife may be directed to send an e-mail every month informing him about the well-being of the girl child. On this, the wife informed the Court that she had no objection to the same and would be sending e-mail to the husband every month keeping him informed about the well being of the girl child. "Keeping in view the above facts and circumstances, since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties, no useful purpose will be served by keeping the case pending. It will be nothing but abuse of the process of law. Consequentially, this petition is allowed and FIR No.0286/2019, under Section 498A/323/341/506/34 IPC, registered at Police Station Safdarjung Enclave, Delhi, and the proceedings emanating therefrom shall stand quashed," the Court said while quashing the FIR.

The Supreme Court on Saturday (13th November) held that two persons cannot be appointed on one sanctioned post as the same would impose a serious financial burden on the State.  A bench comprising Justices M.R. Shah and A.S. Bopanna dismissed a petition filed by the appellants, three Stenographers in the judgeship of Moradabad, whose appointments had been initially quashed by the Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court and later affirmed by the Division Bench. Factual Background  The matter goes as far back as 1987 when in the judgeship of Moradabad a competitive examination was conducted for the post of English and Hindi Stenographers. The appellants participated for the post of English Stenographers and got selected for the same as per the list prepared on 14.07.1987.  However, there were no vacancies for the English Stenographers and the refore, no appointments ensued. As per Rule 14(3) of the Subordinate Civil Courts Ministerial Establishment Rules, 1947 ("Rules"), which requires the list to remain valid for one year, the concerned list came to an end on 13.07.1988. In the meanwhile, there were some leave vacancies in the post of Hindi Stenographers and the appellants were temporarily appointed to fill up these vacancies for a period from 14.10.1987 to 15.11.1987 with a specific condition that they would be terminated once the regular employees resume their duties.  Eventually, fresh examinations for the post of Hindi Stenographers were conducted and fresh appointments were made. Therefore, it was time for the appellants, who were appointed in leave vacancy posts to be terminated. A representation was made by the appellants to the District Judge, Moradabad, who then forwarded his comments to the Deputy Registrar, High Court. Vide order dated 22.05.1990, the District Judge was directed that a list of ex-stenos, who were approved on 14.07.1987 be prepared and their names be arranged in the order of merit. In the meanwhile, a typing/speed test was conducted for the post of Hindu Stenographers, but the appellants could not qualify as per Rule 5(c).  On 05.06.1990, without any further intimation of the result of the speed test to the Deputy Registrar, High Court, the District Judge, Moradabad terminated the service of the new appointees (Respondent No. 1 to 3 herein) and appointed the appellants instead, which was subsequently were challenged before the Single Judge, who therein quashed and set aside the appointment of the appellants.  Contentions raised by the appellants The appellants argued that their appointments were approved by the Allahabad High Court vide order dated 22.05.1990 and accordingly, appointment letters were issued by the District Judge, Moradabad. They also averred that the one year rule under Rule 14(3) does not apply to the recruitment list on merit under Rule 11, but only to the reserved category candidates under Rule 12. Referring to the judgment of the High Court, the appellants submitted that it had erred in not considering that the appellants had continuously worked for the judgeship of Moradabad for more than 30 years. Contending that the appointment of Respondents No. 1 to 3 had become age barred, the appellants argued that the said appointments were made by the interim order of the High Court, almost 24 years after the actual selection list was prepared on 29.11.1988.  Contentions raised by the Allahabad High Court The appellants were never appointed to the post of Hindi Stenographers after following due selection procedure. The Respondent No. 1 to 3 were rightfully appointed on the substantive sanctioned posts. Since the appellants' appointment was temporary in nature, once selected the Respondent No.1 to 3 were to take up the posts.  The Respondent No. 1 to 3 adopted the submissions made by the Allahabad High Court.  Findings of the Supreme Court The Supreme Court noted that the applicants had never applied for the post of Hindi Stenographers. The initial application of the appellants were only for the post of English Stenographer. On perusal of the appointment letters of the appellants, the Court observed that the appellants were appointed temporarily against leave vacancies in the post of Hindi Stenographers, and were to be terminated once the regular employees resumed duties. The Court pointed out that instead of being terminated, the appellants had remained in service and had indeed unjustly benefitted.  The Supreme Court accepted the three grounds enunciated by the High Court for quashing and setting aside appointment of the appellants:  In the year 1990 no appointments could have been made based on the selection list of 14.07.1987 as the same had expired on 13.07.1988;The appellants did not pass the speed test for Hindi Stenographers;Unlike the Respondents No. 1 to 3, the appellants were never appointed to the post of Hindi Stenographers following due selection process.     The Supreme Court pointed out that the submission made by the appellants that the appointment of the Respondent No. 1 to 3 was effective in 2012 by the interim order of the Division Bench was incorrect as in 1988 itself the said respondents were appointed after following the selection procedure. However, they were unjustly terminated in 1990 when the appellants were appointed.   The submission of the appellant that they had worked for almost 30 years was not acceptable to the Apex Court, given the fact that they had illegally continued service pursuant to the interim order of the High Court, which accommodated Respondent No. 1 to 3 in the same post. The Supreme Court further noted that post 2012 both the appellants and the Respondent No. 1 to 3 were working on the post of Hindi Stenographers, which is impermissible. The Court observed -  "There cannot be appointment of two persons on one sanctioned post. Otherwise there will be a financial burden on the State of two persons on one sanctioned post. Under the circumstances the prayer of the appellants to continue them in services and to pay them pensionary benefits etc. also cannot be granted. Appellants are not entitled to any relief."

The Madras High Court has observed that the pendency of a criminal case that is at the FIR stage is not a bar for the issuance of a passport. However, in cases where the final report has been filed, permission of the concerned Court has to be obtained for issuance of a Passport, it further said.  Justice GR Swaminathan further observed that such a requirement is applicable only when the concerned person wants to leave India and not when the person wants to come back to India.  In the present case, the Petitioner, carrying on a business in Malaysia, lost his passport and he filed a complaint before the local police in Malaysia. He then approached the Indian Embassy in Malaysia for the re-issuance of his Passport. However, the Indian Embassy declined to do so citing involvement of petitioner in criminal cases.  The petitioner was involved in a few criminal cases while he was in India in the years 2017 and 2018. While one case is pending in the FIR stage, the other two are in CC Stage.  Observing that earlier under similar circumstances the court had taken a favorable view, Justice Swaminathan allowed the issuance of a passport to the petitioner. The petitioner was directed to make an application to the Indian Embassy in Malaysia enclosing a copy of the order. The embassy was directed to renew/re-issue the passport of the petitioner for a period of two years.  The Court also directed the petitioner to come over to India and participate in the criminal proceedings. The petitioner was also directed to inform the concerned Court about the orders passed in the present case. It was further observed that if the criminal case does not come to an end within the period for which the Passport was renewed, the petitioner could approach the concerned Court where the criminal case was going on and get necessary permissions in this regard.

The Madras High Court recently observed that the relevant date while considering the pensionary benefits of Teachers would be the date on which the teacher entered into service and not the date on which the appointment was actually confirmed.  Justice S. Vaidyanathan and Justice N Mala relied on the decision in V.Vasanthi v. State of Tamil Nadu wherein, on similar facts, the court had held that the service period of teachers commences from the date of appointment and not from the date of approval, even though the monetary benefits start to accrue only from the date of completion of the training. Thus, the service rendered before the completion of training was also to be considered for pension. In light of the order in Vasanthi's case, the court observed as under: We are therefore of the view that the issue raised in this writ appeal is covered by the Judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in V.Vasanthi's case. The contention of the respondent that the relevant date would be the date of approval of appointment cannot be countenanced and hence, the same stands rejected.  Background The Government of Tamil Nadu passed G.O.Ms.No.559 School Education Department dated 11.07.1995 prohibiting the appointment of graduate teachers in secondary grade vacancy. Some schools appointed the respondents in violation of this GO. These appointments were not confirmed by the appellants. The teachers who were affected approached the High Court where the High Court confirmed the validity of the G.O and also directed to approve the appointments made from 11.07.1995 to 19.05.1998.  Pursuant to the order, the Government issued G.O Ms.No. 155 dated 03.10.2002 giving permission for approval for B.T teachers who were appointed as Secondary Grade teachers during the period from 11.07.1995 to 19.05.1998, subject to their undergoing one month Child Psychology Training. These teachers were granted approval of appointment after they completed their one month training.  While so, the President of Tamil Nadu recognised aided School Managers Association made a representation requesting for extending the benefit of G.O.Ms. 155 dated 03.10.2002 to the teachers appointed till the order of the High Court. The government accepted the representation and issued G.O.Ms.No. 150 extending the benefits of earlier GO to 22 teachers who were appointed subsequent to the cut off date and before the order of the High Court.  The teachers covered under the G.O Ms,. 155 challenged certain provision of the GO with respect to recovery from the teachers before the High Court and the same was allowed. A single bench directed the government to consider the past service of the teachers for the purpose of pensionary benefits. As per the judgement of the court, the Government passed G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004 introducing New Pension Scheme and the cut off date for New Pension Scheme was given as 01.04.2003 The teachers covered under the GO Ms. No. 155 filed writ petitions praying for a direction to count their past services prior to completion of Child Psychology Training for pensionary benefits. The court ordered in favour of the teachers and the Government passed G.O.Ms.Ms.413 implementing the order of the court.  Two other teachers, whose appointments were approved on completion of training in 09.11.2007 also approached court seeking benefits of old pension scheme. The court passed a common order on 22.12.2010 ordering that they would be entitled to the pension scheme applicable to teachers prior to 01.04.2003 and they would not be governed by G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004.  The main ground on which the appellants herein were denying the challenge was that their appointments were approved with effect from 09.11.2007 and therefore they would not be covered by the Old Pension Scheme, but would be covered only, under the New Pension Scheme introduced vide G.O.Ms.No.430 dated 06.08.2004.  The court was however not inclined to accept this submission. Finding no infirmity in the order of the single judge, the court confirmed the same and directed the appellant Government to extend the benefits to the respondents within four months time.

The Supreme Court observed that the conviction under Section 498-A IPC would not be sustainable when the marriage was found to be null and void. In this case, the accused were convicted for the offences punishable under Section 498-A IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. In appeal before the Apex Court, it was contended that, as the marriage between the parties has been held to be null and void by the judgment of the High Court of Madras, the conviction under Section 498-A IPC would not be sustainable. Reliance was placed on the decision in Shivcharan Lal Verma v. State of Madhya Pradesh  (2007) 15 SCC 369. "Undisputedly, the marriage between the appellant No.1 and PW-1 has been found to be null and void. As such the conviction under Section 498-A IPC would not be sustainable in view of the judgment of this Court in the case Shivcharan Lal Verma's case supra.", the bench of Justices B R Gavai and Vikram Nath observed. Regarding the conviction under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, the court noted that the trial Judge by an elaborate reasoning, arrived at after appreciation of evidence, has found that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.  "In an appeal/revision, the High court could have set aside the order of acquittal only if the findings as recorded by the trial Court were perverse or impossible.We do not notice any perversity in the approach adopted by the learned trial Judge. The view taken by the trial Court also cannot said to be impossible.", the bench said. Therefore, allowing the appeal, the bench acquitted the appellants.

The Gujarat High Court has held that once the Bank agrees to sell a property mortgaged with it by a loan defaulter and a third party pays full consideration for purchase of said property after entering into a valid agreement with the Bank, the latter cannot turn back and refuse the title deed, no objection certificate/no due certificate.Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati thus directed... The Gujarat High Court has held that once the Bank agrees to sell a property mortgaged with it by a loan defaulter and a third party pays full consideration for purchase of said property after entering into a valid agreement with the Bank, the latter cannot turn back and refuse the title deed, no objection certificate/no due certificate. Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati thus directed the Respondent, Syndicate bank, to release the charge over the property in question and hand over the original title documents of the property to the Applicant (purchaser) within two weeks.  The Bench observed that the Applicant had deposited the entire amount of Rs. 2.5 crores to the bank through Respondent No. 2 (loan defaulter) which had been accepted by the Respondent No. 1 Bank and encashed, as well.  "It is not open for the Bank to fasten indirect liability of the respondent No.2 – Vinayak Fabrics to the the respondent No.1 Bank in respect of loan advanced to M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines wherein respondent No.2 – Vinayak Fabrics is a guarantor. The respondent Bank is bound by the contractual agreement between the writ-applicant and the respondent Bank. It is not open for the Bank to assert that unless and until the total dues of the Bank which are due and payable by the alleged liability of M/s. Jay Ganesh Roadlines in favour of the respondent No.1 Bank are realized. The writ-applicant be denied the release of the title deed, no objection certificate/no due certificate with respect to the subject property," it observed. Respondent No. 2 had availed financial assistance from Respondent No. 1 Bank and while availing assistance, Respondent No. 2 had mortgaged the property in question in favour of the Bank. Failure to repay the loan led the Bank to classify the account of Respondent No. 2 as a Non-Performing Asset.  Accordingly, the Bank proceeded to sell the mortgaged property to the Applicant for INR 2.5 crores with the consent of Respondent No. 2  The Bench noted that though the Bank had received the entire amount through Respondent No.2, the Bank refused to issue a certificate for releasing the charge over the property and did not hand over the title despite several reminders by the Applicant.   The Applicant primarily contested that the Bank had given no-objection for sale of the property vide a 2017 communication. Therefore, it was not open for the Respondent Bank to refrain from releasing the property.   Per contra, the Respondent Bank contested that it was not in a position to release the charge on the property as per banking norms. It submitted that all direct/indirect liability should be closed. In the instant case, Respondent No. 2 had given guarantee in another account which was also an NPA. Therefore, that liability was outstanding.  Justice Nanavati placed reliance on the law laid down by the High Court in SCA No. 13890 of 2017:  "To put it in other words, the deposit of title deeds,by which the mortgage was created by the writ-applicants, was for a specific purpose to cover an advance for a specific loan. When such is the situation, the borrower, having deposited the title deeds in order to secure a specific transaction, the Bank cannot take a stance that they could hold the title deeds for a balance due in a different loan amount, i.e. with respect of M/s. Radheshyam Fibres Private Limited, where the writ-applicant nos.2 and 3 may be guarantors. Further, the language of Section 171 of the Contract Act is explicit to the fact that the bankers are entitled to retain as a security for a 'general balance account'."  Justice Nanavati also observed that the aforesaid judgement was confirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court. Further reference was also made to Pravin Cotton Pvt. Ltd., vs. Branch Manager, Dena Bank, 2019 SCC OnLine Guj. 4201 to reach the same conclusion.  The High Court also perused the communication by Respondent No. 1 Bank to conclude that the entire amount had been deposited in favour of the Bank which was encashed, as well. Therefore, the Bank was bound by the contractual agreement between the Applicant and the Bank.  Accordingly, it was held that no subsisted liability could be said to be continued against the Applicant.

The Karnataka High Court has held that maintenance awarded to an estranged wife under the provisions of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, cannot be enhanced on an application made by her under section 127 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).  A single judge bench of Justice M. Nagaprasanna said,  "A maintenance that is awarded under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. can be varied in an application filed under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. What is sine qua-non is that an order of maintenance should precede a petition under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C., failing which, a petition under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. seeking enhancement of maintenance is not available."  The court quashed the orders passed by the magistrate court enhancing the maintenance amount granted to the wife under Section 12 of the DV Act from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000, which was confirmed by the sessions judge.  The bench said,  "It is an undisputed fact that the respondent-wife invoked the provisions of the Act in which maintenance was awarded. It is also an admitted fact that there is no proceeding initiated by the respondent-wife invoking Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. Therefore, without there being any determination of maintenance under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C petition under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. is not maintainable."  It added,  "The language employed in Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. is unequivocal as on a proof of change in the circumstances of any person receiving allowance under Section 125 of Cr.P.C. can maintain a petition under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. A proceeding under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. therefore should precede a proceeding under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C."  Following which the court held, "The fact that provisions of Act was invoked for grant of maintenance and provisions of Cr.P.C. are invoked seeking enhancement of maintenance, cannot be countenanced in law. Therefore, the order passed by the learned Magistrate enhancing maintenance under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. was without jurisdiction and a nullity in law. The foundation being a nullity in law, a super structure to it affirming the order of the learned Magistrate, by the learned Sessions Judge will have to follow suit – is to be declared a nullity in law."  Case Background:  The couple married on 13.04.2001. Following the marital life turning sore, the wife filed an application invoking Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The magistrate court awarded a maintenance of Rs.1,000. Later the wife filed a petition invoking Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. for enhancement of the maintenance amount awarded under the Act. The petition came to be allowed and the magistrate court increased the maintenance amount to Rs.5,000, from the date of the order.  The husband challenged the order before sessions court; the court confirmed the order of the magistrate court. Following which he approached the High Court.

The Supreme Court reiterated that the purpose for which the land acquisition is made is also a relevant factor for determining the market value A large extent of land in Adrial Village of Manthani Mandal, Karimnagar District of Andhra Pradesh was acquired by the State Government for the benefit of Singareni Collieries Company Limited. Not satisfied with the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer, the land owners sought references under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The Reference Court fixed the market value at Rs.30,000/­ per acre and Rs.50,000/­ per acre. The Reference Court also awarded the compensation @ Rs.15,000/­ per acre towards sub­soil mineral rights. Later, the High Court modified this award and fixed the compensation @ Rs.80,000/­ per acre considering the market value of the land Rs.1,23,000/­ per acre and thereafter deducting 1/3rd towards the developmental activities. The High Court has also in addition awarded Rs.10,000/­ per acre as part of the market value for sub­soil rights. Aggreived with this, the original claimants/land owners preferred appea seeking enhancement of the amount of compensation. The claimants/land owners contended that the lands in question have been acquired for the benefit of the mining company/ Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. which is to be used for excavation of coal. The coal is already existed in the lands acquired. Since the entire land is to be mined and the coal is to be excavated, there is no wastage of land on account of any developmental activities such as roads, sewage lines, parks etc. In that view of the matter, there is no development required and therefore 1/3rd deduction is not warranted at all, they contended. "Identical question came to be considered by this Court in the case of Nelson Fernandes (supra) and after taking into consideration the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Basavva vs. Spl. Land Acquisition Officer, (1996) 9 SCC 640, in which this Court has held that the purpose for which acquisition is made is also a relevant factor for determining the market value", the court noted. Applying this judgment to the facts of this case, the court observed thus while partly allowing the appeal: "When the acquisition is solely for the purpose of excavation of coal and the entire land is acquired on the basis of the estimates of the coal reserve identified and the entire land is to be mined and used and no further developmental activity is required, we are of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has erred in deducting 1/3rd towards the developmental activities."

The Supreme Court observed that criminal proceedings inter-se parties in cases of offences relating to matrimonial disputes can be quashed if the Court is satisfied that the parties have genuinely settled the disputes amicably. In this case, the husband was charged under Sections 498A, 427, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code pursuant to an FIR lodged by the wife. The couple entered into a settlement agreement and a decree of divorce by mutual consent was granted to them. The parties also agreed that FIR and the proceedings arising therefrom should be quashed. However, the Karnataka High Court rejected the prayer to quash the criminal proceedings against the husband. In appeal, the Apex Court noted that the appellant is an officer in the Border Security Force and as per the job requirement, he has to serve in different parts of the country, and thus would be put to harassment. Referring to decisions in Jitendra Raghuvanshi and Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi and Another, (2013) 4 SCC 58 and B.S. Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and Another, (2003) 4 SCC 675, the court observed. "This court has held that in cases of offences relating to matrimonial disputes, if the Court is satisfied that the parties have genuinely settled the disputes amicably, then for the purpose of securing ends of justice, criminal proceedings inter-se parties can be quashed by exercising the powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India or even under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.",  The bench therefore allowed the appeal by quashing the criminal proceedings against the appellant.

The Delhi High Court has held that the accused cannot recourse to a third party, such as a Power of Attorney holder, to represent him in criminal proceedings.  Citing the mandatory requirement of personal appearance of the accused in the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court noted that the presence of third parties in criminal cases would defeat the very purpose of the criminal justice system.  Accordingly, the Court dismissed a petition under Article 227, Constitution of India read with Section 482, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, seeking quashing of proceedings through the Petitioner's Representative holding his Special Power of Attorney (S.P.A.).  Background  The Petitioner accused had been named absconder vide Order dated 5.3.2016 by the Trial Court. The Petitioner was embroiled in criminal proceedings under an F.I.R. and charge sheet under Section 82/83 of the CrPC. Challenging the Order and the proceedings, the Petitioner filed a Petition seeking to quash all criminal proceedings through his S.P.A. holder. The affidavit for the Petition was also filed by the S.P.A. holder. The Court decided on the maintainability of the Petition filed via S.P.A. holder.  Bar to appoint S.P.A. Holder  The Delhi High Court held that the Petition filed through a S.P.A. holder is not maintainable.  The Court cited the Supreme Court in Amit Ahuja v. Gian Parkash Bhambri (2010) and T.C. Mathai and another v. The District & Sessions Judge (1999).  The Supreme Court in T.C. Mathai described representation through Power of Attorney as an act of non-compliance in criminal cases when a Statute requires explicitly an accused to appear in person. Such a representation may frustrate the vires of statutes such as Chapter XVI, Sections 205 and 273, which require the personal appearance of the accused.  The Court held thus, "Section 2 of the Power of Attorney Act cannot override the specific provision of a statute which requires that a particular act should be done by a party in person." In sum, the law requires that the accused not recourse to a proxy or a third person to appear on his behalf or represent his case citing public interest in criminal proceedings.  The exception to this general rule was laid out in Amit Ahuja for minors, persons with disabilities, insane persons, or other incompetent person named as accused. Further, only a guardian or a next friend may initiate the proceedings in such circumstances. This prevents the Court from mushrooming by third parties/public interest litigants in criminal cases. Further, filing such a petition through a proxy would defeat the very purpose of the criminal justice system.  Deferring to this line of precedents, Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar held:  "In the instant case as well, the Petition has been filed through S.P.A. holder which is per se not maintainable. Therefore no permission can be granted to the Petitioner to file the present Petition bearing No. CRL.M.C. 1571/2021 under article 227 of the Constitution of India read with section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking quashing of F.I.R. No. 258/2010 and the charge-sheet and all the proceedings arising therefrom including the proceedings initiated against the Petitioner u/s 82/83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure through his S.P.A. holder."  Accordingly, the Petition was dismissed.  Case Title: Amrinder Singh & Raja Through: Spa Holder Sukhjinder Singh v. The State of NCT of Delhi  Date of Judgment: 04.01.2022  Coram: Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar         
The Karnataka High Court has said that a son being the legal representative is liable to discharge the liability of the deceased father under the Negotiable Instruments Act.  A single judge bench of Justice K Natarajan rejected the argument canvased by one respondent/accused B T Dinesh, that there is no legally enforceable debt against him as the loan was borrowed by his father, who expired before filing of the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  The bench said “As a legal representative of the father, the accused is liable to repay the loan to the complainant.” The bench in coming to this findings relied on Section 29 of the Act which pertains to the legal representative of the deceased person liable to discharge the liability.  Case Details:  As per the complaint filed by Prasad Raykar, the father of the respondent-accused - Bharamappa is said to have borrowed Rs.2,60,000, from the complainant appellant on 07.03.2003 for his business and his family necessities and agreed to pay 2% interest per month by executing the on-demand promissory note in favour of the complainant.  In the meantime, Bharamappa died leaving behind his son-accused as a legal heir i.e., prior to filing of the private complaint. On the death of Bharamappa, the complainant asked the accused for repayment of the loan amount and the accused requested for some time. But he has paid Rs.10,000 to the complainant on 10.06.2005 and the complainant asked the accused to clear the dues of his father.  Later, the accused is said to have issued two cheques for the sum of Rs.2,25,000 each dated 07.06.2006 and 07.07.2006 respectively. The cheques came to be dishonoured as the account was closed. A notice was served on the accused but he did not pay the amount. Hence, the private complaint came to be filed before the Magistrate under sections of the Negotiable instruments act.  The trial court convicted the accused. However, the appellate court reversed the order and acquitted the accused. Following which the complainant filed an appeal.  Finding:  The bench noted that as per Section 29 of the N.I. Act, the legal representative of the deceased issued a cheque and he is liable personally. Then referring to the Supreme Court judgment in the case of ICDS Ltd. vs. Beena Shabeer & Anr., it held: “As a legal representative of the father, the accused is liable to repay the loan to the complainant. Therefore, the contention raised by the respondent counsel is not acceptable. The cheque was dishonoured thereby the accused is liable for the punishment under Section 138 of N.I. Act and the complaint is maintainable.”  The Court also rejected the argument of the respondent that the debt is time barred since his father had borrowed the loan in the year 2003 and the cheque was issued after four years. It observed, “The complainant has stated and it is specifically mentioned that the accused has undertaken to repay the amount and he has paid Rs.10,000, within two years towards his father’s liability and thereafter in the year 2006, he has issued two cheques in this behalf.”  Accordingly it held, “Therefore, once the amount was already repaid, the question of taking contention that it is barred debt does not arise and it gets renewed. Therefore, the accused once paid Rs.10,000 by cash and subsequently, he issued a cheque to discharge the liability, he is liable for discharging his liability of his father.”  Following which it allowed the appeal and set aside the judgement of the appellate court and confirmed the order of the trial court convicting the accused.
