2.          This is defendant’s appeal assailing the correctness of the order dated 16.07.2019 passed by Justice Prithviraj K. Chavan, rejecting the Misc. Civil Application No.526 of 2019 in Civil Application (Review) No.7 of 2019. The order reads as under: “Heard Mr. M. Amonkar, learned Advocate for the Digitally signed by 2. In view of the clause (3) of Chapter 13 of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules prayer (a) of the application cannot be granted. 3. Mr. N. Fernandes, learned Counsel submits that matter be placed after 5th October, 2019. 4.   At his request, stand over to 07.10.2019” 3.   A bare reading of the impugned order extracted above would raise a hundred doubts in the mind as to why this petition has been filed. However trivial, we may consider the issue at hand, but considering the seriousness and the length of arguments advanced by the learned Senior Counsels, we were compelled to reserve the judgment and give a serious thought to the issue. 4.   The respondent instituted a suit on 11.01.1985 for declaration and permanent injunction registered as Regular Suit No.21 of 1985 in the court of Civil Judge, Junior Division, at Margao titled “Mrs. Aurelia Ana da Piedade Miranda Araujo Alvares and others vs. Mr. Gobindram Jethanand Ramnani and others”. After the contest, the Trial Court decreed the suit vide judgment and order dated 26.08.2003. The appellant preferred an appeal under section 96 of Code of Civil Procedure, 19081, in the court of District Judge at Margao, Goa, registered as Regular Civil Appeal No.83 of 2013, titled “Mr. Suresh G. Ramnani Vs. Mrs. Aurelia Ana da Piedade Miranda alias Araiyo Alvares and others”. This appeal initially came to be dismissed vide judgment and order dated 22.04.2008. The second appeal under section 100 CPC was preferred by the appellant which came to be allowed vide judgment and order dated 02.03.2012. The High Court remanded the matter to the First Appellate Court for a fresh decision. After remand the first appeal was again dismissed vide judgment and order dated 09.07.2012. 5.       Aggrieved by the same, Second Appeal No.98 of 2013 was preferred by the appellant in the High Court of Bombay at Panaji, Goa, titled “Mr. Suresh G. Ramnani vs. Mrs. Aurelia Ana da Piedade Miranda alias Araiyo Alvares and others”. In the second appeal judgment was reserved by Justice G.S. Patel vide order dated 10.12.2017. It would be relevant to note that Justice Patel at the relevant time was sitting at the Goa Bench of the Bombay 6.   To complete the facts, it would be relevant to mention that Justice Patel returned to the Principal Bench at Bombay on 24.10.2017. It is also an admitted fact that on 01.11.2017, certain clarifications were made before the Court (Justice Patel) by the parties through Hybrid mode regarding the issue of whether the parties are arriving at a settlement or not. The second appeal was allowed vide judgment and order dated 30.01.2019. The judgment was delivered through virtual mode by the learned Judge while sitting at Bombay. 7.   A Review petition was filed by the respondent on 12.02.2019 registered as Civil Review Application No. 7 of 2019. It was listed before Justice Nutan D. Sardessai and after hearing learned counsel for the review applicant, the same was ordered to be admitted on 04.03.2019. The said order is reproduced “Heard Shri A. Diniz, learned Advocate for the applicants. 8.    At this stage when the notice of the review was served, an application was moved by the appellant on 16.07.2019 registered as Misc. (Civil) Application No.526 of 2019 with the prayer that the Civil Review Application No.7 of 2019 be ordered to be transferred and be placed before Justice G.S. Patel for final disposal. The said application was supported by an affidavit dated 06.06.2019. The prayer clause as contained in paragraph 9 of the application is reproduced below: “9. It is therefore prayed that: (a) The above Civil Review Application No.7/2019 be ordered to be transferred and be placed before his Lordship Justice G.S.Patel in Mumbai for final disposal. (b) Early date for hearing in the matter be fixed.” 9.    The above application has been rejected vide impugned order dated 16.07.2019 by Justice Prithviraj K. Chavan. We are conscious of the fact that normally the names of the judges may not be required to be mentioned in the order but considering the issue involved in the matter, the names have been mentioned. 10. We have heard learned senior counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. 11. Shri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that review petition should be heard by the same Hon’ble Judge under the provisions of Order 47 Rule 5 of the CPC read with High Court amendments made thereunder for the State of Maharashtra. Order 47 Rule 5 was substituted by Maharashtra Government Gazette dated 15.09.1983 to be effective from 01.10.1983. The said provision reads as under: “5. Application for review in Court consisting of two or more judges.- Where the Judge or Judges, or any one of the Judge, who passed the decree or made the order, a review of which is applied for, continues or continue attached to the Court at the time when the application for a review is presented, and is not or are not precluded by absence or other cause for a period of six months next after the application from considering the decree or order to which the application refers, such Judge or Judges or any of them shall hear the application, and no other Judge or Judges of the Court shall hear the same. Bombay - In Order XLVII, for rule 5, substitute the following rule, namely: “ 5. Application for review in Court consisting of two or more Judges.- Where the Judge or Judges, or any one of the Judges who passed the decree or made the order, a review of which is applied for, continues or continue to be attached to the Court at the time when the application for a review is presented, and is not or are not precluded by absence or other cause for a period of two months next after application from considering the decree or order to which the application refers, such Judge or Judges or any of them shall hear the application, and no other Judge or Judges of the Court shall Provided that if in the case of a decree or order passed by a Division Bench of two or more Judges of the High Court sitting at any place in the State of Maharashtra, all the said Judges are not available for sitting together at one place when the review application is ready for hearing, the application may be heard by a Division Bench of two or more Judges, at least one of whom, if available, should be the Judge who had passed the decree or order a review of which is applied for.”” 12. Our attention was also drawn to Chapter XXX Rule 3(1) of the Rules of the Court applicable for the Bombay High Court2 which also provided that it should be heard by the same Judge, however, subject to certain situations where such Judge has ceased to be Judge of the High Court or have ceased to sit at the particular Bench, in that event, it would be placed before the Regular Court of the single Judge dealing with that category of 2 In short “Rules” the matters. The said provision i.e. Rule 3(1) of Chapter XXX of the Rules is reproduced below: “3.(1) An application for review or for amendment of an order or a decree, for speaking to the minutes passed by a Single Judge of this Court shall be placed before that Judge: provided, however, where such Judge has ceased to be the Judge of the High Court or has ceased to sit at the particular Bench, such application shall be placed before the regular Court of the Single Judge dealing with the category of matters to which the proceedings relates as for (a) Writ petition, if the original order had been passed in a Writ Petition; (b) First Appeals, if the original order had been passed in any other Civil matters; (c) Criminal Appeals, if the original order had been passed in any Criminal matters; Provided that, where the Single Judge concerned is not available for the time being by reason of he being on leave or otherwise as aforesaid such application shall be placed before the Court of Single Judge to which the matter may be assigned by the order of the 13. Referring to the above rule, Shri Ahmadi submitted that the Rules having been framed more than 25 years back and considering the advancement of technology and present setup available for virtual hearing through video conferencing and the same Judge being available at the principal seat of the Bombay High Court, the review should have been heard by the same Judge. Shri Ahmadi has also placed reliance upon the following judgments of this Court i.e.: ●    Malthesh Gudda Pooja vs. State of Karnataka3 ●    Goel Ganga Developers India Pvt. Ltd. versus Union of   India  through    Secretary     Ministry    of Environment and Forests and others4 14. On the other hand, Shri Nakul Dewan, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that the appellant ought not to have carried the matter to this court where the proceedings were being conducted as per the Rules. Shri Dewan has sought to impress upon us by analyzing Rule 3(1) of Chapter XXX of the Rules to state and to submit that as Justice Patel was no longer sitting at the Goa Bench, Review Petition had to be heard by the Judge having roster of the said categories of the matters to which the proceedings relate i.e. the learned Judge at the Goa Bench hearing second appeals. Further, reliance has been placed upon by Shri Dewan on the same judgment of Malthesh Gudda Pooja (supra). He has also sought to distinguish the judgment in the case of Goel Ganga Developers India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), relied upon by the appellant as the said proceedings were relating to National Green Tribunal and the procedure prescribed therein. Further reliance is place upon the following two judgements: Authority vs. P V Anturkar5. • Ratanlal Nahata v. Nandita Bose6. 15. Having considered the submissions, we find that the matter does not raise any factual issue, but it is only a question of interpretation          of the  Rules,  the  Court’s propriety and jurisdiction. We do not wish to go into the issue of interpreting the Rules in order to hold as to whether the review should be heard by Judge ‘A’ or any other Judge. However, we are of the view that considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, once an application was preferred by any of the parties that a review may be heard by the Judge who had decided the matter and had passed the order from which the review arose, the matter ought to have been placed before the Chief Justice on the administrative side rather than order being passed on the judicial side. The proviso to Rule 3(1) of Chapter XXX of the Rules confers this power on the Chief Justice to assign a particular matter to a single Judge for hearing of the review application where the single Judge concerned was not available for the time being by reason of being on leave or otherwise as aforesaid i.e. where he had ceased to sit at a particular Bench. The Chief Justice, being the master of roster and being conferred with specific powers of assigning review petitions in given circumstances under the Rules, the learned single Judge ought not to have dealt with the application dated 16.07.2009 (Misc. Civil Application No.526 of 2019), but should have referred the matter to be placed before the Chief Justice. 16. Accordingly, in the facts and circumstances of the case, we allow the appeal, set aside the impugned order dated 16.07.2019 and direct the registry of the High Court to place the said application (Misc. Civil Application No.526 of 2019) on the administrative side before the Hon’ble Chief Justice for appropriate orders.
When these applications for condonation of delay in making and  restoration   of  the   application  for   exemption from surrendering were listed before me, I enquired from the advocate for              the   petitioner   the  need    for  seeking  an   exemption  from surrendering when the order impugned is only a case of cancellation of bail. He says that the Registry normally insists on filing such an application and he has no option. When I informed the counsel that the Rule applies only for Criminal Appeals or Special Leave Petitions  where    the  petitioner  is   ‘sentenced  to  a term   of imprisonment’ and not to SLP’s against cancellation of bail, some lawyers spoke from the Bar and said that they find it prudent to file such applications instead of arguing with the Registry without any success.   This is completely unacceptable. The officers of the Registry must know the Supreme Court Rules like the back of ones hand.      Order XXII Rule 5, applies only to cases where the petitioner is ‘sentenced to a term of imprisonment’ and it cannot be confused with simple orders of cancellation of bail.  What   is   disturbing   is  that   a  large  number of   such applications for exemptions are routinely filed when there is no need to adopt such a procedure at all. This has serious consequence of increasing the burden of lawyers, judges and even the Registry. This is apart from loss of respect for law. I find it necessary to note this position after Sri Raghenth Basant, member of the Bar, has brought to my notice successive orders passed by the Supreme Court holding that applications for surrender were wrongly filed and that there was no need to insist on filing of such applications. The officers could have atleast take note of the following judicial orders, Kapur Singh Vs. State of Haryana 2021 SCC Online 586, Dilip Majumder v. Nikunja Das &Anr. SLP (Crl) Dy. No.6517/2020, Vivek Rai v. High Court of Jharkhand (2015) 12 SCC 86, K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay AIR 1961 SC 112 (para 15) and Mayuram Subramanian Srinivasan v. CBI (2006) 5 SCC 752 (paras 16 to 18), to name a few. Registrar (Judicial) is directed to issue formal instructions to  the  concerned    filing,  scrutiny   and  numbering    Sections  with respect to matters in which Order XX, Rule 3 and Order XXII, Rule 5 will apply.    The officer must also instruct them not to insist on such applications in other cases. Coming back to the facts of the present case, we note that the petitioner was arrested for an offence under Section 420 read with 34 IPC.    He was granted bail by the High Court subject to payment of an amount.     Upon his failure to pay the amount the High Court recalled its order granting bail and ordered the petitioner to surrender. An application to recall that order came to be dismissed by the impugned order. A Special Leave Petition was filed against the above referred order. Along with it an application for exemption from surrendering is  also   filed.   The  advocate   should   have  known    that  such  an application    was   totally    unnecessary.    Chamber    Judge   granted exemption.   However,   as  notice   was   issued  on   the   application, without a direction to list the case before the regular Court for admission, the matter kept coming before the Chamber Court.             On 10.08.2021 the Chamber Judge directed that the petitioner must pay balance   money  within   four   weeks,  if  not,  the   application   for surrendering will be dismissed without reference to the Court.          As the amount was not deposited it was assumed that the application stands dismissed without reference to the Court. It is for this reason   that   the   Advocate   filed   the  present    application   for All this happened when there is no mandate in law to seek an exemption   from   surrendering   at  all.    The   Constitutional  remedy under   Article    136   is   available    to   the   petitioner   without surrendering    as   this   is   not   a  case   where   the   accused   is As this is not a case requiring surrender, there was never a need  to  file   the   application   for   exemption   from  surrendering. However,   as   an   order   directing   dismissal    of  the   so  called application for exemption from surrendering was passed, I shall recall that order and direct the case to be listed before the Regular Bench for admission and disposal. Delay in filing the application for paying balance amount is condoned. Application (I.A. No.123405/2021) for restoration of I.A. No.44732/2021 is allowed. List the case before the Regular Bench for admission. A copy of this order be sent to Secretary General, Supreme Court and Secretary, Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association
1.          Special leave to appeal granted. With the consent of learned counsel for the parties, the appeal was heard finally. 2.          What is involved in this case, is the fixation of date for the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission recommendations, when applied to the respondent Corporation. That framing a policy concerning fixation of pay for the salaries of its employees, the extent of its revision, and even the date of its implementation, are matters of undoubted exclusive executive decision making powers. However, the manner of its implementation, the timing of applicability of a scheme, and its impact, especially where it results in exclusion of a certain section of public employees from the benefit, are subject matters of scrutiny by the court, especially, when the complaint is of discrimination and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. This is one such case. 3.     The    appellant     association     (consisting of  employees    who    had superannuated, opted for VRS, resigned, or legal heirs of expired employees of the respondent corporation) challenge a judgment1 of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur bench). In that proceeding, the appellants had complained of discrimination against the decision dated 29.03.2010, of the Industry, Energy and Labour Department, Government of Maharashtra (hereafter “the State”). That decision denied the benefit of revision of pay scales, as recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission, to the employees of the Maharashtra State Financial Corporation (hereafter “MSFC”) who had retired or died during the period of 01.01.2006 to 29.03.2010. That decision of the State made the revision of pay scale as a result of the Report of the Fifth Pay Commission applicable to 115 employees of MSFC who were working as on 29.03.2010. The revision, however, was given effect from 01.01.2006. 4.      The appellants had urged before the High Court, that denying them the benefit of pay scales was discriminatory and arbitrary, because they were in continuous service, and had even received the benefit of interim revision, pending finalization of pay scales pursuant to the Pay Commission Report. It was urged that those in employment on and after 29.03.2010, and those who continued in service after 01.01.2006 but retired before 29.03.2010, belonged to the same category. The only difference between those who were in service after the latter date, was that they had longer period of service. However, the crucial date for grant of pay revision, was the date from which it was given effect to, i.e., 01.01.2006. As all the appellants were in service as on that date, the denial of pay revision, which was concededly for the period they had worked, amounted to not only hostile discrimination, but also withholding of pay revision benefits, legitimately and rightfully theirs. 5.      By the impugned order, the High Court accepted the submissions of MSFC and the State, that financial considerations were of importance in regard to grant or denial of monetary benefits. The MSFC had also urged before the High Court, that the benefit was granted to those employees on the rolls of the corporation, as of 29.03.2010, in order to motivate and incentivise them for better performance. 6.      After quoting the counter affidavit filed by the State Government, which approved such revision, the High Court accepted MSFC’s argument: ““…It was also considered that there were only 115 employees working in the Respondent No.2 Corporation and the said strength of said employees will further reduce in near future. An expenditure of Rs.16.00 lakhs per month was being incurred on the salary payable to the employees. It was also noted that the Respondent No.2 stopped sanctioning and disbursing loan from the year 2005 and presently only the work of recovery of loans already given is being done. It was also considered that the strength of the employees existing is necessary for carrying out the work of loan recovery. Considering the target of loan recovery fixed for the years 2009-10, it was felt necessary to motivate the existing staff to give benefit of pay revision to employees to work hard for achieving the recovery target. Considering the financial implications, keeping in view the number of employees it was decided to implement 5th pay to the employees of Respondent No.2. Accordingly, considering its income and considering all relevant factors; it was decided that the pay revision based on 5th Pay Commission recommendations should be given only to the existing employees and that the revised pay scales should be made applicable from 01.01.2006. After considering the above fact, the Finance Department of the answering Respondent took decision to approve the revision of pay scale and communicated decision to respondent No.2 vide Government GR No.SFC-2009 (422/Industries-7) dated 29/03/2010, as per the recommendations made by the Finance Department. Accordingly, Government Resolution dated 20.03.2010 was issued. 16. It is specifically denied that the Government Resolution dated 29.03.2010 is discriminatory in nature and violets the fundamental rights of the member of the Petitioner Union. It is submitted that the answering Respondent has already taken policy decision on 16.02.2010 not to extend any budgetary support to any public sector Corporation in the State for the purposes of granting pay revision to its employees. Considering the fact the Respondent No.2 is not a profit making Corporation, the question of pay revision was considered keeping in view the financial implications and the capacity of Respondent No.2 which played development role to bear the additional financial burden on account of such pay revision. At the same time it was noted that it was also necessary to give existing employees pay revision to motivate them to work hard for recovering the loans already disbursed. The pay revision was made effective from 01.01.2006 again keeping in view the financial implications. It is submitted that the decision taken by the answering Respondent is based on objective and rational 7. In the decisions relied upon by Shri Puranik, the learned Counsel for the respondent - Corporation in the matter of revision of pay scale, the Apex Court has clearly laid down that financial implication is the relevant criteria for fixing the cut-off date. The other decisions relied upon by Shri Dhole, the learned Counsel for the petitioners are on the question of payment of pension and other benefits. 8. Keeping in view the justification furnished by the respondent nos.1 and 2, we do not find that fixation of cut off date of 29/3/2010 in the present case is arbitrary or irrational. We, therefore, do not find any substance in the petition.” 7.     Mr. Jay Salva, learned counsel for the appellants argued that the last pay revision was made applicable to MSFC’s employees from 01.01.1986, which expired on 31.12.1989, and MSFC considered pay revision to be made effective from 01.01.1990. Its proposal for pay revision was submitted to the State Government by the Board of Directors of MSFC. The revision of pay and emoluments was approved by MSFC’s Board of Directors, and it was forwarded to the State of Maharashtra for final approval in the year 1996. Pending approval of the said revision, further five revisions were kept due. Instead of considering those revisions, the MSFC’s Board of Directors arbitrarily implemented the pay commission’s recommendations w.e.f. 01.01.1996. The benefits of revised pay were passed on to the existing 115 employees working at the relevant time only, and deprived 900 ex-employees of similar benefits, though the revision was applicable to them for the period of their service time span, respectively. 8.     It was submitted that the cut-off date, for granting benefits of the pay revision, is arbitrary, because several employees had retired, after long years of loyal service. They would be deprived of the benefit of any pay revision, merely because the MSFC chose to implement the decision on a particular date, after their retirement. 9.     It was also urged that the State and the MSFC cannot discriminate between persons who worked during the same period, and discharged their duties in accordance to its mandate, merely because some of them had retired. Thus, the fixation of date, in this case, is arbitrary as it deprives the benefit of pay revision - which is otherwise made applicable to all employees who worked during a particular period - to those who ceased to be in employment, despite working in the said period. It was submitted that those who worked for the period 2000-2005 are in the same class of employees, who worked after the so called cut-off date, i.e., 01.01.2006. 10.    It was submitted that all those in employment, including those who were finally deprived of the pay revision on account of retirement, were granted three interim reliefs by the MSFC from September, 1993 onwards (on 03.03.1994, 29.04.1996, and 07.09.1996) towards the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission, in line with directions of the Maharashtra government. 11.    It was further argued that no recoveries were made (under the impugned GR dated 29.03.2010) of the amount paid towards interim relief and ad hoc amount paid to existing employees from September, 1993 to July, 2001 which shows that the Fifth Pay Commission’s recommendations were implemented 12.    Mr. Salva further submitted that the total liability of the MSFC is not more than ₹32 crores, in respect of past employees, including those who had retired, sought VRS, or had died before the pay revision was made effective. The figure of existing employees, as on the date of the issuance of the order was 114; 130 had retired and 631 had sought voluntary retirement. However, all of them had benefited and secured interim relief to the extent of 30%, through the orders of the MSFC itself. In these circumstances, singling out existing employees from a homogenous larger group, amounted to hostile discrimination against those left out. 13.    It was submitted that those who had sought voluntary retirement cannot be left out, on the ground that they had secured benefits and not completed their tenure. In this regard, Mr. Salva placed reliance on the following condition (Clause 5) of the VRS scheme2: “The officers/employees whose request for voluntary retirement is accepted by the Corporation will be entitled for payment of arrears on account of revision of pay-scales and allowances as also for the difference of voluntary retirement benefits accruing to them on account of revision of pay-scales, if and as may be made effective retrospectively to the employees of the Corporation by the Board and approved by Govt. of Maharashtra and 2       Introduced by the MSFC’s Office Order No. 14 dated 29.03.1996 14.     Reliance was placed on the decisions of this court in Col B.J. Akkara (Retd) v. Govt of India3 , D.S. Nakara v. Union of India4 to urge that the employer cannot discriminate and divide a homogenous class of employees, and deprive one section of them by the artificial device of a cut-off date. 15.     Mr. Sachin Patil, learned counsel appearing for the respondents – the State government, and MSFC, urged that the impugned judgment does not call for interference. It was submitted that MSFC is an autonomous corporation established under the State Financial Corporation Act. It is not bound to follow the terms and conditions applicable to Maharashtra Government employees. In fact, it has to independently generate its income from its own resources to meet any additional burden or expenditure due to increased pay or increase in wages for its employees. It was submitted that under Section 39 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 it has to seek guidance and directives of the State Government in policy matters. 16.     It was submitted that the MSFC was not bound by the decision of the State to implement the decisions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Pay Commissions for its employees. In fact, the State never directed the Corporation to implement such Pay Commission recommendations. It only approved a proposal to extend the benefit of Fifth Pay Commission recommendations to the Corporation’s employees in terms of its letter dated 23.09.2010. Before that, the State refused to grant approval to the resolution passed by the Board of Directors on 24.07.1996. 17.    It was further argued that the employees of the Corporation cannot claim, as a matter of right, any benefit of pay revision without MSFC’s ability to bear the burden of such pay increase. Learned counsel highlighted that the Corporation was running in losses as a result of which there was no justification for granting the benefits in the terms claimed by the appellants. 18.    It was submitted that the fixation of cut-off date is a policy matter, especially in respect of revision of salaries, allowances, and the other benefits to employees of a State Corporation. These depend on various considerations, including financial constraints and the number of employees involved. It was urged that the paying capacity of an employer is an important and valid consideration of such an exercise. Granting any benefit to employees normally involves fixing of cut-off date. If these factors are kept in mind, devising a limited retrospective limit for the employees who are on the rolls of the Corporation lessens the impact of the financial burden. Thus, the fixation of cut- off date in the present case was not arbitrary. 19.     It was urged that the claim of those who retired from the MFSC prematurely by opting for VRS was to benefit both the parties, i.e., the Corporation and the retiring employee. The Corporation benefitted by decreasing its liability towards salary dues; on the other hand, the employee concerned was not bound by any scheme but exercised an independent and voluntary option to seek severance from the employment. For these reasons, such employees were entitled to benefits over and above what they would have earned if they had continued in service by way of ex-gratia payment, in respect of a package which is generally called a golden handshake. The payment of such amounts along with other terminal dues led to cessation of employment; consequently, the claim of such employees who have already secured benefits by way of ex-gratia payouts towards pay revision was not justified. It was submitted that the appellant association’s grievance espouses the cause of 835 ex-employees, a large number of whom are those who opted for voluntary retirement. There can be no complaint of discrimination on their part. It was submitted that apart from financial constraints, the other independent justification for limiting pay benefits to those 115 existing employees is sound, i.e., to motivate them to recover maximum amounts from the Non-Performing Assets (NPA) accounts. This rationale is relevant since the MSFC has incurred losses over the years. 20.    Mr. Patil, learned counsel relied upon some decisions of the Court, A.K. Bindal & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 5; State of Punjab & Ors. v. Amar Nath Goyal & Ors.6 and State of Rajasthan & Anr. v. Amritlal Gandhi & Ors. 7, to urge that the financial implications upon the employer is a relevant factor which the Court must weigh while adjudging whether implementation of any policy is 21.    A close analysis of the facts would show that the question of pay revision of employees of MSFC has been engaging attention for a considerable period of time. Apparently, the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission had been made and were implemented by the State Government with effect from 01.01.1996. However, the MSFC, did not, finalise whether to adopt those scales for its employees and sent the proposal to the State Government (as provided under S. 39 of the State Financial Corporations Act). In the meanwhile, interim relief of pay revision was granted to all existing employees. Some of these orders granting interim relief towards pay revisions have been placed on the record. They are orders/decisions dated 03.03.1994 (Office Order No.191); 03.03.1994 (Office Order No. 19); 11.10.1995 (Office Order No.73); and 07.09.1996 (Office Order No.66), which are part of the appeal records. Those employees who were on the rolls of MSFC between 01.01.1996 and 29.03.2010 concededly enjoyed the benefits of these interim payments. On 29.03.2010, MSFC decided to implement the pay revision recommendations of the Fifth Pay 22.   The decision to make the pay revision effective in respect of the employees who were existing employees and limit the arrears payable from 01.01.2006, is based upon the State of Maharashtra letter dated 29.03.2010 8. That decision was placed on the record during the hearing and reads as follows: “Government of Maharashtra The proposal for implementation of 5th Pay Commission to the employees of Maharashtra State Financial Corporation was under consideration of the Government. The Government has taken following decision in this regard. The Government has given its consent vide this Order for implementation of revised Pay Scales as per 5th Commission subject to the following terms to the employees/officers of Maharashtra State Financial Corporation as shown in Column No.5 of the enclosed Annexure ‘A’. 1. The revised pay as per 5th Pay Commission will be made applicable w.e.f. 01.01.2006 to Officers/Employees on the rolls of the Corporation as mentioned in Column No.3 of the Annexure ‘A’ of the Corporation. 2. No arrears on account of revised pay scales will be made applicable prior to 01.01.2006. 3. Maharashtra State Financial Corporation will have to bear liabilities (Salary and Arrears) on account of above revision in pay scales from its own income. The Government will not make any financial provision for the same. 4. As per revised pay scales, other eligible allowances will be payable to the employees as per rules. 5. The Corporation should obtain an undertaking in respect of revised pay scales from Employees’ Union. 2. This Government decision is issued in terms of Finance Department’s informal reference no.23/2010/PU dated 05.02.2010. In the name and Order of the Governor of Maharashtra.” 23.    By Office Order dated 09.04.2010, the MSFC decided to implement the decision of the Government of Maharashtra and grant the benefits of the Fifth Pay Commission to employees of the Corporation who were on its rolls on that date. That order9 itself contains a reason why the cut-off date was resorted to as is evident from its express terms, i.e., that the State Government approved that cut-off date, “in order to motivate the present staff to recover maximum amount in NPA Accounts”. Relevant para reads as follows: Re: Implementation of Fifth Pay Commission to the Employees of the 1.        The Govt. of Maharashtra in order to motivate the present staff to recover maximum amount in NPA Accounts, vide its GR No.SFC-2009/(422)/Industries-7 dated 29.03.2010 has decided to implement Fifth Pay Commission to the employees of the Corporation who are on the roll of the Corporation as on date of the issue of the Government GR subject to terms and conditions as mentioned in the said 9      Office Order No.1 dated 09.04.2010 24.    The benefit of pay revision was made applicable to the employees of the Corporation; the terms and conditions of fixation and the grant of benefits to the extent they are relevant, are extracted below: (i) The revised pay scale will be made applicable to the employees who are presently on the roll of MSFC as mentioned in the Annexure ‘A’ attached to the Govt. GR dated 29.03.2010. (ii) The revised pay will be fixed w.e.f. 01.01.1996 as per the formula of Fifth Pay (iii) The employees of the Corporation will not be held eligible for arrears from 01.01.1996 to 31.12.2005. (x) Interim Reliefs (IR) paid from 01.01.2006 to 31.03.2010 will be recovered from arrears to be paid to the employees. However, interim reliefs paid from 18.09.96 to 31.12.2005 will not be recovered. (xi) Salary as per revised Pay Scale will be paid from 01.04.2010 and arrears for the period from 01.01.2006 to 31.03.2010 will be paid in two instalments on or before 31st May, 2010.” The fixation of pay as per revised pay-scales condition, in the said order, reads “6.     Fixation of pay as per revised pay scale: The revised pay of the employees of the Corporation will be fixed with effect from 01.01.1996 as per the formula of the Fifth Pay Commission as mentioned below: 3. Add: Amount of 1st Interim Relief i.e. Rs.100/- only. 4. Add: Amount of 2nd Interim Relief i.e. 10% of old Basic Pay (subject to minimum Rs.100/-). 5. Add: 40% of old Basic Pay as on 01.01.1996 as loading. 25.    The appellants have placed on record and relied upon the minutes of MSFC’s Board Meeting dated 06.07.2017, which in Item No.9 had discussed the question of pay revision. The note placed in Item no.2 of the said note reads “2.         The Corporation has granted interim relief from Sept. 1993 towards proposed revision in Pay Sale on line of the Govt. of Maharashtra Besides aforesaid interim relief, the Corporation also gave lumpsum adhoc amount towards Revision of Pay Scale from September, 1996 to July, The note also set out the number of employees concerned, as follows: “There were 950 employees on the roll of the Corporation as on 01.01.1996. The Corporation has worked out arrears amount based on average basis of the amount of the arrears paid to existing employees. The total net liability works out to Rs.39.08 crore after deducting amount of interim relief and ad-hoc payment, the details of which are as under: Sr.No. Particulars          No.      of Estimated     Amount        Net 26.    It is noticeable from the facts that two justifications were provided by the MSFC to deny the benefit of pay revisions, in terms of the Fifth Pay Commission recommendations. One, that it is “in order to motivate the present staff to recover maximum amount in NPA Accounts…” and two, that the fixation of cut-off date falls within the state’s policy making domain, involving among others - an important consideration, which is the state’s financial concerns, which the court should not interfere in. 27.    That on whether, and what should be the extent of pay revision, are undoubtedly matters falling within the domain of executive policy making. At the same time, a larger public interest is involved, impelling revision of pay of public officials and employees. Sound public policy considerations appear to have weighed with the Union and state governments, and other public employers, which have carried out pay revision exercises, periodically (usually once a decade, for the past 50 years or so). The rationale for such periodic pay revisions is to ensure that the salaries and emoluments that public employees enjoy, should keep pace with the increased cost of living and the general inflationary trends, and ensure it does not adversely impact employees. Pay revisions also subserve other objectives, such as enthusing a renewed sense of commitment and loyalty towards public employment. Another important public interest consideration, is that such revisions are meant to deter public servants from the lure of gratification; of supplementing their income by accepting money or other inducements for discharging their functions. 28.      Article 43 of the Constitution10 obliges the state to ensure that all workers, industrial or otherwise, are provided with a living wage and assured of a decent standard of living. In this context, the need for providing a mechanism to neutralize price increase, through dearness allowance has been emphasized, in past decisions of this court. In Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. B.N. Dongre 11, the court explained that if pay packets are “frozen”, the purchasing power of the wage would shrink, and there would be a fall in real wages, which needs to be neutralized. The court also noted neutralization of wages, through dearness allowance is on a “sliding scale” with those at the lowest wage bracket, getting full neutralization and those in the highest rungs being given the least of such 10        “Article 43. Living wage, etc, for workers The State shall endeavour to secure, by suitable legislation or economic organisation or in any other way, to all workers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise, work, a living wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to promote cottage industries on an individual or co-operative basis in rural areas.” “Workers are therefore concerned with the purchasing power of the pay- packet they receive for their toil. If the rise in the pay-packet does not keep pace with the rise in prices of essentials the purchasing power of the pay- packet falls reducing the real wages leaving the workers and their families worse off. Therefore, if on account of inflation prices rise while the pay- packet remains frozen, real wages will fall sharply. This is what happens in periods of inflation. In order to prevent such a fall in real wages different methods are adopted to provide for the rise in prices. In the cost-of-living sliding scale systems the basic wages are automatically adjusted to price changes shown by the cost-of-living index. In this way the purchasing power of workers' wages is maintained to the extent possible and necessary. However, leap-frogging must be avoided. This Court in Clerks & Depot Cashiers of Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd. v. Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd. [AIR 1957 SC 78], held that while awarding dearness allowance cent per cent neutralisation of the price of cost of living should be avoided to check inflationary trends. That is why in Hindustan Times Ltd. v. Workmen [AIR 1963 SC 1332] Das Gupta, J. observed that the whole purpose of granting dearness allowance to workmen being to neutralise the portion of the increase in the cost of living, it should ordinarily be on a sliding scale and provide for an increase when the cost-of-living increases and a decrease when it falls. The same principle was reiterated in Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Workmen [AIR 1969 SC 360] and Shri Chalthan Vibhag Khand Udyog Sahakari Mandli Ltd. v. G.S. Barot, Member, Industrial Court, Gujarat [(1979) 4 SCC 622] and it was emphasised that normally full neutralisation is not given except to the lowest class of employees and that too on a sliding scale.” 29.   Therefore, the state and public employers have an obligation to address – as a measure of public interest, the ill-effects of rise in the cost of living, on account of price rise, which results in fall in real wages. This obligation should be discharged on a periodic basis. Yet, there cannot be any straitjacket formula as to when such pay revisions are to be made and to what extent revisions should take place. As a general practice, the Union and state governments have been undertaking such exercises each decade. 30.   Returning to the facts of this case, it is evident that the respondents have confined the grant of revised pay scales to employees existing as on 29.03.2010. Whilst the fixation of cut-off date for the grant of benefits cannot be questioned, what is within the domain of the court, is to examine the impact of such fixation and whether it results in discrimination. In the present case, the Pay Commission’s recommendations for pay revision were with effect from 01.01.1996. However, the State and MSFC decided not to implement it from that date, but with effect from 01.01.2006, i.e., a decade later, because the benefit given to employees (or arrears) on the rolls of MSFC as on 29.03.2010 were confined or limited to arrears payable from 1 January 2006. At the same time, fitment and fixation of salary was with effect from 1 January 1996, in terms of Para 6 of the MSFC’s circular dated 09.04.2010, which stipulated that revised salary “will be fixed with effect from 01.01.1996 as per the formula of the Fifth Pay Commission as mentioned below”. The formula was: “Old Basic Pay as on 01.01.1996 Add: applicable DA as on 01.01.1996 Add: Amount of 1 st Interim Relief, i.e., Rs.100/- only. Add: Amount of 2 nd Interim Relief, i.e., 10% of old Basic Pay (subject to minimum Rs.100/-). Add: 40% of old Basic Pay as on 01.01.1996 as loading =Total (1 to 5)”. This fitment formula clearly envisioned the fixation in the new scales, even if notionally, from 01.01.1996. Arrears were made payable, based on that fitment and fixation, with effect from 01.01.2006. 31.    Another significant fact is that interim relief had been directed and was made payable, to all employees, between 01.01.1996 and 29.03.2010. The order issued on 09.04.2010 stated that “interim reliefs paid from 18.09.1996 to 31.12.2005 will not be recovered”. This demonstrates that those who retired between these dates, and those who continued in service, form part of the same class. Further, there is also no distinction between those in service as on 01.01.2006 but retired before 29.03.2010 and those who continued thereafter. 32.     This court held in State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa 12 that “Discrimination is the essence of classification and does violence to the constitutional guarantee of equality only if it rests on an unreasonable basis”. The question is whether the classification, excluding employees who retired before 29.03.2010 and confining pay revision benefits (albeit with effect from 01.01.2006) result in discrimination. 33.     In Maharashtra Forest Guards & Foresters Union v. State of Maharashtra13 there was no quota reserved for the graduate Forest Guard for promotion to the post of Forester. Seventy-five per cent of the posts were to be filled through the regular promotion channel based on seniority and twenty-five per cent “by selection of suitable persons from amongst the persons holding the post of Forest Guard, on the basis of common merit list prepared by the Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Administration Subordinate Cadre), Maharashtra State, Nagpur, on the basis of result of the “Limited Departmental Competitive Examination…”. A further condition for those attempting the limited departmental exam was imposed, i.e., that only graduates could apply and appear; that condition was challenged. This court held that the condition was impermissible, as it amounted to creating a class within a class: “The challenge is on the further rigour put on the eligibility to appear in LDCE. The whole purpose of LDCE is to encourage and facilitate the Forest Guards to get accelerated promotion on the basis of merit. Since seniority is the criterion for promotion to three-fourth of the posts, one- fourth is given a chance to compete in a competitive examination. It is also to be noted that there is no quota prescribed on the basis of higher educational qualification. The situation would have been different if, in the first place, there had been a classification wherein 75% of the posts have to be filled based on seniority and 25% reserved for graduates and again subject to inter se merit in the competitive examination. That is not the situation in the present case. The LDCE is meant for selection for promotion from the entire lot of Forest Guards irrespective of seniority but subject to minimum five years of service. In that situation, introducing an additional restriction of graduation for participation in LDCE without there being any quota reserved for graduates will be discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India since it creates a class within a class. The merit of the 25% cannot be prejudged by a sub-classification. It violates the equality and equal opportunity guarantees. The Forest Guards, irrespective of educational qualifications, having formed one class for the purpose of participation in LDCE, a further classification between graduates and non-graduates for participating in LDCE is unreasonable. It is a case of equals being treated unequally.” 34.    In U.P. Raghavendra Acharya & Ors. v. State of Karnataka & Ors., 14 a notification dated 22.07.1999, issued by the State of Karnataka, denied revised scales of pay to those teachers who had retired during the period from 01.01.1996 to 31.03.1998. The High Court held that the impugned notifications were arbitrary as these resulted in discrimination between the teachers working in the government colleges and the teachers working in the Non-Government Colleges, which would mean treating the equals unequally. It was further opined that, in any event, the teachers of the Government Aided Colleges as also the teachers of the Regional Engineering Colleges formed a class by themselves and no discrimination could have been made between the employees who retired prior to 31.03.1998 and those retiring subsequent thereto. This court held that the discrimination, brought about on the basis of date of retirement, “The State while implementing the new scheme for payment of grant of pensionary benefits to its employees, may deny the same to a class of retired employees who were governed by a different set of rules. The extension of the benefits can also be denied to a class of employees if the same is permissible in law. The case of the appellants, however, stands absolutely on a different footing. They had been enjoying the benefit of the revised scales of pay. Recommendations have been made by the Central Government as also the University Grant Commission to the State of Karnataka to extend the benefits of the Pay Revision Committee in their favour. The pay in their case had been revised in 1986 whereas the pay of the employees of the State of Karnataka was revised in 1993. The benefits of the recommendations of the Pay Revision Committee w.e.f. 1.1.1996, thus could not have been denied to the appellants. The stand of the State of Karnataka that the pensionary benefits had been conferred on the appellants w.e.f. 1.4.1998 on the premise that the benefit of the revision of scales of pay to its own employees had been conferred from 1.1.1998, in our opinion, is wholly misconceived. Firstly, because the employees of the State of Karnataka and the appellants, in the matter of grant of benefit of revised scales of pay, do not stand on the same footing as revised scales of pay had been made applicable to their cases from a different date. Secondly, the appellants had been given the benefit of the revised scales of pay w.e.f. 1.1.1996. It is now well settled that a notification can be issued by the State accepting the recommendations of the Pay Revision Committee with retrospective effect as it was beneficent to the employees. Once such a retrospective effect is given to the recommendations of the Pay Revision Committee, the concerned employees despite their reaching the age of superannuation in between the said dates and/or the date of issuance of the notification would be deemed to be getting the said scales of pay as on 1.1.1996. By reason of such notification as the appellants had been derived of a vested right, they could not have been deprived therefrom and that too by reason of executive instructions. The contention of the State that the matter relating to the grant of pensionary benefits vis-à-vis the revision in the scales of pay stands on different footing, thus, must be rejected.” 35.    In All Manipur Pensioners Association by its Secretary v. State of Manipur & Ors.15 the classification by which the formula of pension, whereby those retiring prior to 01.01.1996 were given a lower rate of revised pension, as compared to those retiring later (who were given a higher rate of revision), was held to be discriminatory: “The facts leading to the present appeal in a nutshell are as under : that the State of Manipur adopted the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, as amended from time to time. As per Rule 49 of the Central Civil Services Rules, 1972, a case of a government employee retired in accordance with the provisions of the Rules after completing qualifying service of not less than 30 years, the amount of pension shall be calculated at 50% of the average emoluments subject to a maximum of Rs 4500 per month. It appears that considering the increase in the cost of living, the Government of Manipur decided to increase the quantum of pension as well as the pay of the employees. That the Government of Manipur issued an office memorandum dated 21-4-1999 revising the quantum of pension. However, provided that those Manipur Government employees who retired on or after 1-1-1996 shall be entitled to the revised pension at a higher percentage and those who retired before 1-1-1996 shall be entitled at a lower percentage. Even otherwise on merits also, we are of the firm opinion that there is no valid justification to create two classes viz. one who retired pre-1996 and another who retired post-1996, for the purpose of grant of revised pension. In our view, such a classification has no nexus with the object and purpose of grant of benefit of revised pension. All the pensioners form one class who are entitled to pension as per the pension rules. Article 14 of the Constitution of India ensures to all equality before law and equal protection of laws. At this juncture it is also necessary to examine the concept of valid classification. A valid classification is truly a valid discrimination. It is true that Article 16 of the Constitution of India permits a valid classification. However, a valid classification must be based on a just objective. The result to be achieved by the just objective presupposes the choice of some for differential consideration/treatment over others. A classification to be valid must necessarily satisfy two tests. Firstly, the distinguishing rationale has to be based on a just objective and secondly, the choice of differentiating one set of persons from another, must have a reasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved. The test for a valid classification may be summarised as a distinction based on a classification founded on an intelligible differentia, which has a rational relationship with the object sought to be achieved. Therefore, whenever a cut-off date (as in the present controversy) is fixed to categorise one set of pensioners for favourable consideration over others, the twin test for valid classification or valid discrimination therefore must necessarily be satisfied. In the present case, the classification in question has no reasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved while revising the pension. As observed hereinabove, the object and purpose for revising the pension is due to the increase in the cost of living. All the pensioners form a single class and therefore such a classification for the purpose of grant of revised pension is unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The State cannot arbitrarily pick and choose from amongst similarly situated persons, a cut-off date for extension of benefits especially pensionary benefits. There has to be a classification founded on some rational principle when similarly situated class is differentiated for grant of any benefit. As observed hereinabove, and even it is not in dispute that as such a decision has been taken by the State Government to revise the pension keeping in mind the increase in the cost of living. Increase in the cost of living would affect all the pensioners irrespective of whether they have retired pre-1996 or post-1996. As observed hereinabove, all the pensioners belong to one class. Therefore, by such a classification/cut-off date the equals are treated as unequals and therefore such a classification which has no nexus with the object and purpose of revision of pension is unreasonable, discriminatory and arbitrary and therefore the said classification was rightly set aside by the learned Single Judge of the High Court. At this stage, it is required to be observed that whenever a new benefit is granted and/or new scheme is introduced, it might be possible for the State to provide a cut-off date taking into consideration its financial resources. But the same shall not be applicable with respect to one and single class of persons, the benefit to be given to the one class of persons, who are already otherwise getting the benefits and the question is with respect to revision. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we are of the opinion that the controversy/issue in the present appeal is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in D.S. Nakara [D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, (1983) 1 SCC 305. The decision of this Court in D.S. Nakara shall be applicable with full force to the facts of the case on hand. The Division Bench of the High Court has clearly erred in not following the decision of this Court in D.S. Nakara and has clearly erred in reversing the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge. The impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench is not sustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. The judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge is hereby restored and it is held that all the pensioners, irrespective of their date of retirement viz. pre-1996 retirees shall be entitled to revision in pension on a par with those pensioners who retired post-1996. The arrears be paid to the respective pensioners within a period of three months from today.” 36.    In the present case, too, there is no denial that the employees who retired prior to 29.03.2010 discharged the same duties as in the case of those who did thereafter. The quality and content of responsibilities assigned to them were the same. The respondents’ decision not to grant arrears prior to 01.01.2006 cannot be found fault with; however, not to grant any revision to those who were not in service when the order implementing the pay revision was issued and confining it to those, in employment is clearly discriminatory. The rationale that granting such pay revision only to existing employees would be to enthuse them to recover NPA amounts payable to MSFC has no rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the pay revision, which is to benefit employees and protect them from the rise in the cost of living. 37.     In the present case, therefore, applying the ratio in the above decisions, it is clear that there is no distinction between those who retired (or died in service) before 29.03.2010 and those who continued in service - and were given the pay revision. Those who worked during the period 01.01.2006 to 29.03.2010 and those who continued thereafter, fell in the same class, and a further distinction could not be made. The fact that the MSFC did not recover any interim relief, or ad-hoc amount disbursed between 18.09.1996 to 31.12.2005 (towards recommendations of the 5th Pay Commission), also reaffirms that these ex- employees belonged to the same class as those that received the benefit of the pay revisions. The exclusion of the retired employees, who retired between 01.01.2006 and 29.03.2010 on achieving their date of superannuation, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 38.    However, in the opinion of this court, employees who secured VRS benefits and left the service of MSFC voluntarily during this period, stand on a different footing. They cannot claim parity with those who worked continuously, discharged their functions, and thereafter superannuated. VRS employees chose to opt and leave the service of the corporation; they found the VRS offer beneficial to them. Apart from the normal terminal benefits they were entitled to, the additional amount each of them was given - was an ex- gratia amount, equal to a month’s salary for each completed year of service. Other retired employees were never given such amounts. This has been emphasized in A.K. Bindal v. Union of India (supra): “The Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) which is sometimes called Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) is introduced by companies and industrial establishments in order to reduce the surplus staff and to bring in financial efficiency. The office memorandum dated 5-5-2000 issued by the Government of India provided that for sick and unviable units, the VRS package of the Department of Heavy Industry will be adopted. Under this Scheme an employee is entitled to an ex gratia payment equivalent to 45 days' emoluments (pay + DA) for each completed year of service or the monthly emoluments at the time of retirement multiplied by the balance months of service left before the normal date of retirement, whichever is less. This is in addition to terminal benefits. The Government was conscious about the fact that the pay scales of some of the PSUs had not been revised with effect from 1-1-1992 and therefore it has provided adequate compensation in that regard in the second VRS which was announced for all Central public sector undertakings on 6-11-2001. Clause (a) of the Scheme (a) Ex gratia payment in respect of employees on pay scales at 1-1-1987 and 1-1-1992 levels, computed on their existing pay scales in accordance with the extant Scheme, shall be increased by 100% and 50% respectively. This shows that a considerable amount is to be paid to an employee ex gratia besides the terminal benefits in case he opts for voluntary retirement under the Scheme and his option is accepted. The amount is paid not for doing any work or rendering any service. It is paid in lieu of the employee himself leaving the services of the company or the industrial establishment and foregoing all his claims or rights in the same. It is a package deal of give and take. That is why in the business world it is known as “golden handshake”. The main purpose of paying this amount is to bring about a complete cessation of the jural relationship between the employer and the employee. After the amount is paid and the employee ceases to be under the employment of the company or the undertaking, he leaves with all his rights and there is no question of his again agitating for any kind of his past rights with his erstwhile employer including making any claim with regard to enhancement of pay scale for an earlier period. If the employee is still permitted to raise a grievance regarding enhancement of pay scale from a retrospective date, even after he has opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme and has accepted the amount paid to him, the whole purpose of introducing the Scheme would be totally frustrated.” 39.    For the above reasons, it is held that VRS employees cannot claim parity with others who retired upon achieving the age of superannuation. Likewise, those who ceased to be in employment, for the reason of termination, or their dismissal, etc., would not be entitled to the benefit of pay revision. 40.    In view of the above findings, the impugned judgment and order is hereby set aside. The appeal is accordingly allowed, to the extent that those who retired from the services of MSFC between 01.01.2006 to 29.03.2010, and the legal heirs/representatives of those who died during that period, shall be entitled to arrears based on pay revision, accepted by the Corporation. The Corporation is directed to pay interest @ 8% p.a. on these arrears from 01.04.2010 till the date of this judgment. These amounts shall be calculated and disbursed to those individuals within eight weeks from today. The appeal is partly allowed, in the above terms. There shall be no order on costs.
Applications for intervention and impleadment are Digitally signed by MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. (2)    This miscellaneous application is filed by the Union of India seeking the following clarification: “(a) That persons subject to Army Act, Navy Act and Air Force Act, by virtue of Article 33 of the Constitution of India, being a distinct class, any promiscuous or adulterous acts by such persons should be allowed to be governed by the provisions of Sections 45 or 63 of the Army Act, Sections 45 or 65 of the Air Force Act and Sections 54(2) or 74 of the Navy Act being special legislation and considering the requirements of discipline and proper discharge of their duty.” (3)    The applicant is seeking clarification of the judgment of this Court reported in Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2019) 3 SCC 39.             It must be noticed that the applicant was the sole respondent in the said case. (4)    The reasons which have driven the applicant to seek the clarification are as follows: It is the case of the applicant that this Court has undoubtedly proceeded to find Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPC’ for brevity) as unconstitutional as it offended Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. of India.      However, it is the case of the applicant that officers of the Armed forces are subject to statutory provisions, viz., Army Act, 1950, Navy Act, 1957 and the Air Force Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as ‘Acts’). (5)    Our attention is further drawn to Article 33 of the Constitution which reads as follows: “33. Power of Parliament to modify the rights conferred by this Part in their application to Forces, etc.— Parliament may, by law, determine to what extent any of the rights conferred by this Part shall, in their application to,— (a) the members of the Armed Forces; or (b)the members of the Forces charged with the maintenance of public order; or (c)persons employed in any bureau or other organisation established by the State for purposes        of     intelligence     or  counter intelligence; or (d)person employed in, or in connection with, the telecommunication systems set up for the purposes of any Force, bureau or organisation referred to in clauses (a)to be restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.” (6)    It   is    the   case     of   the   applicant that  the MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. impression has been generated and is sought to be perpetuated that in the light of the judgment of which    the    clarification        is   sought,   nothing    more would survive even if a case is made otherwise under relevant provisions of the Acts in question. (7)    Ms. Madhvi Divan, learned Additional Solicitor General, who appears on behalf of the applicant, drew    our    attention,      as    an   illustration,    to   the following       provisions        of    the    Army   Act,     1950 (hereinafter referred to as ‘1950 Act’ for brevity). Chapter VI deals with offences thereunder.               Our attention is drawn to Section 45: “45. Unbecoming conduct. Any officer, junior commissioned officer or warrant officer       who      behaves     in   a    manner unbecoming         his      position     and     the character expected of him shall, on conviction by court-martial, if he is an officer, be liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and, if he is a junior commissioned officer or a warrant officer, be liable to be dismissed or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.” (8)    She further draws our attention to Section 63: “63.      Violation        of     good    order     and discipline. Any person subject to this Act MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. who is guilty of any act or omission which, though not specified in this Act, is prejudicial to good order and military discipline shall, on conviction by court- martial, be liable to suffer imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.” (9)    Finally, she drew our attention to Section 69: 69.Civil        offences.         Subject  to  the provisions of section 70, any person subject to this Act who at any place in or beyond India commits any civil offence shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence against this Act and, if charged therewith under this section, shall be liable to be tried       by     a     court-martial    and,  on conviction, be punishable as follows, that (a) if the offence is one which would be punishable under any law in force in India with death or with transportation, he shall be liable to suffer any punishment, other than whipping, assigned for the offence, by the aforesaid law and such less      punishment       as     is   in this Act mentioned; and (b) in any other case, he shall be liable to suffer any punishment, other than whipping, assigned for the offence by the law in force in India, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned. (10)   She would immediately point out that in the light of the judgment of this Court in Joseph Shine MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. (supra), since Section 497 IPC has been struck down as unconstitutional and it being a civil offence within the meaning of Section 69 of the 1950 Act, it may    not   be    open    to    the   authorities     to  proceed against an officer under Section 69.                However, it is the   further      case    that    it   will    not  preclude  the authorities from invoking Section 45 and/or Section 63 of the 1950 Act.             There are similar provisions also in the Navy Act and in the Air Force Act. It is her submission that the words adulterous acts would bear the meaning which is assigned to it in the dictionary.           So also the word promiscuous. They need not be found integrally connected with Section 497 IPC as such. (11)   The members of Armed Forces, according to her, are a class apart.           She also drew our attention to the objects and reasons of the 1950 Act.                     It is pointed out that the law was enacted to provide for an exhaustive Code.             It is a complete Code.          It provides for self-regulation.               According to her, the decision of this Court in Joseph Shine (supra) must be   viewed     in   the    context     of    the  institution  of MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. Marriage.       It was not rendered in the context of a workplace.         Expanding further, learned Additional Solicitor General would point out that the setting in which the Armed Forces operate makes it a unique workplace.         Discipline      among     the    members   of  the Force      is     a    matter      which       is    indispensable. Discipline would indeed be impaired, according to her, if the high moral ground to be occupied by the officers      is     diluted.          The     obstacle     for   the authorities invoking Sections 45 and 63 of the 1950 Act   as    also    the   corresponding        provisions     in  the other two Acts will ultimately result in a situation where,     in   the   sensitive      Forces,      which   the   Armed Forces     are,     it    would     engender      and   breed    rank indiscipline.          The    Forces    which      act  as   one  and proceed on the existence of a sense of brotherhood would face breakdown of their morale.                  This was not what was in contemplation of this Court when it pronounced       Section     497    IPC     as   unconstitutional. Section 497 IPC has been struck down on the basis that    it   offended      Articles     14,    15   and  21   of  the Constitution.           The    Court     it     is   contended    was MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. distressed by the resort to values of a bygone era [the    Victorian      era]    and   the    considerations  which persuaded this Court to hold Section 497 IPC as unconstitutional are not germane for the purposes of deciding on the validity or the legality of actions taken under Sections 45 and 63 of the 1950 Act. She,    in   fact,     did    point    out   that  there  was  an element of discord even in the matter of right of privacy which has been advocated in the judgment of one of the learned Judges whereas it has not been so evidenced in the judgment of another Judge.                 There is a command structure in the Armed Forces which it is    indispensable         to    maintain.        Such   command structure would be disturbed.                 She would, in this regard,     ask    us   to   focus     attention   on  the  words ‘unbecoming conduct’ in Section 45 of the 1950 Act. She would submit that in a case where the officer is charged     with    what     is   unbecoming     conduct  and  it consists of an act of adultery, nothing can stand in the way of the authorities taking action. (12)   Pertinently, the learned ASG would also point out that the provisions are gender neutral and it MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. does not suffer from the vice found by this Court when it struck down Section 497 IPC.                  Whoever, it may be, man or woman, who acts in a manner which is found to be unbecoming can be proceeded against, therefore,       under     Section      45   of  the   1950  Act. Equally, she drew our attention to Section 63 and points out the importance of the words ‘military discipline’, viz-a-viz, good order.               In other words, any act or omission which is not specified in the Act and is found to be prejudicial to good order and military      discipline        would     invite    action  under Section 63.       She even went to the extent of pointing out that it can lead to a mutiny.               She would submit that an unrestful breakdown has, in fact, occurred. (13)   She would further point out that Union of India is faced with the following situation: If an action is taken under Sections 45 and 63 of the 1950 Act, it is being challenged.                 The bone of   contention      raised     by   the    officer/personnel  is that the action is tabooed by virtue of the judgment of this Court.          This has led to a number of cases piling up.         There is a certain amount of chaos. MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. This does not conduce to discipline being maintained in the Armed Forces. (14)   Ms. Madhavi Divan, learned Additional Solicitor General, would submit that this Court may, at least, clarify that the judgment of this Court was not concerned with and does not deal with the provisions in question under the Acts. (15)   We    also    have     had    the    benefit   of  hearing Ms.Anannya      Ghosh    and    Mr.    K.   Parameshwar,  learned counsel.          They     are     counsel     who   appear   for intervenors.         It is pointed out by them that the application for clarification may not be allowed. (16)   They would submit that no case is made out for ordering clarification.             Proceedings would have to be decided on the facts as are relevant to each case.     The application for clarification may not be the solution to the problem which is projected by the applicant.         In the individual cases where this question may arise, it is for the applicant to work out its remedies and this Court may not issue an omnibus clarification. MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. (17)   Mr. Kaleeswaran Raj, learned counsel, appears for    the   petitioner-Joseph          Shine   in  the   judgment sought to be clarified. He    would     submit     that     the   application    for clarification        may   not    be    entertained.      In   this regard, he drew our attention to an Order of this Court in Supertech Limited v. Emerald Court Owner Resident         Welfare         Association        and     Others (Miscellaneous Application No. 1572 of 2021 in Civil Appeal No. 5041 of 2021).                The Court notices that the    applicant      therein     was    seeking   the   following “(a)        Modify        the       judgment     dated 31.08.2021...to           the     extent    that    the Applicant may demolish a part of tower T- 17      as     stipulated         in    paragraph     6 hereinabove; (b) Pass an order of status quo in respect of Towers 16 & 17 in Emerald Court, Plot No. 4, Sector 93A, NOIDA till final orders are passed in the present application.” (18)   No doubt, this Court has proceeded to go into the    question      as   to    the    maintainability     of   the application.        In doing so, the Court has followed the judgment by this Court in Delhi Administration MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. v. Gurdip Singh Uban and Others (2000) 7 SCC 296: “In successive decisions, this Court has held that the filing of applications styled as “miscellaneous applications” or “applications                                      for clarification/modification” in the guise of a review cannot be countenanced.                 In Jagannadha Rao, speaking for a two-Judge Bench of this Court observed: “17.We next come to applications described        as      applications    for “clarification”, “modification” or “recall” of judgments or orders finally passed. We may point out that under the relevant Rule XL of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 a review application has first to go before       the     learned     Judges   in circulation and it will be for the Court      to     consider     whether   the application        is     to   be   rejected without giving an oral hearing or whether notice is to be issued. Order XL Rule 3 states as follows: “3. Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, an     application        for    review    shall   be disposed of by circulation without any oral arguments, but the petitioner may supplement his petition by additional written arguments. The Court may either dismiss the petition or direct notice to the opposite party....” In case notice is issued, the review petition will be listed for hearing, after notice is served. This procedure is meant to save the time of the Court and to preclude frivolous review petitions being filed and heard in open court. However, with a view to avoid this procedure of “no MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. hearing”,         we      find     that     sometimes applications              are         filed       for “clarification”,              “modification”       or “recall”       etc.      not    because    any   such clarification,          modification      is   indeed necessary but because the applicant in reality wants a review and also wants a hearing, thus avoiding listing of the same in chambers by way of circulation. Such applications, if they are in substance review       applications,         deserve    to   be rejected straight away inasmuch as the attempt is obviously to bypass Order XL Rule 3 relating to circulation of the application in chambers for consideration without oral hearing. By describing an application as one for “clarification” or “modification”, — though it is really one of review — a party cannot be permitted to circumvent or bypass the circulation procedure and indirectly obtain a hearing in the open court.             What cannot be done directly cannot be permitted to be done indirectly. (See in this connection a detailed order of the then Registrar of this Court in Sone Lal v. State of U.P. [(1982) 2 SCC 398] deprecating a similar practice.) 18. We, therefore, agree with the learned Solicitor General that the Court should not permit hearing of such an application for “clarification”, “modification” or “recall”       if     the     application     is   in substance one for review. In that event, the     Court      could      either     reject   the application straight away with or without costs or permit withdrawal with leave to file a review application to be listed initially in chambers.” (19)   This view apparently has found acceptance in MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. the subsequent judgments.             It was found undoubtedly in the facts of the said case that the application sought     substantive       modification     of   the    judgment. Thereafter,      undoubtedly,        this   Court   also   held  as “12          The     hallmark      of    a    judicial pronouncement          is     its     stability     and finality. Judicial verdicts are not like sand dunes which are subject to the vagaries of wind and weather (See Meghmala v G Narasimha Reddy, (2010) 8 SCC 383). A disturbing trend has emerged in this court of     repeated        applications,       styled    as Miscellaneous Applications, being filed after       a     final       judgment      has    been pronounced. Such a practice has no legal foundation and must be firmly discouraged. It     reduces       litigation      to    a    gambit. Miscellaneous Applications are becoming a preferred course to those with resources to pursue strategies to avoid compliance with      judicial       decisions.      A    judicial pronouncement          cannot      be    subject     to modification once the judgment has been pronounced, by filing a miscellaneous application. Filing of a miscellaneous application                                     seeking modification/clarification of a judgment is not envisaged in law. Further, it is a settled legal principle that one cannot do indirectly what one cannot do directly [“Quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo, prohibetur et per obliquum”]. (20)   He would submit that there is no occasion for the applicant to file the present application. MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. (21)   Learned counsel for the petitioner in the main case would, in fact, agree with the applicant that the    questions       which     have     been   raised   in   the application       seeking     clarification      were  not   those which arose for consideration in the judgment sought to be clarified.          This Court was concerned with the validity of Section 497 IPC.                It pronounced on the same.      It had nothing to do with the provisions under the Acts. (22)   He would submit that no occasion has arisen for this Court to clarify the order accordingly.                    In fact, this Court posed the following question.                In a given    case,     the   authority      is   presented  with   the following set of facts.               An officer is proceeded against under Section 45 of the 1950 Act; the charge against him is adultery; it is alleged, in other words, that he has committed adultery within the meaning of Section 497 IPC which has been struck down.     Mr. Kaleeswaram Raj, learned counsel for the original petitioner, very fairly submits that, the fact that Section 497 IPC has been struck down may not stand in the way of the authorities proceeding MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. against the officer with the aid of the provisions contained in Section 45 of the 1950 Act. Of course, he adds that the decision must finally depend upon the play of facts. (23)   This     Court     in    the    case    in   question    was concerned only with the validity of Section 497 IPC and    Section      198    (2)    of    the   Code    of   Criminal Procedure,        1973     (hereinafter        referred     to   as ‘Cr.P.C.’ for brevity).              This Court spoke through separate but concurrent judgments.                 Apart from the lead judgment of Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dipak Misra, former Chief Justice of this Court, and with whom, Hon’ble Mr. Justice A. M. Khanwilkar concurred, the other     learned      Judges      wrote     separate    opinions. However,      they    agreed     that     Section    497   IPC  and Section     198    Cr.P.C.     were     unconstitutional.       The premise on which the provision was struck down was that    it   offended     Articles      14,   15  and   21  of  the In   this    case,     this    Court    had   no  occasion, whatsoever, to consider the effect of the provisions of the Acts in question.                In fact, we may notice MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. that    it    is   not     as   if    this    Court   approved   of adultery.      This Court has found that adultery may be a    moral     wrong     (per     Hon’ble     Ms.    Justice   Indu Malhotra).        This Court has also held that it will continue to be a ground for securing dissolution of marriage.       It has also been described as a civil wrong. (24)     In view of the fact that the scheme of the Acts in the context, in particular, of Article 33 of the Constitution did not fall for the consideration of this Court, we must necessarily observe and clarify that the judgment of this Court in Joseph Shine v. Union     of   India     (2019)     3   SCC   39   was  not  at   all concerned       with    the    effect      and   operation   of   the relevant      provisions       in   the    Acts   which   have   been placed before us by the applicant.                  In other words, this    Court     was     neither     called     upon  nor   has   it ventured to pronounce on the effect of Sections 45 and 63 of the 1950 Act as also the corresponding provisions in other Acts or any other provisions of the Acts. (25)   We only make this position clear and dispose of MA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017 etc. the miscellaneous application. Pending applications stand disposed of. (26)   Application for impleadment is allowed. (27)   The miscellaneous application stands disposed of.    Pending applications stand disposed of.
The applicant is accused in an offence bearing FIR No.I-240 of 2015 registered with Vashi Police Station under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO Act). The offence was registered on the complaint of Mr. Amardas P. Bhalla, the father of the victim-girl. He filed complaint for sexual abuse and sexual harassment of her minor daughter by the applicant. The applicant was arrested. The police have also filed charge- sheet and is pending as POSCO Special Act No. 198 of 2015 before the Special Court at Thane. 2            During pendency of the prosecution, through intervention and well wishers, applicant has settled the dispute with Respondent No.2. Now she has become major. Today, both the parties are present in the 3            We have heard the learned Counsel for the applicant, learned APP and the learned Counsel for Respondent No.2. 4            We have read the affidavit filed by the victim-girl. Now, she is major. It seems that, they were in love with each other. Now they have decided to marry after settling in life in their respective careers. Her parents have also filed affidavits. They have given explanation of misunderstanding while lodging the FIR. Even now they have accepted the friendship in between their daughter and the appellant. The victim- girl tried to give an explanation about her statement recorded by the Police and learned Magistrate. She was tutored to give those statements. We are not accepting the said explanation. 5            We are inclined to accept the prayer for quashing for the reasons that both have agreed to marry. We accept her readiness as an undertaking given today to this Court. Victim-girl had given no objection for quashing. When the applicant is present in the Court, we also asked about his readiness to marry with the victim-girl, he has given an undertaking to marry to her. We have accepted as an undertaking given to 6              So we are inclined to accept the request for quashing the FIR, only by considering their future. If the prosecution still remains, it will come in their peaceful life. (b)      FIR No.I-240 of 2015 registered with Vashi Police Station under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO Act), is quashed and set aside. (c)      Applicant to file affidavit to that effect within 15 days. If the affidavit is not filed, then the prosecution will revive.

2.      The present batch of petitions concerns the loss of investor wealth in the securities market over the last few weeks because of a steep decline in the share price of the Adani Group of companies. The decline in the share price was precipitated by a report published by Hindenburg Research on 24 January 2023. This report inter alia alleges that the Adani Group of companies has manipulated its share prices; failed to disclose transactions with related parties and other relevant information concerning related parties in contravention of the regulations framed by SEBI; and violated other provisions of securities laws. The report also states that Hindenburg Research has taken a short position in the Adani Group companies through US traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivative instruments. It is in this background that the present batch of petitions came to be filed. 3.      A brief overview of the petitions follows: a.      WP(C) No. 162 of 2023 states that public money amounting to thousands of crores is at risk because public institutions like the State Bank of India1 and the Life Insurance Corporation of India2 are exposed to the Adani Group. It inter alia seeks the issuance of directions to the Union of India and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to constitute a committee headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court to investigate the contents of the report published by Hindenburg Research; b.      WP(Crl) No. 39 of 2023 is for the issuance of directions to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to register an FIR against Mr. Nathan Anderson (founder of Hindenburg Research) and his associates for short selling, and for directions to recover the profits yielded by the short selling to compensate investors; c.      WP(C) No. 201 of 2023 inter alia states that “the Adani Group has been in flagrant violation of ... Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules by surreptitiously controlling more than 75% of the shares of public listed Adani group companies, thereby manipulating the price of its shares in the market.” It inter alia seeks a court monitored investigation by a Special Investigation Team or by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the allegations of fraud and the role played by top officials of leading public sector banks and other lender institutions; and d.       WP(Crl) 57 of 2023 is for directions to any investigative authority to: (i) investigate the Adani Group companies under the supervision of a sitting judge of this Court; and (ii) investigate the role of LIC and SBI in these transactions. 4.       In its order dated 10 February 2023, this Court noted that there was a need to review existing regulatory mechanisms in the financial sector to ensure that they are strengthened with a view to protect Indian investors from volatilities in the market. Accordingly, it was suggested to the Solicitor General that he may seek instructions from the Union of India on the constitution and remit of an expert committee. 5.       We have heard Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners and Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India. Both of them have also placed on record brief notes indicating their suggestions for the remit of the expert committee to be constituted. Further, SEBI has placed on record a brief note on the factual and legal aspects describing the existing statutory regime, regulatory mechanisms and frameworks in place for the protection of investors. It has also laid out the regulatory framework governing short selling. Mr Vishal Tiwari and Mr Manohar Lal Sharma have appeared in person. a.       It has adopted a disclosure based regulatory regime for both issuance of and trading in securities. This is in line with the discontinuation of pricing control for capital issues in favour of the principle of free discovery by the markets based on demand and supply from b.       It is “strongly and adequately empowered to put in place regulatory frameworks for effecting stable operations and development of the securities markets including protection of investors.” It has also detailed the extant framework governing investor protection in the context of the subject matter at hand. It has stated that the key pillars of investor protection “11.1 Mandatory disclosures by listed companies to facilitate free and fair price discovery and to ensure that all investors have equal access to material information for them to be able to take informed investment decisions; 11.2     Market systems to ensure seamless trading and settlement including volatility 11.3     Enforcement action in the event of misconduct in the market including fraud or violations of SEBI regulations.” 7.       In Prakash Gupta v. SEBI,3 a two Judge Bench of this Court, of which one of us (D.Y. Chandrachud, J) was a part discussed the specialized regulatory role of SEBI and “99. The provisions of the SEBI Act, as analyzed earlier in this judgment, would indicate the importance of the role which has been ascribed to it as a regulatory, adjudicatory and prosecuting agency. SEBI has vital functions to discharge in the context of maintaining an orderly and stable securities’ market so as to protect the interests of investors.” 8.      On the subject matter of these petitions, SEBI has stated that: “21.1 SEBI is already enquiring into both, the allegations made in the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report, to identify violations of SEBI Regulations including but not limited to SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices I relating to Securities Market) Regulations 2003, SEBI (Prohibition of Derivative Instruments (ODI) norms, short selling norms, if any. As the matter is in early stages of examination, it may not be appropriate to list details about the ongoing proceedings at this 9.      In view of the above statement, it appears that SEBI is seized of the investigation into the allegations made against the Adani Group companies. SEBI has not expressly referred to an investigation into the alleged violation of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules 1957 which provide for the maintenance of minimum public shareholding in a public limited company. Similarly, there may be various other allegations that SEBI must include in its investigation. 10.     As a part of its ongoing investigation, SEBI shall also investigate the following aspects of the issues raised in the present batch of petitions: a.      Whether there has been a violation of Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts b.      Whether there has been a failure to disclose transactions with related parties and other relevant information which concerns related parties to SEBI, in accordance with law; c.      Whether there was any manipulation of stock prices in contravention of existing 11.     The above directions shall not be construed to limit the contours of the ongoing investigation. SEBI shall expeditiously conclude the investigation within two months and file a status report. 12.     Further, SEBI shall apprise the expert committee (constituted in paragraph 14 of this order) of the action that it has taken in furtherance of the directions of this Court as well as the steps that it has taken in furtherance of its ongoing investigation. The constitution of the expert committee does not divest SEBI of its powers or responsibilities in continuing with its investigation into the recent volatility in the securities market. 13.     In Prakash Gupta (supra), we took note of the developing nature of the regulations pertaining to the securities market. This Court noted that: “101. Therefore, the SEBI Act and the rules, regulations and circulars made or issued under the legislation, are constantly evolving with a concerted aim to enforce order in the securities market and promote its healthy growth while protecting investor wealth.” 14.     In order to protect Indian investors against volatility of the kind which has been witnessed in the recent past, we are of the view that it is appropriate to constitute an Expert Committee for the assessment of the extant regulatory framework and for making recommendations to strengthen it. We hereby constitute a committee consisting of the The Expert Committee shall be headed by Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre, a former judge of the Supreme Court of India. a.      To provide an overall assessment of the situation including the relevant causal factors which have led to the volatility in the securities market in the recent past; b.      To suggest measures to strengthen investor awareness; c.      To investigate whether there has been regulatory failure in dealing with the alleged contravention of laws pertaining to the securities market in relation to the Adani Group or d.      To suggest measures to (i) strengthen the statutory and/or regulatory framework; and (ii) secure compliance with the existing framework for the protection of investors. 16.     The Chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India is requested to ensure that all requisite information is provided to the Committee. All agencies of the Union Government including agencies connected with financial regulation, fiscal agencies and law enforcement agencies shall co-operate with the Committee. The Committee is at liberty to seek recourse to external experts in its work. 17.     The honorarium payable to the members of the Committee shall be fixed by the Chairperson and shall be borne by the Union Government. The Secretary, Ministry of Finance shall nominate a senior officer who will act as a nodal officer to provide logistical assistance to the Committee. All the expenses incurred in connection with the work of the Committee shall be defrayed by the Union Government. 18.     The Committee is requested to furnish its report in sealed cover to this Court within two months.
The present Application is filed under the Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (for brevity ‘IBC, 2016’) read with Rule 4 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 by M/s. Dalmia Group Holdings through Authorized Representative of the Proprietor, Mr. Inder Preet Singh (for brevity ‘Applicant/Financial Creditor’), with a prayer to initiate the Corporate Insolvency process against M/s. Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Limited (for brevity ‘Corporate Debtor’). 2.      The Corporate Debtor namely, M/s. Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Limited is a Company incorporated on 30.06.1967, under the provisions of the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 with CIN L45101DL1967PLC004759, having its registered office at 115, Ansal Bhawan, 16, Kasturba Gandhi Marg, New Dellii-110001, which is within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. 3.      The Authorized Share Capital of the Corporate Debtor Company is Rs.1,50,00,00,000/- and Paid-up Share Capital of the Company is Rs.78,70,24,380/- as per the master data annexed with the Application. 4.      That the detailed particulars of the Financial Debt including the total amount of debt in default and the date of default as mentioned in the Part IV of the application are reproduced below for the convenience : 5.      That from perusal of the Part IV of the Application, it is observed that the Applicant has claimed the dues of Rs. 04,88,20,618/- as on 30.09.2021, out of which Rs 01,40,00,000/- has been claimed as the Principal Amount. The Applicant has mentioned the 28.10.2015 as the date of default in its application. That in order to cross the hurdle of limitation, the Applicant has filed Annual Reports of the Corporate Debtor for the Financial Years 2017-18 to 2019-20 along with its application. 6.      That vide order dated 24.05.2022, this Bench has observed that the present Application has been preferred in the name of the Proprietorship firm, accordingly, the defect being curable, the Applicant was directed to rectify the memo of parties within seven days. That in compliance of the direction, the Applicant filed the amended memo of parties on 26.05.2022 rectifying the cause title of the case. The same is taken on record. 7.      That during the course of hearing on 24.04.2022, the arguments were heard on merits and the order was reserved. Subsequent to reserving of the order, one IA No.2283/2022 was filed by the Corporate Debtor stating that an amount of Rs. 04,90,00,000/- has been transferred in the account of the Financial Creditor on 16.05.2022. 8.      That vide order dated 18.05.2022, this Adjudicating Authority had directed the Financial Creditor to confirm whether any amount has been received by it. Accordingly, the matter was posted for 26.05.2022. 9.       The Financial Creditor, in response to the same, has filed its reply in IA-2283 of 2022 and has confirmed that it has received an amount of Rs. 04,90,00,000/- in its accounts. However, it has stated that it is not the full amount, which was required to be paid by the Corporate Debtor. 10.      That the scanned copy of the relevant averments made by the Financial Creditor are reproduced below : 11.     That the Financial Creditor has also annexed the Calculation sheet stating that still there is a balance amount of Rs. 65,83,033/- outstanding towards the principal dues. The scanned copy of the Calculation Sheet filed by the Financial Creditor is reproduced below : 12.     That during the course of hearing on 26.05.2022 in IA-2283 of 2022, Ld. Sr. Counsel appearing for the Financial Creditor further submitted that there is still the principal amount due and payable by the Corporate Debtor and hence, it insisted on initiation of the CIRP. 13.     It was further stated by the Ld. Sr. Counsel appearing for the Financial Creditor that there was no settlement between the parties and the aforesaid amount has been deposited by the Corporate Debtor, without any prior consent of the Financial Creditor. 14.      Per Contra, Ld. Counsel for the Corporate Debtor stated that the entire amount claimed in the Part IV of the Application has been discharged including the principal amount. He further argued that the said amount has not been returned by the Applicant at any stage. He further placed reliance on the Judgement of this Bench passed in the matter of Saraf Chits Private Limited Vs. KAD Housing Private Limited in (IB)-255(ND)/2021, dated 23.05.2022 stating that in the light of discharge of the entire Principal amount claimed in part IV of the Application, the CIR process cannot be initiated against the corporate debtor. 15.      That after hearing submissions of both the parties, this Bench observes that the Corporate Debtor had transferred an amount of Rs.04,90,00,000/- in the Financial Creditor’s Account and the said fact is duly admitted by the Financial Creditor. Although it is contended by the Financial Creditor that the Corporate Debtor had deposited the money without its prior permission. However, since the amount has not been returned by the Financial Creditor, we shall consider this issue while adjudicating the debt and default. 16.      That from the pleadings, it is observed that pursuant to the deposit of Rs. 04,90,00,000/- by the Corporate Debtor in the accounts of Financial Creditor, both the parties are adjusting the said amount in their own manner. That the Financial Creditor has adjusted the amount of Rs.04,90,00,000/- in the interest portion calculated till 24.05.2022 and has reached to a conclusion that Rs.65,83,033/- has been outstanding as the Principal Amount. Per Contra, the Corporate Debtor has stated that the payment of Rs 04,90,00,000/- has resulted in complete discharge of the full Principal amount of Rs.01,40,00,000/- as well as the interest as claimed by the applicant in the Part IV of its Application. 17.     Here, for the sake of convenience, we again refer to the relevant extracts of Part IV of the Application depicting the amount claimed, the scanned copy of which is reproduced below : From the perusal of the aforesaid relevant extracts of Part IV of the Application, it is observed that the Financial Creditor had claimed the total  dues    Rs.04,88,20,618/-           as    on 30.09.2021, out of   which Rs.01,40,00,000/- is the principal amount and the rest is interest portion calculated as on 30.09.2021. 18.      From the above, it can be inferred that the Corporate Debt has computed its debt as on 30.09.2021, which became due and payable on 28.10.2015, as per the date of default mentioned in Part IV of the 19.      That the aforesaid facts depict that the Applicant has also claimed interest portion falling within the Section 10A period, i.e the suspended period of IBC commencing from 25.03.2020 to 24.03.2021, for which no CIRP can ever be initiated. 20.      That before deposit of Rs.04,90,00,000/- by the Corporate Debtor, the said fact was not relevant, since the Principal Outstanding claimed in the Part IV of the Application was above Rs 1 Crore, which was due and payable much prior to the Suspension period of IBC as stipulated under Section 10A of IBC, 2016. 21.      It is observed that the Applicant had claimed the unpaid financial debt of Rs.04,88,20,618/- as the total outstanding amount in Part IV of the Application. Even if we ignore, for a moment, that the Financial Creditor had claimed interest for the 10A period, then also it is amply clear   that    the  Financial       Creditor     had     received an amount       of Rs.04,90,00,000/-, which is more than the total amount (Principal + Interest) of Rs.04,88,20,618/- claimed in Part IV of the Application. Therefore, in our considered view, the Applicant cannot claim any amount beyond what is stated/claimed in the Part IV of its Application, since it is a trite law that the IBC proceedings are not recovery proceedings. 22.      Further, it is observed that the Financial Creditor has erroneously calculated the unpaid Principal outstanding amount of Rs.65,83,033/- after adjusting the amount payable during the 10A period and the interest for the period beyond filing of the present Application under Section 7 of IBC, 2016. In our considered view, such a calculation cannot be accepted for arriving at the unpaid debt for triggering the CIR process of the Corporate Debtor. 23.      In view of the above discussion, the Application is Dismissed and the IA-2283 of 2022 is disposed of. 24.      However, we take note of the conduct of the Corporate Debtor that not only it had made all possible efforts to delay the matter, but also it had deposited the amount behind the back of the Financial Creditor and without its consent and that too, when the order was reserved. Therefore, we impose a cost of Rs.1,00,000/- (One Lakh) only on the Corporate Debtor, which shall be deposited in the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund within 15 days, receipt of which shall be filed before this Bench before
1.      Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 23.10.2013 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Letters Patent Appeal Nos. 2130/2011 and 2131/2011 and the subsequent order dated 17.12.2013 passed in CM No. 5249/2013 in LPA No. 2130/2011, by which, the Division Bench of the High Court has dismissed the Said Letters Patent Appeals thereby confirming the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petitions, the original writ petitioner has preferred the present appeals. 2.      The facts leading to the present appeals in a nutshell are as under: - 2.1     That the appellant became the owner of Shop No. 27 situated in the Agricultural Produce Market, Chandigarh. Respondent No. 5 herein was the tenant of the said shop. Both the appellant as well as respondent No. 5 were holding the requisite licences to do business in the market area. Ejectment proceedings were initiated by the appellant against respondent No. 5. The order of ejectment came to be confirmed by the High Court. Therefore, respondent No. 5 shifted as a tenant to Shop No. 12 in the year 2007 and applied for change of address to the new shop, however, the same was rejected and respondent No. 5 was asked to surrender his licence and apply for new one. The appellant applied for licence for selling fruits/vegetables and State Agricultural Marketing Board issued the same. Since then, the appellant is running the business from Shop No. 27 owned by him. Respondent No. 5 filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the order dated 05.07.2007 by which his application for change of address to the new Shop No. 12 was rejected. The order dated 05.07.2007 was stayed. The stay was continued up to 31.03.2009 i.e., till the validity of licence of respondent No. 5. That thereafter, the Market Committee, Chandigarh rejected the application of respondent No. 5 for renewal of licence. The same was the subject matter of another writ petition before the High Court being Writ Petition No. 5886/2009. That pursuant to the order passed by the High Court, respondent No. 5 continued to function as per the old licence. That the Licence Committee constituted under Licensing of Auction Platform Rules, 1981 decided that the site in the platform would be allotted on the basis of “One Site One Shop” and the name of respondent No. 5 was shown as co-allottee along with the appellant. Aggrieved with this, the appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court, being Writ Petition No. 12684/2009. The High Court by a common judgment and order dated 26.09.2011 allowed Writ Petition No. 5886/2009 filed by respondent No. 5 and directed that the licence of respondent No. 5 be renewed. The High Court also held that respondent No. 5 is entitled to use the platform in front of Shop No. 27 till any alternative policy comes by way of amendment in the Act or the Rules, pertaining to the issue of rights to use the platform. The learned Single Judge also held that right to use the platform and to have the licence to do the business in the market area both are distinct and different and the two rights were not directly linked. 2.2     Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the common judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court the appellant preferred the letters patent appeals before the Division Bench of the High Court. By the impugned common judgment and order the Division Bench of the High Court has dismissed the said letters patent appeals and has confirmed the order passed by the learned Single Judge holding that right to use the shop and/or having a licence and right to use the platform are not directly related. The Division Bench of the High court also observed that respondent No. 5 is using the platform since 1970 i.e., much prior to the appellant getting the licence and therefore, being a senior licencee, he gets the right to use the platform allotted to him i.e., in front of Shop No. 27. 2.3     Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court the original writ petitioner – licence holder and owner of Shop No. 27 who is also claiming the right to use the platform in front of Shop No. 27 has preferred the present appeals. 3.      Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellant(s) has vehemently submitted that the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court have materially erred in confirming the allotment of the auction platform in question, in favour of original respondent No. 5. 3.1     It is submitted that the appellant herein was granted the licence in the year 2007, however, so far as respondent No. 5 is concerned, he applied for a fresh licence/renewal in the year 2009 and he was issued a fresh licence in the year 2010 and therefore, as per seniority the appellant herein was entitled to priority. 3.2     It is further submitted that even at the time of submitting the application for fresh licence/renewal in the year 2009, respondent No. 5 submitted an affidavit dated 20.08.2009 deposing that he will not claim any right over the auction platform. That in fact the licence was issued only after the said affidavit. 3.3     It is next submitted that the High Court has materially erred in observing and holding that carrying on the business in the shop and on the auction platform both are distinct and separate. That the right to use a particular site in the platform is connected with the right to use the particular corresponding shop in view of the clear policy of the board i.e., “One Site 3.4     It is contended that the appellant herein is doing the business, has the licence and he is allotted shop no. 27 and therefore, he is entitled to the allotment of the auction platform adjacent to and/or in front of shop No. 27. 3.5     It is further contended that so far as respondent No. 5 is concerned, he is doing business in shop No. 12 therefore, not to permit the appellant(s) to do business on the auction platform which is adjacent to shop No. 27 and allotting auction platform to respondent No. 5 who is doing business in shop no. 12, just adjacent to shop No. 27 is unreasonable and 3.6     It is next contended that the appellant(s) herein approached the learned Single Judge challenging the coallotment of the site to respondent No. 5. That in any case the appellant(s) do not succeed in such challenge, they cannot be worse of compared to the position which they were in prior to filing of the writ petition. 4.      Present appeals are vehemently opposed by Shri Vatsal Joshi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Chandigarh Market Committee. It is vehemently submitted that after the interim order dated 05.08.2016 was passed by this Court, the representation made by the appellant herein has been dealt with and considered by the Market Committee and a detailed reasoned order has been passed by the Market Committee rejecting the representation of the appellant. 4.1     It is further submitted that the allotment of auction platform is to be made as per the policy. That it is rightly observed and held by the High Court that to do business in the shop and on the auction platform are different and distinct. That as such there is no policy and/or rule pointed out on behalf of the appellant that a licence holder is entitled to carry on the business and/or allotment of the auction platform just adjacent to and/or in front of shop occupied by him. 4.2     It is next submitted that as respondent No. 5 was found to be doing business since 1970 and thereafter, he applied for renewal of the licence in the year 2009; he has been allotted the platform in front of shop No. 27. 4.3     It is vehemently submitted that the appellant and/or any other licence holder doing business in the respective shop cannot as a matter of right claim allotment of the auction platform at a particular place. 4.4     It is contended that as such, existing sheds in the Market Committee collapsed on 10.06.2007 and thereafter, sheds were reconstructed in the year 2009. That thereafter, the Secretary Agriculture, U.T. Chandigarh laid down the principles and guidelines at the first instance, all those allottees, who were allotted sheds for working prior to collapse of sheds on 10.06.2007 were entitled to be allotted shed/space as they existed on the date when the shed collapsed. That the appellant was issued the licence on 16.07.2007 whereas the sheds collapsed on 10.06.2007, therefore, the appellant was not in possession of the shed earlier to the collapse on 10.06.2007 and therefore, his case is not covered under the aforesaid 4.5     It is further contended that the action of the Market Committee in allotting the sheds is absolutely in consonance with the guidelines/policy laid down by the Secretary, Agriculture 5.      While opposing the present appeals, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No. 5 has argued that as such respondent No. 5 was carrying on business on the platform even at the time of the collapse of shed on 10.06.2007 and was having a valid licence since 1970. However, at the time of allotment of newly constructed sheds, licence of the firm was not valid due to non-renewal and the case for grant of licence was pending for consideration in the office of the Committee, and the same was finally granted in the month of February, 2010. It is submitted that thereafter on constitution of the Committee the allotment of the shed was made to respondent No. 5, being a licencee of the Committee and possession holder of the shed prior to the collapse of the shed. Making the above submissions it is prayed that the present appeals be dismissed. 6.      We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length. We have gone through the impugned judgment(s) and order(s) passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court. 6.1     At the outset, it is required to be noted that the appellant is claiming shed/auction platform which is just adjacent to and/or in front of shop No. 27 and/or at any other place. However, the appellant is unable to establish and/or show any specific rules and/or regulations with respect to the allotment of the shed/auction platform and that too, just adjacent and/or in front of shop in which a particular person is carrying on the business. Therefore, in the absence of any specific right in his favour, the appellant could not have prayed for the allotment of shed/auction platform just adjacent to and/or in front of his shop 6.2      At this stage, it is required to be noted that even other persons are allotted the shops/auction platforms at different places. It is also required to be noted that number of persons doing business is more than the availability of auction platforms. 6.3      At this stage, it is also required to be noted that as such pursuant to orders passed by this Court on 06.05.2016 and 05.08.2016, petitioner – appellant made the representation. The “Mr. Patwalia, learned senior counsel states that there are certain other platforms which are available. If that is so, Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 may consider whether one such platform can be allotted to the petitioner or not. Petitioner is entitled to make a representation in this behalf within one week. List the matter in the month of August, 2016.” “It is stated by Mr. P. S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, that platform No. 13 is available. Learned counsel for the respondents submits that the matter is pending consideration and shall be decided within a period of four weeks. Even the representation was permitted to be made to consider on the statement made by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that there are certain other platforms which are available and to that, this Court observed that if that is so, respondent Nos. 2 to 4 may consider whether one such platform can be allotted to the appellant or not. That thereafter, a representation was made by the appellant which has been dealt with and rejected by the Committee by a detailed order which is selfexplanatory. 6.4      In the representation/order, it is specifically mentioned that earlier the shed collapsed on 10.06.2007 and thereafter, the shed was reconstructed in the year 2009 and a policy decision was taken pursuant to the directions issued by the Secretary, Agriculture, that at the first instance, all those allottees, who were allotted sheds for working prior to collapse of sheds on 10.06.2007 were entitled to be allotted shed/space as they existed on the date when the shed collapsed. Thereafter, the allotment has been made as per the principles and guidelines regarding allotment of auction platforms as directed by the Secretary. The guidelines are as “1.      At the first instance, all those allottees, who were allotted sheds for working prior to collapse of shed on 10.06.2007 will be allotted sheds/spaces as they exited as on the date when the shed collapsed. 2.       In case after that, there are more spaces available, those spaces shall be advertised and fresh applications from the bonafide license holders as on the date of inviting the applications or those licensees whose licenses are due for renewal and are pending for renewal with the competent authority as on date of calling applications shall be called, after giving due notice of at least 20 days. Once that is done and in case legally bonafide applications are more than the number of available space, draw of lots will be held in the presence of Chairman, Market Committee, Joint Secretary, Agricultural Marketing Board and applicants who desire to be present. Based on draw of lots further allotment of sites/working spaces shall be made. 3.      These directives shall be followed till such time the Government makes a new rule under the Act and gives new guidelines. Further keeping in view my finding in this case, I am of the considered opinion that any allotment which has been made to other than the erstwhile allottees who were sitting and doing their business as on 10.06.2007 is not just and valid and needs to be set aside. I direct the Market Committee to issue notice for cancellation of allotted site/shed to those allotees who were not allottees as on 10.06.2007 and after giving them due opportunity of being heard, may pass appropriate orders keeping in view the principle which I have laid down in this order." 6.5     That thereafter, the allotments have been made in accordance with the guidelines/principles laid down by the Secretary, Agriculture. Under the circumstances, the appellant is not entitled to any preferential treatment and/or allotment dehors observance of principles and guidelines issued by the Secretary regarding allotment of the auction platforms. The appellant is to be treated at par and equally with other persons doing business in the market and on the auction platform. 6.6     Even as rightly observed by the High Court, to do business in the shop and to carry on business on the auction platform, are both different and distinct. Merely because a person is having a licence and doing business in a particular shop, he is not entitled to the auction platform as a matter of right and that too, in front of and/or adjacent to his shop. No such rule and/or regulation and/or guideline supporting such a claim has been brought to the notice of the High Court or even this Court. 6.7     Now so far as the allotment of the auction platform in favour of respondent No. 5 is concerned, it is required to be noted that according to the Market Committee and respondent No. 5, respondent No. 5 has been holding the licence and doing business since 1970, whereas the appellant herein got the licence on 16.07.2007. It appears that at the relevant time when the allotment of the newly constructed shed was made, the licence of respondent No. 5 was not renewed and/or not valid due to non-renewal and the case for grant of licence was pending for consideration in the office of the Committee, which was granted in the month of February, 2010. Thereafter, the shed has been allotted in favour of respondent No. 5 being a licencee of the Market Committee and being in possession of the shed prior to collapse of the shed. All these aspects in detail have been considered by the Market Committee while deciding the representation. 7.      In view of the above and for the reasons stated above and in absence of any specific rule/regulation to the contrary and when the allotment of the sheds is made as per the principles/guidelines of the Secretary, Agriculture, reproduced hereinabove, and in absence of any specific rule in favour of appellant(s), right to claim the allotment just in front of his shop and/or adjacent to the same and when the allotment in favour of respondent No. 5 is made as per the policy and guidelines, both the learned Single Judge and Division Bench of the High Court have rightly held against the appellant and have rightly dismissed the writ petition(s) and appeal(s). We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High 8.      In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeals lack merit and the same deserve to be dismissed and are accordingly dismissed. No costs.
1.             Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Pune (for short the Tribunal), the Appellant Insurance Company preferred this On 15th May 2010, Sakharam Gaikwad was riding the motorcycle bearing No. MH-14/BD-9975 and deceased Ganesh was a pillion rider on said motorcycle. At the time of incident, Sakharam was crossing Mumbai-Pune road for going towards Kamshet. At the relevant time, the Respondent No.1 drove his rickshaw bearing No. MH-43/C-1989 in rash, excessive and negligent manner and thereby dashed to the motorcycle. Because of dash, Sakharam and deceased fell down on road, sustained multiple injuries. Deceased Ganesh sustained head injury. Ganesh died while taking treatment. The offence was registered against the Respondent No.1 rickshaw driver. 3.             The Claimants filed Claim Petition for getting compensation before the Tribunal. The Tribunal has passed judgment and order, it is under challenge. It is contention of learned Counsel for the Appellant that the Respondent No.1 drove the offending rickshaw outside the jurisdiction and thereby violated the terms and conditions of the permit. Therefore, the Appellant is not liable to pay any compensation to the Claimants. 4.             The permit to ply offending rikshaw was for Thane district only. The incident had happened outside Thane district. 5.             The learned Counsel further submits that the Claimant No.1-wife of deceased Ganesh remarried after the death of Ganesh. Hence, she is not entitled for the compensation and income of deceased is considered on higher side. Hence, requested to allow the 6.             It is contention of learned Counsel for the Respondent- Claimants that the offending rickshaw had permit to drive the rickshaw. No witness is examined by the Appellant to prove that there was breach of terms and conditions of permit before the Tribunal. 7.             The learned Counsel further submits that, when Ganesh died, at that time, the Claimant No.1 was widow and thereafter she filed Claim Petition for getting compensation. At the time of death of her husband, she was 19 years old only. Hence her remarriage cannot be a ground to deny compensation to her. The learned Counsel further submits that deceased was getting Rs.10,000/- per month from doing the welding work and from agricultural land. But the Tribunal has considered only Rs.5,000/- per month. Hence, requested to dismiss the Appeal. 8.             I have heard both learned Counsel. Perused judgment and order passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (for short the Tribunal).         The         Tribunal has awarded       compensation               of 9.             While dealing with issue of breach of permit, the Tribunal has observed that it is settled position that breach of terms and conditions of policy are quite different than the breach of terms and conditions of permit issued by the RTO Authority. The permit was issued for the purpose of plying the rickshaw and giving the service within the District Thane. However, it does not preclude the Opponent No.1 to carry the rickshaw out of the jurisdiction of District Thane. I do not find any infirmity in it. In my view the Appellant’s have not examined any witness to prove that taking offending rickshaw outside the jurisdiction of Thane District was breach of terms of permit, and it amount’s to breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. Hence, I do not see merit in the contention of learned Counsel for appellant that there was breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. 10.            In respect of, issue of remarriage of Claimant No.1, in my view, it appears from record that at the time of death of her husband, she was 19 years old. Thereafter, she filed a Claim Petition for getting compensation, during pendency of the Claim petition she re-married. One cannot expect that for getting compensation of deceased husband, the widow has to remain widow for life time or till getting compensation. Considering her age, and at the time of accident, she was wife of deceased, is sufficient ground that she is entitled for the compensation. Moreover after death of husband remarriage can not be a taboo to get a compensation. Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act states about who can file Application for Compensation. “Section 166. - Application for Compensation – 1) An application for compensation arising out of an accident of the nature specified in sub-section (1) of section 165 may be made - (a) by the person who has sustained the injury; or (b) by the owner of the property; or (c) where death has resulted from the accident, by all or any of the legal representatives of the deceased; or ------” This section provides that by all or any legal representative of deceased can file application for compensation. The Claimant No. 1 was wife of deceased at the time of accident being legal representative she filed application for compensation, which is legal. 11.            In respect of income of deceased, it has come on record that the deceased was doing fabrication work and he was also getting income from agricultural field, and                         he was getting income at Rs.10,000/- per month. Considering the evidence on record, the Tribunal has considered Rs.5,000/-per month as monthly income of deceased. I do not find any infirmity in it. In my view, no evidence was produced on record in respect income from fabrication work. The income from agricultural work can be considered as supervisory income. Hence, notional income considered by the Tribunal is proper. 12.            It     is     contention         of     learned           Counsel         for       the Respondents/Claimants                 that     the     Tribunal          has     not      awarded consortium amount, amount for funeral expenses and loss of estate. 13.            It is contention of learned Counsel for the Appellant that the Claimants have not preferred Appeal for enhancement of compensation. They are not entitled for any enhancement without any Appeal. In my view Section 168 of Motor Vehicles Act states about just compensation. The consortium amount is being awarded to the legal heirs of deceased on the basis of parental consortium, spousal consortium and filial consortium. The Claimants are entitled for consortium amount. Hence, I am considering the consortium amount. As per the view of Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Magma General Insurance Co. Ltd V/s. Nanu Ram1, each Claimant is entitled Rs.40,000/- as consortium amount. There are three Claimants. So they are entitled for Rs.1,20,000/- as consortium and Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses and Rs.15,000/- for loss of estate. Total comes to 14.             The Tribunal has awarded amount of Rs.70,000/- for funeral expenses, loss of love and affection and consortium. If this amount is deducted from amount considered by this Court, it comes to Rs.80,000/-. The Claimants are entitled for Rs.80,000/-. 15.             In view of above, I pass following order. i.              Appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs. ii.             The Claimants are entitled for Rs.80,000/- as additional amount @ 7.5% per annum from 1 October 2017 till realization of the amount. iii.            The Appellant is directed to deposit the additional amount along with accrued interest thereon within four weeks, after iv.            The Claimants are permitted to withdraw the additional amount along with accrued interest thereon. v.             The statutory amount be transmitted to the Tribunal. Parties are at liberty to withdraw it as per rule. vi.            All pending Civil Applications, if any, are disposed of.
appointment        was   under       the  pension         scheme. Thereafter, he joined services as a lecturer in the Sardar Patel University with effect from 04.10.1979. He was appointed as a ‘Reader’ through open selection by direct recruitment with effect from 28.06.1984. He was confirmed in service with effect from 28.09.1986.         It is his case that since the appointment was made after 01.04.1982 on the post of reader, his services has been counted under the GPF        scheme.     He      retired   from      service            on 3. Mr.Jayraj Chauhan learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that it is no longer in doubt that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of pension as per the Government Resolution dated 15.10.1984 and the subsequent notifications. He would rely on a decision in case of State of Gujarat and Ors. v. Ashwinkumar Ramniklal Jani rendered in LPA No.219 of 2017 by which, in the case of the petitioners, the Division Bench dismissed the appeal of the State holding that the petitioner was entitled to the benefits of pension, confirming the decision of the coordinate bench of this Court rendered in Special Civil Application No.15316 of 2015 dated 4. He would submit that after the date of retirement, he was entitled to a gratuity of Rs.10 lakhs.                 This was pursuant to a notification dated 24.05.2010, by which, the gratuity amount was enhanced to Rs.10 lakhs         from    Rs.3,50,000/-.       Consequential amendments made in sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the Payment of Gratuity Act.        A resolution dated 19.07.2014 was passed by the State extending the benefit of availability of gratuity of Rs.10 lakhs given to CPF beneficiaries effective from the date of amendment i.e. 24.05.2010. 5. Ms.Surbhi Bhati learned AGP for the State would submit that reading the appointment order of the petitioner with the Sardar Patel university would indicate that the petitioner was governed by the CPF scheme and therefore not entitled to the gratuity. 6. Considering the submissions made by the learned advocates for the respective parties, the following facts would indicate that the petitioner is entitled to an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- as gratuity pursuant to the       amended  notification     with     effect           from 24.05.2010 which became part of the Act, by which, the ceiling of gratuity was raised to Rs.10 lakhs. Admittedly, from the pay slip of the Sardar Patel University of June 2013, preceding the petitioner’s retirement indicates that GPF was deducted from the salary of the petitioner.      Admittedly therefore the petitioner was governed by the GPF scheme. That all was not in doubt in view of the Division Bench affirming the decision of the learned Single Judge in the petition filed by the petitioner as referred to herein above. 7. Even otherwise, as held by the Division Bench of this Court in Civil Application No.3918 of 2019 in F/LPA No.28476 of 2019, the Division Bench dismissed the appeal of the State upholding the order of the coordinate     bench  in     Special  Civil     Application Nos.7746       of   2014    with      7747   of    2014         dated 23.12.2016, where the Court considered the aspect of payment of gratuity of Rs.10 lakhs and held as “1. Both the petitions raise identical questions of facts and law, and therefore, they are being decided by a common order. 2. The facts for the purpose of adjudication are drawn from Special Civil Application No. 7746 of 2014 which is as under :- 2.1.       The    petitioner       was   serving         in        Shri H.K.Commerce College, affiliated to Gujarat University and he retired from service on 14 June, 2011. He had not opted for pension and continued under the CPF Scheme. The petitioner had desired the benefit of Government Resolution dated 13.4.2009 which enhanced the amount of gratuity to Rs.10.00 Lacs. As the respondent had not paid the amount of Rs.10.00 Lacs (Rupees Ten Lacs only) towards gratuity, it is say of the petitioner that till date, the respondents have not sent any reply to the petitioner nor they have paid the remaining amount of gratuity at par with other GPF holders. Therefore, the petitioner has approached this Court with the following reliefs :- (B) to declare that the action of the respondents in not paying the entire amount of Rs.10 Lacs towards gratuity to the petitioner is arbitrary and bad in law and therefore be pleased to issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ,k order or direction quashing and setting aside the action of the respondents in not paying full gratuity to the petitioner and further be pleased to direct the respondents to pay remaining amount of gratuity to the petitioner forthwith along with 12% interest per annum. (c) Pending admission, hearing and final disposal of this petition, the respondents be directed to pay the remaining amount of gratuity along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum. (d)     to award the cost of this petition. (e) to grant any other and further relief/s as may be deemed fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case. 3. Mr.Jairaj Chauhan, learned advocate appearing for the petitioners has submitted that to both the petitioners, the principal amount of gratuity has already paid on 10.10.2014 . He has urged that Rs. 3.50 Lacs (Rupees Three Lacs Fifty thousand only ) paid on 14.9.2011 and the remaining amount of Rs.6.50 Lacs (Rupees Six Lacs Fifty Thousand only) has been paid on 10.10.2014. Therefore, the court needs to pass necessary directions for the interest part only. 4. This Court has heard learned AGP Ms.Asmita Patel who has fairly submitted the Court may pass appropriate order considering the decision rendered in case of H.Gangahanume Gowda Vs. Karnataka Agro          Industries     Corporation        Ltd. reported in (2003) 3 SCC 40. The Apex Court in the said authority has decided the interest on delayed payment of gratuity. It is also held that the same is mandatory and not discretionary. When it is not the case of the respondent that the delay in the payment of gratuity was due to the fault of the employee and that it had obtained permission in writing from the controlling authority for the delayed payment on that ground, the respondent had been directed to pay interest @ 10% on the amount of gratuity to which the appellant is entitled from the date it became payable till the date of payment of the gratuity amount. 5.Considering the submission of both the sides and bearing in mind the ratio sought to be relied upon by learned AGP , the amount of gratuity has already paid on 14.9.2011 to the tune of Rs.3.50 Lacs and the remaining amount Rs. 6.50 Lacs was paid on 10.10.2014 as petitioner had retired on 14.6.2011. 6. The Apex Court in the above referred decision has held that the grant of gratuity well within time mandatory and not discretionary wherein the Apex Court has held that :- “9. It is clear from what is extracted above from the order of learned Single Judge that interest on delayed payment of gratuity was denied only on the ground that there was doubt whether the appellant was entitled to gratuity, cash equivalent to leave etc., in view of divergent opinion of the courts during the pendency of enquiry. The learned Single Judge having held that the appellant was entitled for payment of gratuity was not right in denying the interest on the delayed payment of gratuity having due regard to Section 7(3A) of the Act. It was not the case of the respondent that the delay in the payment of gratuity was due to the fault of the employee and that it had obtained permission in writing from the controlling authority for the delayed payment on that ground.As noticed above, there is a clear mandate in the provisions of Section 7 to the employer for payment of gratuity within time and to pay interest on the delayed payment of gratuity. There is also provision to recover the amount of gratuity with compound interest in case amount of gratuity payable was not paid by the employer in terms of Section 8 of the Act. Since the employer did not satisfy the mandatory requirements of the proviso to Section 7(3A), no discretion was left to deny the interest to the appellant on belated payment of gratuity. Unfortunately, the Division Bench of the High Court, having found that the appellant was entitled for interest, declined to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge as regards the claim of interest on delayed payment of gratuity only on the ground that the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge could not be said to be arbitrary. In the light of what is stated above, the learned Single Judge could not refuse the grant of interest exercising discretion as against the mandatory provisions contained in Section 7 of the Act. The Division Bench, in our opinion, committed an error in assuming that the learned Single Judge could exercise the discretion in the matter of awarding interest and that such a discretion exercised was not arbitrary. 10. In the light of the facts stated and for the reasons aforementioned, the impugned order cannot be sustained. Consequently, it is set aside. The respondent is directed to pay interest @ 10% on the amount of gratuity to which the appellant is entitled from the date it became payable till the date of payment of the gratuity amount. The appeal is allowed accordingly with cost quantified at Rs. 6.      Adverting to the facts herein, this Court notices that the Government Resolution has been passed by the State on 11-13/4/09 wherein the limit of gratuity was raised to Rs.10 Lacs. The facts remains that the entire sum had become due to the petitioner who retired on 14.06.2011. For no fault of the petitioners, the entire amount of gratuity had not been paid well within the time period and it had been paid in two parts i.e. Rs.3.50 Lakhs on 14.09.2011 and remaining amount of Rs.6.50 Lakhs on 10.10.2014. Hence, for the late payment of Rs.6.50 Lakhs, there is no jurisdiction and the petitioners have made out their case to that extent. This Court is therefore of the opinion that respondent is required to be directed to pay simple interest @ 9% on the amount of gratuity paid late i.e. Rs.6.00 Lacs to which the petitioner was entitled from the date it become payable till the date of payment of the gratuity amount, i.e. from 14.09.2011 to 7. With the above observations and directions, these petitions stand disposed of.” 8. Accordingly the case of the petitioner is covered by the decision reproduced herein above. 9. The petitioner retired in the year 2013 for no fault of his. Mr.Jayraj Chauhan would rely on the following decisions in support of his claim that the petitioner is entitled to interest on the delayed payment of gratuity. (I)     In case of D.D.Tiwari (D) Thr. Lrs vs Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam reported in (2014) 8 (II) In case of Union of India v. M.S.Abdulla reported in (2006) 6 SCC 455 (III) In case of Vijay L. Mehrotra v. State of U.P. & Others reported in (2001) 9 SCC 687 (IV) In case of Union of India and Another v. M.C. Desai and Others reported in (1996) 11 (V)     In    case of H.    Gangahanume       Gowda              v. Karnataka Agro Industries Corpn. Ltd. reported in (2003) 3 SCC 40 (VI) In case of Y.K.Singla v. Punjab National Bank and Others reported in (2003) 3 SCC 472 10. The respondents are directed to pay to the petitioner the amount of gratuity of Rs.10 lakhs within a period of 10 weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order. Since the petitioner superannuated on 14.06.2013 and the amount of gratuity has been wrongfully withheld by the respondents, the petitioner shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 9% from the date of his superannuation till the date of actual payment. 11. The petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms.
1.  Feeling  aggrieved   and   dissatisfied with    the  impugned judgment and order dated 03.07.2019 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Tax Case Appeal No.429 of 2019, by which the High Court has dismissed the said appeal preferred by the revenue and has confirmed the order dated 04.04.2013 passed by the learned Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the learned ITAT) in ITA No.2244/Mds/2012, the revenue has preferred the present appeal. 2.  The facts leading to the present appeal in nutshell are as 2.1 The Assessing Officer (hereinafter referred to as the AO) passed an assessment order under Section 143 (3) of the Income Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) for the assessment year (AY) 2008­09 vide assessment order dated 30.12.2010. The Commissioner of Income Tax initiated revision proceeding under Section 263 of the Act to revise the assessment order passed by the learned Assessing Officer and issued a notice to the assessee ­ respondent herein on 01.02.2012. The assessee – respondent herein filed written submissions on 07.03.2012 and 12.03.2012. That the learned Commissioner passed an order under Section 263 of the Act on 26.03.2012 holding that the Assessing Officer had failed to make relevant and necessary enquiries and to make correct assessment of income after due application of mind and thus the assessment order made under Section 143 (3) of the Act was held to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. The learned Commissioner set aside the assessment order with a direction to Assessing Officer to make necessary enquiries on the aspects mentioned in the order under Section 263. The order passed by the learned Commissioner in exercise of powers under Section 263 of the Act was challenged by the assessee – respondent herein before the learned ITAT. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the order passed under Section 263 of the Act was dispatched by the office of the Commissioner on 28.03.2012. 2.2 The assessee – respondent herein filed an appeal before the learned ITAT on 29.11.2012 submitting that it had come to know about the revision order only when he received notice dated 06.08.2012 under Section 143 (2) read with Section 263 of the Act from the office of the Assessing Officer. Thereafter, the respondent had requested the Assessing Officer to furnish the copy of the order passed by the learned Commissioner which was supplied to him on 29.11.2012. Before the learned ITAT, it was the case on behalf of the assessee – respondent herein that the order passed by the learned Commissioner was beyond the period of limitation prescribed/mentioned under Section 263 (2) of the Act. Vide order dated 04.04.2013 the learned ITAT accepted the contention on behalf of the assessee – respondent herein and allowed the appeal filed by the assessee by holding that the revision order passed by the learned Commissioner was passed beyond the period of limitation. 2.3 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the learned ITAT quashing and setting aside the revisional order passed by learned Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act and holding that the order passed by the learned Commissioner was beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 263 (2) of the Act, the revenue – appellant herein preferred appeal before the High Court, raising the following substantial question of law:­ circumstances of the case, the case, the Tribunal had applied its mind and was right in holding that the revision order of the Commissioner of Income Tax under section 263 dated 26.3.2012 revising the assessment order dated 31.12.2010 is barred by limitation provided under section 263(2) by assuming that the last date for passing the assessment order is 31.3.2012 and on the 2.4 By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has dismissed the said appeal and has confirmed the order passed by learned ITAT holding that the order passed by the learned Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act was barred by limitation. The High Court held that the date on which the order was received by the assessee – respondent herein is the relevant date for the purpose of determining the period of limitation under Section 263 (2) of the Act. 2.5 Feeling   aggrieved   and   dissatisfied with   the   impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, the revenue – appellant herein has preferred the present appeal. 3.  Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) appearing on behalf of the revenue – appellant has vehemently submitted that the High Court as well as the learned ITAT both have misconstrued and misinterpreted the provision of Section 263, more particularly sub­section (2) of Section 263 of the Act. It is submitted that the High Court has erred in holding that the revision order dated 26.03.2012 passed by the Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act was barred by period of limitation provided under Section 263 (2) of the Act. 3.1 It is submitted that the High Court has materially erred in holding that the order passed under Section 263 is barred by limitation provided under Section 263 (2) on the ground that order under Section 263 was served on the assessee – respondent herein on 29.11.2012 which was after the expiry of two years from the end of the financial year in which the order was sought to be revised. 3.2 It is vehemently submitted by learned ASG that sub­section (2) of Section 263 of the Act provides that no order shall be ‘made’ under sub­section (1) of Section 263 after the expiry of two years from the end of the concerned financial year and the relevant date in the present case to pass the order under Section 263 would be 31.03.2012. It is submitted that in the present case the order in fact was passed on 26.03.2012 and in fact dispatched on 28.03.2012. It is submitted that therefore the order passed by the learned Commissioner under Section 263 was within the period of limitation prescribed under Section 263 (2) of the Act. 3.3 Shri R. Sivaraman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent – assessee relying upon para 15 of the counter affidavit has submitted that as such the order passed by the learned Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act has been acted upon before it was set aside by learned ITAT and thereafter a fresh assessment order has been passed by the Assessing Officer. It is submitted that therefore as such the issue involved in the present appeal has become academic. 4.  We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length. Though it is the case on behalf of the respondent – assessee that by now the issue involved in the present appeal has become academic, considering the fact that the question of law raised in the present appeal is the pure question of law and therefore we are inclined to decide the said question of law. 4.1 The short question of law which is posed for consideration before this court is, whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court and the learned ITAT are right in holding that the order passed by the learned Commissioner passed under Section 263 was barred by period of limitation provided under Section 263 (2) of the Act? Whether the High Court is right in holding that the relevant date for the purpose of considering the period of limitation under Section 263(2) of the IT Act would be the date on which the order passed under Section 263 by the learned Commissioner is 4.2 While deciding the aforesaid issues and question of law, Section 263 (2) of the Income Tax Act, which is relevant for our consideration is required to be referred to, which reads “(2) No order shall be made under sub­section (1) after the expiry of two years from the end of the financial year in which the order sought to be revised was passed.” 4.3 On a fair reading of sub­section (2) of Section 263 it can be seen that as mandated by sub­section (2) of Section 263 no order under Section 263 of the Act shall be “made” after the expiry of two years from the end of the financial year in which the order sought to be revised was passed. Therefore the word used is “made” and not the order “received” by the assessee. Even the word “dispatch” is not mentioned in Section 263 (2). Therefore, once it is established that the order under Section 263 was made/passed within the period of two years from the end of the financial year in which the order sought to be revised was passed, such an order cannot be said to be beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 263 (2) of the Act. Receipt of the order passed under Section 263 by the assessee has no relevance for the purpose of counting the period of limitation provided under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act. In the present case, the order was made/passed by the learned Commissioner on 26.03.2012 and according to the department it was dispatched on 28.03.2012. The relevant last date for the purpose of passing the order under Section 263 considering the fact that the assessment was for the financial year 2008­09 would be 31.03.2012 and the order might have been received as per the case of the assessee – respondent herein on 29.11.2012. However as observed hereinabove, the date on which the order under Section 263 has been received by the assessee is not relevant for the purpose of calculating/considering the period of limitation provided under Section 263 (2) of the Act. Therefore the High Court as such has misconstrued and has misinterpreted the provision of sub­section (2) of Section 263 of the Act. If the interpretation made by the High Court and the learned ITAT is accepted in that case it will be violating the provision of Section 263 (2) of the Act and to add something which is not there in the section. As observed hereinabove, the word used is “made” and not the “receipt of the order”. As per the cardinal principle of law the provision of the statue/act is to be read as it is and nothing is to be added or taken away from the provision of the statue. Therefore, the High Court has erred in holding that the order under Section 263 of the Act passed by the learned Commissioner was barred by period of limitation, as provided under sub­section (2) of Section 263 of the Act. 5.   In view of the above and for the reasons stated above the question of law framed is answered in favour of the revenue – appellant and against the assessee – respondent herein and it is held that the order passed by the learned Commissioner under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act was within the period of limitation prescribed under sub­section (2) of Section 263 of the Act. The present appeal is allowed accordingly. No costs.
CM APPL. 36737/2019 (Delay of 44 days in filing appeal) 1.      By this application, the appellant seeks condonation of 44 days’ delay in filing the appeal. 2.      For the reasons stated in the application, delay of 44 days in filing the appeal is condoned. 1.      The appellants, who are the widowed daughter-in-law                      and grand-daughter of the respondents, have filed the petition under Section 19 of the Family Court Act, 1984 against the order dated 3 rd May, 2019 deferring their claim for interim maintenance in a petition under Section 19 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as The Act, 1956). 2.     The facts in brief are that appellant no.1 Smt. Laxmi got married to Sh. Prakash son of the respondents on 3 rd December, 2011 according to Hindu Customs and Rites and one daughter appellant No.2 was born from their wed lock on 1st October, 2012. Unfortunately, Sh. Prakash expired on 14th December, 2013 and since the next day, appellant No.1 along with her daughter shifted to her parental home. According to the respondents, she neither returned nor did she remain in contact with the respondents, but filed a petition for maintenance after four years i.e on 23rd February, 2018. 3.     The appellant in her application for interim maintenance had asserted that she was not well educated and had no source of income to maintain herself or the daughter. She is totally dependent upon her old age ailing parents for her day to day needs. The respondent No.1/ father-in-law is an educated person employed in MTNL department and is duty bound to take care of the daughter-in-law and the grand-daughter.             However, the respondents have intentionally and deliberately neglected them by not paying even a penny towards their maintenance. It was claimed that not only is respondent No.1 getting his regular salary but is also earning about ₹20,000/- per month from rent and his total monthly earnings are about ₹55000/- to ₹65000/-. Accordingly, she claimed interim maintenance in the sum of ₹30,000/- per month till the disposal of the main petition. 4.     The respondents on the other hand, had asserted that the appellants are not entitled to any maintenance under Section 19 of the Act since there was no estate left behind by the deceased. The respondent No.1 neither has any coparcenary property nor any income there from and the petitioners are not entitled to maintenance under the Act. It was claimed that as per the knowledge of the respondents, appellant No.1 was doing a private job in a factory in Gandhi Nagar and earning about ₹9,000/- to ₹10,000/- per month. She also has a share in her ancestral property in a village. 5.      Ld. Principal Judge, Family Court in the impugned order, observed that the appellant had failed to disclose about any estate left behind by her husband with the respondents from which the appellants could claim maintenance. The application was accordingly dismissed. Aggrieved, the present appeal has been filed. 6.      The main ground of challenge is that the widowed daughter-in-law and grand-daughter are entitled to claim maintenance from the father-in-law even if the property is self acquired by the parents-in-law/ grand-parents. It is claimed that the facts have not been appreciated in the right perspective and the maintenance has been wrongly denied to the appellants. 7.      Learned counsel on behalf of the appellants stated that the appellant No.1 has undergone surgery and is not capable of working and taking care of herself. She was being supported and maintained by her parents who have some rental income from some part of the residential house which has been given on rent. However, her father has expired and her mother is an illiterate woman who has no source of income. She also has younger sisters and a younger brother who are all being maintained by the mother from the income being generated solely from the rent. It was vehemently argued that being the daughter-in-law and the grand-daughter, the appellants are entitled to maintenance from the respondents. 8.      During the course of arguments it was mentioned that respondent No.1 has expired about more than a year back. The respondent No.2, who is the mother-in-law, has a married daughter who is staying with her on account of her matrimonial discord. Sh. Prakash, the deceased son was a widower at the time of his marriage with petitioner No.1 and had a daughter from the first marriage who also is living with respondent No.2 and is being maintained by her. It was submitted that the respondents have some rental income from the part of their house which has been rented out, but the rental income is not sufficient for the respondents to meet the requirements of herself as well as of dependent members. It was further stated that Sh. Prakash was an e-rickshaw driver and had no estate whatsoever which was inherited by the respondents. There is no property of Sh. Prakash which devolved upon the respondents from which the appellants can claim a right to be maintained. 10.    The petitioners have claimed maintenance under the Act 1956. Section 19 of the Act provides for maintenance to a widowed daughter-in- law. It reads as under: 19. Maintenance of widowed daughter-in-law.— (1) A Hindu wife, whether married before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be entitled to be maintained after the death of her husband by her father-in-law: Provided and to the extent that she is unable to maintain herself out of her own earnings or other property or, where she has no property of her own, is unable to obtain maintenance— (a) from the estate of her husband or her father or mother, or (b) from her son or daughter, if any, or his or her estate. (2) Any obligation under sub-section (1) shall not be enforceable if the father-in-law has not the means to do so from any coparcenary property in his possession out of which the daughter-in-law has not obtained any share, and any such obligation shall cease on the re- marriage of the daughter-in-law. 11.    The daughter-in-law can claim maintenance from her father-in-law provided he has inherited some estate of her husband. The appellant has failed to disclose any estate of her husband having devolved upon the respondents. Not only this, the respondent No.1 father-in-law has already expired.    Now only respondent No.2 mother-in-law survives and the appellants cannot as a matter of right, claim any maintenance from her. 12.    Section 22 of the Act provides for maintenance of dependents of the deceased by the heirs of the deceased, but this is subject to the condition that they having inherited the estate from the deceased. 13.    As already noted above, no estate has been inherited either by the mother or the sister of the deceased husband of the appellant No.1 from which any maintenance can be claimed by the appellants. There is no infirmity in the impugned order of the learned Family Judge. The appeal is hereby dismissed. 14.    Order be uploaded on the website of this court.

Appellant-New India Assurance Company Ltd. is the insurer of   the   Truck    bearing       Registration            No.HR-38H-5545.     On 24.12.2007, the truck was dashed by a rash and negligent trolley which resulted in death of driver Raghuvir Singh. For the accident aforesaid Sojat City PS Case No.389/2007 was registered on 25.12.2007. The police came and with the help of JCB Crane dragged the damaged truck to the soiled portion of the road and the truck was left there under seizure of the police. Copy of the FIR is Ex-8 on this record. 2.    On 26.12.2007, driver Pawan Kumar alongwith others was driving the car bearing Registration No.RJ-21CA-0783. The FIR of Sojat City PS Case No.390/2007 registered on 27.12.2007 would reveal that Pawan Kumar was rash and negligent while driving the car on 26.12.2007 and dashed with the said truck from behind the truck, resulting in death of the Pawan Kumar and injury to others. After investigation of Sojat City PS Case No.390/2007, the police found that the accident was due to rash and negligent driving of Pawan Kumar. The car was insured with Respondent No.12- (3 of 6)              [CMA-2423/2012] Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. The legal representatives of victim Pawan Kumar brought Claim Case No.364 of 2011 (78/2008) before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Upper 3.    The Tribunal found that the said accident was due to negligent parking of the truck without any flash light for guidance of other moving vehicles or any other sign showing stationed truck. In the result, the Tribunal fixed 50% liability on the truck and 50% contributory negligence on the deceased. 4.    The appellant is aggrieved by the impugned judgment dated 01.05.2012 passed in Claim Case No.78 of 2008/364 of 2011. 5.    Mr. Praveen Jain, learned counsel for the appellant contends that without verifying the actual state of affairs, the driver and owner alongwith insurer of the truck were impleaded as party in the claim petition alongwith owner and insurer of the car. Without verifying the fact that driver Raghuvir Singh had already died two days back in the accident of the said truck. Learned counsel contends that the Tribunal wrongly fixed 50% negligence of already damaged truck rather the accident was due to 100% negligence of car driver. Moreover, the truck was under the seizure of the police, hence it could not have been held that the parking of the truck was result of negligence of driver or owner of the vehicle. The owner of the truck Jaswant Singh was examined as NAW-2 in the claim case and he is specific that the crane brought by the police had dragged and shifted the truck to the soilly road by the side of the main pitch road. The police was not made party deliberately otherwise the entire matter would have surface before (4 of 6)                 [CMA-2423/2012] 6.    While admitting this appeal for hearing, this Court issued notice to Respondent No.12 only on the question whether the appellant-Assurance Company can be held liable to pay the compensation or it is the respondent No.12-Oriental Insurance Company,    which    should      bear      the      liability of  payment     of 7.    Mr. Rishipal Agarwal, learned counsel for the respondent No.12 contends that the Tribunal has relied on the judgment of Raj Rani and Ors. Vs. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd., reported in 2009 (13) SCC 654 corresponding to 2008 ACJ (SC) 1617 wherein the fact of the case was that the truck was parked on the middle of the road without any flash light and the vehicle which caused death was coming from behind the truck and dashed against the truck. Learned counsel further relies on the judgment of Hon’ble Karnataka High Court in Misc. First Vs. Pushpa & Ors., in support of his contention on the point of contributory negligence. Reliance has been placed on National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Mrs. Sunita Yadav and Ors., reported in 2007 (1) TAC 992 (Raj.). 8.    In my view, none of the aforesaid cases are helping respondent No.12 in the facts and circumstances of this case. In Raj Rani (supra) case the driver of the truck had parked the truck on the mid of the road without any flash light or indicator again the driver of the lorry had parked half on the Tar road (pitch road). Likewise, in National Insurance Company Ltd. (supra) the truck was parked by the driver without any reflectors, blinkers (5 of 6)              [CMA-2423/2012] or indicators. Against the said truck a jeep with a moderate speed had collided. In the present case, admittedly the parking of the truck was not due to negligence of the driver or owner of the truck. The driver had already died in the accident two days ago. The damaged truck was dragged with the help of JCB crane to the side of the road on the soiled portion. These facts are not disputed. The claimant of this case unaware of the aforesaid factual position or by suppressing the aforesaid factual positions impleaded the dead driver Raguvir Singh as party to the claim petition. Moreover, the truck was in the seizure of the police and no police official was impleaded as party to the claim petition. The police investigation report available on the record reveals that the accident was result of sole negligence of the driver of the car, who was rash and negligent at the time of accident. The informant of the case is eye- witness of the occurrence. 9.    Therefore, in my view, the learned Tribunal on wrong in appreciation of the facts as well as the law while holding that 50% of the contribution to the accident was of the truck. There is no evidence that the truck was parked at the public place by its driver or the owner rather definite evidence is that the police crane had dragged the truck to the soiled portion of the road leaving the pitch road completely free for movement and the car had dashed going on the soiled portion of the road without any perceivable obstruction from any other vehicle. Therefore, the accident was result of the rash and negligence driving of the car. 10.   Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside to the extent that the Tribunal has fixed the liability to pay compensation on respondent Nos.2 and 3 i.e. owner and insurer of the truck. In (6 of 6)                 [CMA-2423/2012] fact, the liability was against the owner and insurer of car during use whereof the accident took place. Therefore, the exoneration of respondent Nos.4, 5, 6 and 7 by the Tribunal is also not sustainable in law. Accordingly, the same is set aside and it is ordered that the entire liability to pay compensation goes against the owner and insurer of the car. Since the car was insured with respondent No.12 it is liable to pay entire compensation payable to the claimants. If there would be any violation of the terms and conditions of policy i.e. the driver of the car being without any license to drive the vehicle or without any proper license, respondent No.12 would be competent to recover from the owner of the car in a separately instituted proceeding after making payment to the claimant. 11.    It has been informed that the appellant has already paid Rs.5,10,500/- to the claimant. Therefore, the appellant would be entitled to be reimbursed by respondent No.12. Respondent No.12 shall pay the aforesaid amount to the appellant alongwith interest paid by the appellant to the claimant on the aforesaid amount. Exercise be completed within three months to avoid 12% interest till recovery. 12. Accordingly, this appeal stands allowed to the aforesaid extent.
1.     Petitioners claim to be engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing and/or sale of telecommunications related products worldwide. According to petitioners, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) invited bids for planning, supply, installation and commissioning of IMPCS 20/30 Combo Network (Phase V) vide tender No.: MM/CMTS/032006/000301 dated 22.03.2006 and B&CCS (Billing and Customer Care System including DR) and COTS Solution, which were part of overall IMPCS 20/30 network (Phase V) solution designed by petitioners, were to be delivered to the BSNL as per tender specifications and requirement. For this purpose, petitioners entered into PACCHNHW09032002 RUA dated 20.03.2009 with the respondent. 2.     During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that Clause 4.4 of the Agreement clearly stipulated that time is of the essence under the agreement and the respondent is obligated to follow the project time line and ensure that no delay is there in supply and implementation; Clause 4.5 of Agreement stipulated that the respondent was to provide (one) year Operation and Maintenance support; Clauses 4.6 and 10.3 of the Agreements read with Clause 1.2.1 stipulated that respondent was required to provide three years’ 7X24 warranty services from the date of commissioning of the complete network in the service area. It was also submitted that respondent was responsible for bearing all the expenses for repair and replacement of the supplied solution and provide the same free of charge to the petitioners during the subsistence of the warranty period. It was also stipulated in both the Agreements that in case BSNL imposes any penalty on the petitioners due to delay in restoration/replacement/fixing of the fault with B&CCS and COTS solution, the respondent shall pay the complete penalty imposed and also if the respondent has to get the defects remedied from a third party, that shall be at complete risk and expense of the respondent. 3.     Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that based on the aforesaid agreements and assurances, the petitioners issued four purchase orders to respondent for hardware implementation, integration of B&CCS and other components, integration of new element with billing system and performance tuning with expanded billing system, disaster recovery and business continuity system, application, software, drives, modem, printer, web based application with customizable OUI for data analysis and COTS package. According to petitioners, the aforesaid work was commissioned after a delay on 25.06.2012 and was valid till 24.06.2013 and the associated warranted for complete solution/products supplied was valid till 24.06.2015. 4.     Learned counsel next submitted that during the subsistence of warranty period under the said agreements, BSNL raised several issues with regard to solution and products supplied by the respondent, however, respondent in direct breach of its contractual obligation did not rectify/resolve certain issues. Several e-mails and communications were made by the petitioners to the respondent during that one year requesting respondent to fix the issues and admittedly, in a few of the communications, respondent acknowledged the pending issues and assured the petitioners that all the issues will be resolved/rectified. In order to rectify the defects and due to inaction of respondent, petitioners engaged a Third-Party Vendor and in terms of the agreements, the third party vendor was wholly at the risk and cost of respondent and the same was informed to the respondent. 5.     According to counsel for petitioners, thereafter meetings were held between petitioners and respondent on 26.10.2016; 06.12.2016; 15.11.2018 and 27.11.2018 wherein respondent always assured the petitioners that their team will check the claims of petitioners and revert, however, respondent failed to perform its contractual obligation. 6.     Learned counsel further submitted that due to non-resolution/ rectification of open/pending issues with the Servers and Storage, BSNL imposed penalty amounting to INR3,62,46,055 on petitioners for the period 2015-2017, which accrued only due to voluntary inaction, breach of warranty terms and non-adherence to contractual obligations by the respondent. Additionally, BSNL has withheld Huawei's Bank Guarantee (BG) amounting to INR7,72,23,487, which may be encashed by BSNL due to inaction of respondent. 7.     Further, during subsistence of the Agreements respondent did not avail technical support from ORACLE and petitioners got to know about it only when it demanded the complete payment of Technical Support charges from December 2010 onwards from the petitioners before providing any further service, which respondent is solely liable to pay. 8.     Learned counsel for petitioners next submitted that due to respondent’s inaction to resolve the issues with BSNL and upon failure of discussions between the parties, petitioners sent Legal Notice dated 21.12.2018 to respondent to come up with resolution plan within seven days. Though the said letter was replied by the respondent vide communication dated 03.01.2019, however, it only stated that the detailed response shall follow, which respondent never did. Thereafter, petitioners were constrained to send legal notice dated 14.03.2019 to respondent invoking arbitration under Clause 18 of the Agreements and proposed name of Justice (Retd.) R.C. Chopra as the sole arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes and called upon the respondent to consent to the same. However, the said communication was not replied to and therefore, this petition has been filed seeking appointment of sole Arbitrator by this 9.     On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent submitted that the disputes between the parties are not at all arbitrable and hence, the present petition deserves outright rejection. Learned counsel submitted that the claims raised by the petitioners are highly time barred, which purportedly pertain to Agreements dated 20.03.2009, according to which respondent were to provide warranty services for three years and the cause of action is not a continuous cause of action and also that the maximum period of three years under the limitation expired in December, 2017 and, therefore, the present petition deserves to be rejected on the point of limitation alone. Learned counsel submitted that even if it is assumed that the purported e-mails were exchanged between the parties, yet the e-mail was written by the respondent in the year 2016 and notice invoking arbitration by the petitioners is of the year 2019 and thereby, this petition fails on 10.    Reliance was placed upon Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision dated 06.03.2021 in BSNL Vs. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738 to submit that merely by exchange of letters and discussions, period of limitation for issuing of notice invoking arbitration, shall not be extended and also that Section 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on settlement discussions. Reliance was also placed upon another decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Geo Miller SCC 643 to submit that petition under Section 11(6) of the Act was rejected as the claims were hopelessly time barred. 11.    It was submitted by learned counsel for respondent that by filing this petition, petitioners are trying to revive the dead claims and there is no continuing cause of action in the present case. Reliance was also placed upon Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decisions in Balkrishna Sansthan&Ors. AIR 1959 SC 798 and M. Siddique Vs. Mahant Suresh Das 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1440 in support of above submissions. 12.    Learned counsel next submitted that neither Agreement was executed nor any breaches were committed within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present petition under the provisions of Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. It was next submitted that neither of the parties work for gain at New Delhi; the cause of action has not accrued at New Delhi; the agreement was not executed in New Delhi but in Gurgaon and none of the payments has been received in New Delhi, moreover no breached were committed within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate this petition under Section 11 of the Act. 13.    Learned counsel further submitted that the arbitration clause contained in Para-18.2.1 notes that the place of arbitration shall be New Delhi and this would not confer any jurisdiction upon this Court to entertain this petition. It was submitted that seat and venue are two different legal issues and place of arbitration cannot give the status of the juridical seat. 14.    Learned counsel submitted that all disputes between the parties were settled in a meeting dated 21.12.2015, whereunder petitioners and respondent had agreed to liquidate the damages at 6.5% of total Purchase Order value and thereby, differential amount of INR 16,151,717.51 was paid by respondent to petitioners on 11.03.2016, which fact is concealed by the petitioners. 15.    To refute petitioners’ claim that the defects were got rectified by a third party on 19.05.2017 at the risk and cost of respondent, learned counsel placed reliance upon decision of a Division Bench of this Court in Ancient Infratech Vs. NBCC wherein it was held that the cause of action has to have a cut-off date of determination irrespective of letters demanding completion of work and therefore, rectification of work by a third party cannot renew the period of limitation. 16.    Reliance was also placed upon Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in Sundaram Finance Vs. NoorjhanBiwi 2003 (16) SCC 1 to submit that where there was a breach in payment of instalments, the limitation ran from the date of the first default of payment. 17.    Learned counsel further submitted that both the Agreements in question are independent of each other and cannot be bound for the purpose of Section 11 of the Act. With regard to claims raised by the petitioners, learned counsel submitted that these are false, baseless and without any merit. Hence, dismissal of the present petition is sought. 18.    In rebuttal, learned counsel for petitioners submitted that respondent’s plea seeking dismissal of the present petition on the ground of limitation is to be rejected as even though the warranty period got over by 24.06.2015, thereafter, petitioners and respondent have been in continuous exchange of e-mails and holding meetings on regular intervals from 2015 till 2018. It is only when on 27.11.2018 that the respondent for the first time declined to rectify the pending issues, the petitioners sent a legal notice on 21.12.2018 and finally, invoked arbitration on 14.03.2019. Hence, the claims raised by petitioners cannot be treated as “dead wood” as stated by respondent. Reliance was placed upon decisions in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738 and Vidya Drolia Vs. Durga Trading Corpn. (2021) 2 SCC 1. 19.    The arguments advanced by both the sides were heard at length and the material placed on record as well as decisions relied upon have been perused. 20.    The foremost question which is first required to be answered is whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the present petition. 21.    In reply to the present petition, it is averred by the respondent that since one of the parties to the Agreements is not an Indian national, therefore, disputes, if any, shall be governed under the international arbitration as defined under Section 2(f) of the Act and also that the provisions of Section 11(4) of the Act make it clear that in case where international commercial arbitration has to take place, only the Hon’ble Supreme Court shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator. However, during the course of hearing, no submission was made in this regard and therefore, this Court has not gone into this 22.    Relevantly, it is not disputed that the Cooperation Agreement dated 20.03.2009 in question contains the arbitration clause, which reads 18.2.1 The Agreement will be governed by the laws of India All disputes. controversies or claims arising out of or in connection with or in relation to this Contract or itsnegotiation, performance, breach, existence or validity, whether contractual or tortuous, shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and conducted by a single Arbitrator to be appointed by the Parties by mutual consent. The cost of the arbitration shall be shared by the Parties. The place of the arbitration shall be New Delhi, India. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English language. The award of the arbitration shall be final and binding against the Parties hereto. 23.    The Hon’ble Supreme Court in BGS SGS SOMA JV Vs. NHPC, “82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it arbitration clause as being the “venue” of the arbitration proceedings, the expression “arbitration proceedings” would make it clear that the “venue” is really the “seat” of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. This language has to be contrasted with language such as “tribunals are to meet or have witnesses, experts or the parties” where only hearings are to take place in the “venue”, which may lead to the conclusion, other things being equal, that the venue so stated is not the convenient place of meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings “shall be held” at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there being no other significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a “venue” and not the “seat” of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a “seat” of the arbitral proceedings. In an international context, if a supranational body of rules is to govern the arbitration, this would further be an indicia that “the venue”, so stated, would be the seat of the arbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would be replaced by the Arbitration Act, 1996 as applying to the “stated venue”, which arbitration.” 24.    Hence, the contention of respondent that seat and venue are two different legal issues and place of arbitration cannot give the status of the juridical seat, is liable to be rejected and this Court is well within its jurisdiction to entertain this petition. 25.    Another question, which is raised in the present petition is that the claims raised by the petitioners are ex facie highly time barred. To seek dismissal of present petition on this ground, respondent has placed reliance upon various decisions and this Court has gone through the 26.    In Geo Miller Vs. Chairman (Supra) relied upon by the respondent, the final bill was handed over on 10.08.1989; three years period ended on 10.08.1992; notice invoking arbitration was sent in 2002 and petition under Section 11 was filed in the year 2003 and thereby, the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that there was inordinate delay of 14 years and upheld the decision passed by High Court of Rajasthan dismissing petition under Section 11 of the Act. 27.     The decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Balkrishna Savalram Pujari (Supra)andM. Siddique (Supra) relied upon by the respondent, are distinguishable on facts and is of no assistance to the case in hand. 28.     In Vidya Drolia (Supra) relied upon by the petitioners, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has dealt with the scope of judicial review under Sections 8 and 11 of the Act. 29.     The Hon’ble Supreme Court in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (India) (P) Ltd. (Supra)has extensively dealt with the issue of determining limitation period in filing a petition under Section 11 of the Act as well as issue whether a Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Act is obligated to appoint an Arbitrator where the claims are ex-facie time barred. 30.     With regard to first issue i.e. determining the period of limitation in filing petition under Section 11 of the Act, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network(Supra)has held as under:- “15. It is now fairly well-settled that the limitation for filing an application under Section 11 would arise upon the failure to make the appointment of the arbitrator within a period of 30 days from issuance of the notice invoking arbitration. In other words, an application under Section 11 can be filed only after a notice of arbitration in respect of the particular claim(s)/dispute(s) to be referred to arbitration [as contemplated by Section 21 of the Act] is made, and there is failure to make the appointment. 16. The period of limitation for filing a petition seeking appointment of an arbitrator(s) cannot be confused or conflated with the period of limitation applicable to the substantive claims made in the underlying commercial contract. The period of limitation for such claims is prescribed under various Articles of the Limitation Act, 1963. The limitation for deciding the underlying substantive disputes is necessarily distinct from that of filing an application for appointment of an arbitrator. This position was recognised even under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. Reference may be made to the     judgment      of     this    Court       in J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa Mining Corpn. Ltd. [J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa Mining Corpn. Ltd., (2008) 2 SCC 444 : (2008) 1 SCC (Civ) 582] wherein it was held that Section 37(3) of the 1940 Act provides that for the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration is deemed to have commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other party, a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Para 26 of this judgment reads as follows : (SCC p. claims were in time as on that date. notice      invoking      arbitration. position clear.” 19. The reasoning in all these judgments seems to be that since an application under Section 11 is to be filed in a court of law, and since no specific Article of the Limitation Act, 1963 applies, the residual Article would become applicable. The effect being that the period of limitation to file an application under Section 11 is 3 years from the date of refusal to appoint the arbitrator, or on expiry of 30 days, whichever is earlier.” 31.    Applying the afore-noted observations to the case in hand, this Court finds that in the present case, the agreement in question contains an arbitration clause. For resolution of disputes with regard to work order in question, petitioners first sent Legal Notice dated 21.12.2018 to respondent calling upon to provide a resolution plan within seven days, which was replied by the respondent vide its communication dated 03.01.2019 stating therein the respondent was under the process of reviewing the allegations and claims raised by the petitioners and a details response shall be shared shortly. Thereafter, petitioners sent a legal notice dated 14.03.2019 to respondent invoking arbitration wherein name of Justice (Retd.) R.C.Chopra was proposed for appointment as Arbitrator, which was not replied to. The period of limitation of three years will be counted from the expiry of refusal to reply to appointment of Arbitrator within 30 days of invoking arbitration by notice, which in this case shall be 13.04.2019. The present petition was filed before this Court on 24.05.2019 and in this manner, there is no delay in filing the present petition. 32.    On the second question raised in the present petition by the respondent that the claims raised by the petitioners are ex facie highly time barred, reliance was again placed by respondent upon decision in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (Supra)to submit that the period of limitation in issuing the notice of arbitration would not get extended by mere exchange of letters or mere settlement discussions and the case of petitioners is a deadwood. Relevantly, in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (Supra), the Hon’ble Supreme Court had dealt with a case where the notice invoking arbitration was issued after 5½ years of rejection of claims and there was no averment either in the notice of arbitration or the petition filed under Section 11 of the Act or before the Supreme Court any intervening facts which would have extended the limitation period. However, in the said case the Hon’ble Supreme Court on this question “47. It is only in the very limited category of cases, where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make the reference. However, if there is even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the disputes to arbitration, otherwise it would encroach upon what is essentially a matter to be determined by the tribunal.” 33.    In view of afore-noted observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court, this court has once again tested the minute details of this case to find out whether the claims raised by the petitioners are stale and ex facie time barred and liable to be rejected. 34.    Pertinently, with regard to Agreement dated 20.03.2009, work was commissioned after a delay on 25.06.2012 and respondent was required to give one year maintenance and three years operation warranty and so, the Operation and Maintenance period was valid till 24.06.2013 and the warranty was valid till 24.06.2015. With regard to issues raised by their client-BSNL, petitioners had written several e-mails dated 1.09.2015, 08.03.2016, 27.04.2016 and 26.10.2016 to respondent for rectification and resolution of pending issues and a few of them were replied by the respondent vide e-mail dated 28.12.2015, 07.01.2016, 03.02.2016. Besides, both sides held meetings on 15.11.2018 and 27.11.2018. The first legal notice was sent on 21.12.2018, which was replied by the respondent 03.01.2019 stating that the detailed response shall be given and thereafter, on 14.03.2019 notice invoking arbitration was sent by the petitioners nominating its Arbitrator. However, since the said notice was not replied to within 30 days, petitioners filed the present petition on 24.05.2019. Without going into the details of these e-mails and minutes of meeting held between the parties, this Court finds that there has been continuous cause of action and persistent demand raised on the part of petitioner and thereby, the claims raised cannot be said to be decayed. 35.    So far as plea of respondent that the claims raised by respondent that all disputes stood already settled in terms recorded in the Minutes of Meeting dated 21.12.2015 or that there are two distinct agreements which cannot be consolidated          or that the defects which were got rectified by a third party at the risk and cost of respondent, are questions of claims which shall be considered and decided by the learned 36.    Pertinently, execution of Cooperation Agreement dated 20.03.2009 between the parties; existence of arbitration Clause-18.2 therein and invocation of arbitration by virtue of notice dated 14.03.2019 is not disputed. Also, terms of Clause -18.2 the disputes have to be referred to a 37.    Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and Mr. Justice G.S. Sistani (Retd.) Mobile: 9871300034 is appointed the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute between the parties. 38.    The fee of the learned Arbitrator shall be governed by the Fourth Schedule of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 39.    The learned Arbitrator shall ensure compliance of Section 12 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before commencing the 40.    The present petition and pending application, if any, are accordingly disposed of.
2.  The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 24th April, 2019 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the NCDRC) in Revision Petition No. 897 of 2018, whereby the NCDRC while allowing the said Revision Petition, has set aside the order passed by the State Commission and has confirmed the order passed by the District Forum. Dr. 3.  The short facts giving rise to the present appeal are that Mr. Pradeep Kumar, the husband of the respondent herein (original complainant) had taken/purchased a life insurance policy under the Jeevan Suraksha Yojana on 14.04.2021 from the appellant-Life Insurance Corporation, under which a sum of Rs. 3,75,000/- was assured by the corporation, and in case of death by accident an additional sum of Rs. 3,75,000/- was also assured. The insurance premium of the said policy was to be paid six monthly. The next premium was due to be paid by the said insured Pradeep Kumar on 14th October, 2011. However, he committed a default. On 06.03.2012, the said Pradeep Kumar i.e. the husband of the complainant met with an accident and succumbed to the injuries on 21.03.2012. In the meantime, he deposited the due premium of October,   2011  on,   09.03.2012   for reviving  the   policy. The complainant after the death of her husband filed a claim before the appellant-Corporation. The appellant paid a sum of Rs. 3,75,000/- to the complainant, however, did not pay the additional amount of Rs. 3,75,000/- towards the Accident claim benefit. The complainant, therefore, approached the District Forum by filing a complaint seeking the said amount towards the Accident claim benefit. The said complaint was resisted by the Life Insurance Corporation contending, inter alia, that the day when the husband of the complainant met with an accident, the said policy had already lapsed on account of non-payment of the due premium. 4.  The District Forum placing reliance upon the Ready reckoner issued by the appellant-Corporation, allowed the said claim of the respondent vide its judgment and order dated 14.10.2013. The appellant-Corporation being aggrieved by the same preferred an appeal before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The State Commission allowed the said appeal and set aside the said order passed by the District Forum. The aggrieved complainant preferred a Revision Petition being no. 897 of 2008 under Section 21(B) of the Consumer Protection Act (hereinafter referred to as the said Act), before the NCDRC challenging the order passed by the State Commission. The NCDRC vide the impugned judgment dated 24.04.2019 allowed the said Revision Petition of the respondent and set aside the order passed by the State Commission. Hence, the present Appeal has been filed by the appellant-Corporation. 5.   The learned counsel appearing for the appellant-Corporation placing heavy reliance on the condition no. 11 of the policy submitted that the Accident claim benefit was payable only if the policy was in force on the date of accident, however, in the instant case, the policy had already lapsed in October, 2011 and the husband of the respondent-complainant had sought to pay the premium on 09.03.2012, i.e. three days after the occurrence of accident on 06.03.2012. According to him, even the appellant- Corporation was not informed about the said accident when the policy was sought to be revived on 09.03.2012. He has placed reliance on the judgments of this court in case of Vikram Greentech (I) Ltd. & Anr vs New India Assurance Co. Ltd (2009) 5 SCC 599 and in case of Life Insurance Corporation of India Vs. Jaya Chandel (2008) 3 SCC 382 to submit that there is a requirement of good faith on the part of the insured in the contract of insurance. 6.   However, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent- complainant submitted that the said terms and conditions of the policy were not brought to the notice of the insured i.e. the husband of the complainant, and that the complainant was entitled to the Accident claim benefit as per the Ready reckoner. He further submitted that the husband of the complainant had made payment of premium on 09.03.2012 along with the late fee charges and, therefore, the policy had stood revived before the death of the complainant’s husband. He also placed reliance on LIC vs. Jaya Chandel (supra) to submit that since the insurance company had issued the renewal premium receipt on 09.03.2012, it was required to be construed that the policy which had already lapsed due to non-payment of premium on time, had stood revived. 7.   In order to appreciate the rival contentions raised by the learned counsels for the parties, apt would be to reproduce the relevant conditions of the policy in question. Relevant condition “3. Revival of Discontinued Policies: If the policy has lapsed, it may be revived during the life time of the Life Assured, but within a period of five years, from the due date of the first unpaid premium and before the date of Maturity, on submission of proof of continued incurability to the satisfaction of the corporation and the payment of all the arrears of premium together with interest compounding half yearly at such rates as may be fixed by the Corporation from time to time. The Corporation, reserves the rights to accept or accept with modified terms or decline the revival of Discontinued Policy. The revival of a Discontinued Policy shall take effect only after the same is a approved by the Corporation and is specifically communicated to the proposer/Life (a) If, after at least 3 full years premiums have been paid in respect of this Policy, any subsequent premiums be not duly paid, this Policy shall not be wholly void, but shall subsist as a Paid-up Value which shall be payable in case of death/Matyrly and shall depend on the number of years for which premiums have been paid and shall be greater of a sum that bears the same ratio to the Maturity Sum Assured as the number of premiums actually paid shall bear to the total number of premiums originally stipulated in the Policy. The surrender value as per para 7 below assuming that the policy has been surrendered on the date of death/Matyruty, as the case may be. 11. Accident Benefit (If opted for): If at any time when this policy is in force for the full sum assured or reduced sum assured in case of partial surrender of the policy, the life assured, before the expiry of the policy term or the policy anniversary on which the age nearer birthday of the Life Assured is 70 years, whichever is earlier, is involved in an accident resulting in either permanent disability as hereinafter defined or death and the same is proved to the satisfaction of the Corporation, the Corporation (b) Death of the Life Assured: to pay an additional sum equal to the Accident Benefit Sum Assured under this Policy, if the life assured shall sustain and bodily injury resulting solely and directly from the accident caused by outward, violent and visible means and such injury shall within 180 days of its occurrence solely, directly and independently of all other causes result in the death of the life assured.” 8.    Now, so far as the facts of this case are concerned, it is not disputed that the husband of the complainant had taken the life insurance policy on 14.04.2011, that the next premium had fallen due on 14.10.2011 but was not paid by him, that the husband of the complainant met with an accident on 06.03.2012, that thereafter the premium was paid on 09.03.2012 and that he expired on 21.03.2012. It is also not disputed that at the time of making payment of premium on 09.03.2012, it was not disclosed by the complainant or her husband to the appellant-Corporation about the accident which had taken placed on 06.03.2012. The said conduct on the part of the complainant and her husband in not disclosing about the accident to the corporation not only amounted to suppression of material fact and lacked bona fides but smacked of their mala fide intention, and therefore, the Accident benefit claim of the complainant was liable to be rejected on the said ground alone. It is well settled legal position that in a contract of insurance there is a requirement of Uberrima fides i.e. good faith on the part of the assured. The Supreme Court in case of Vikram SCC 599, while dealing with the contract of insurance held as “16.    An insurance contract, is a species of commercial transactions and must be construed like any other contract to its own terms and by itself. In a contract of insurance, there is requirement of uberrima fides i.e. good faith on the part of the insured. Except that, in other respects, there is no difference between a contract of insurance and any other contract. 17.        The four essentials of a contract of insurance are: (I) the definition of the risk, (ii) the duration of the risk, (iii) the premium, and (iv) the amount of insurance. Since upon issuance of the insurance policy, the insurer undertakes to indemnify the loss suffered by the insured on account of the risks covered by the insurance policy, its terms have to be strictly construed to determine the extent of liability of the insurer. 18.        The endeavour of the court must always be to interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the parties. The court while construing the terms of policy is not expected to venture into extra liberalism that may result in rewriting the contract of substituting the terms which were not intended by the parties. The insured cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the insurance policy. (General Assurance Society Ltd. v. Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sony Cheriyan AIR 1999 SC 3252 and United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. 9.  From the afore-stated legal position, it is clear that the terms of insurance policy have to be strictly construed, and it is not permissible to rewrite the contract while interpreting the terms of the Policy. In the instant case, condition no. 11 of the Policy clearly stipulated that the policy has to be in force when the accident takes place. In the instant case, the policy had lapsed on 14.10.2011 and was not in force on the date of accident i.e. on 06.03.2012. It was sought to be revived on 09.03.2012 after the accident in question, and that too without disclosing the fact of accident which had taken place on 06.03.2012. Thus, apart from the fact that the respondent- complainant had not come with clean hands to claim the add on/extra Accident benefit of the policy, the policy in question being not in force on the date of accident as per the condition no. 11 of the policy, the claim for extra Accident benefit was rightly rejected by the appellant-Corporation. Since, clause 3 of the said terms and conditions of the policy permitted the renewal of        discontinued policy, the appellant-Corporation had revived the policy of the respondent-complainant by accepting the payment of premium after the due date and paid Rs. 3,75,000/- as assured under the policy, nonetheless for the Accident benefit, the policy had to be in force for the full sum assured on the date of accident as per the said condition no. 11. The said Accident benefit could have been claimed and availed of only if the accident had taken place subsequent to the renewal of the policy. The policy in the instant case was lying in a lapsed condition since 14 th October, 2011 and, therefore, was not in force as on 06.03.2012, resultantly, the claim over Accident benefit was not payable to the respondent as per the conditions of the contract of insurance. 10. The Court, therefore, is of the opinion that the impugned order passed by the NCDRC setting aside the order passed by the Commission and reviving the order passed by the District Forum was highly erroneous and liable to be set aside. 11. In the aforesaid premises, the present appeal is allowed and the impugned order passed by the NCDRC is set aside. The claim of the  respondent    towards     Accident    benefit      stands        rejected accordingly. Pending applications, if any, are disposed of.
The present appeal impugnes the judgment dated 16.12.2017, passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in Criminal Appeal No. 3/2017, whereby conviction of the appellant-Amar Chand under Section 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), vide judgment dated 20.10.2016, passed by the Special Judge, District Kullu, Himachal Pradesh in Sessions Trial No.27 of 2015, has been upheld. The appellant has been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years, pay fine of Rs. 1,00,000/-, and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 1 year. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are inclined to allow the appeal by giving the appellant benefit of doubt. It has come on record that the site plan/spot map, marked Ex. PW-5/D, which was statedly prepared at the spot where recovery was made on 03.05.2015, is wrong and Head Constable Hitesh Kumar (PW-4), in his crossexamination, has accepted that in the site plan, the river has been shown on the left-side going towards Manikaran. However, this is incorrect as the river should have been shown on the right-side and the hill-side should have been shown on the left-side. This would indicate that the location of the police vehicle used for Nakabandi has been wrongly indicated. Similarly, the place where the appellant had allegedly thrown the rucksack (Pithu bag) has been wrongly Head Constable Sunil Kumar (PW-5), the Investigating Officer, has deposed in his examination-in-chief as having prepared the spot/site plan, marked as Ex.PW-5/D. In his cross examination, he had to accept that the site plan is incorrect as the river is shown on the right-side while going from Bhuntar towards Manikaran. He has stated that this was a mistake, albiet a miss so fundamental which does dent and cast grave doubt on the prosecution version on the place and manner of recovery. This apart, the prosecution has not been able to show and prove the scribe/author of the arrest memo, marked as Ex.PW-4/A, and the personal body search memo (Jamatalashi), marked as Ex. PW-4/B.Head Constable Hitesh Kumar (PW-4) has accepted that he had not put his signatures on the arrest memo, marked as Ex.PW-4/A, and the personal body search memo (Jamatalashi), marked as Ex. PW-4/B, though his name is mentioned therein as an attesting witness. The second attesting witness, Head Constable Janesh/Jinesh Kumar did not depose as a witness. Janesh Kumar has also not signed the arrest memo, marked as Ex.PW-4/A, and the personal body search memo, marked as Ex. PW-4/B as an attesting witness. Head Constable Hitesh Kumar (PW-4) professed that the arrest memo, marked as Ex.PW-4/A, was prepared by Head Constable Sunil Kumar (PW-5). However, Head Constable-Sunil Kumar (PW-5) proffered that he is not the scribe/author of the arrest memo, marked as Ex.PW-4/A, and the personal body search memo (Jamatalashi), marked as Ex. PW-4/B. The appellant had taken the plea and defence that he was arrested from the bus stand at Hathithan on 03.02.2015 at about 6:30 p.m., while he was waiting to board a bus. 4-5 women were also present there. One unclaimed bag was found under a bench by two Police officers who were present there. Opening the said bag, charas was found. Thereupon, the appellant has been falsely implicated. There were no public witnesses and as per the version of the Police, the public witnesses, in spite of efforts made for 20-30 minutes, could not be found, the location being uninhabited. In view of the aforesaid lacunae and gaps in the case of the prosecution, when taken collectively and together, we feel, that the conviction of the appellant under Section 20 of the NDPS Act cannot be sustained. The appellant must be given benefit of doubt. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the appellant’s conviction and sentence under section 20 of the NDPS Act is set aside. The appellant shall be released forthwith unless he is detained in accordance with law for any other offence. In case the appellant has deposited the fine, the same shall be refunded to him.
The FIR was lodged by the 2nd respondent alleging that one Tulasa Ram – accused No.1 was due a sum of Rs.66,00,000/- (Rupees Sixty Six Lakhs only) and he had lodged the FIR against the accused No.1 before the Halasoor Gate Police Station. Such being the case, when the respondent No.2 and accused No.1 met at Prakash Café as to settle the matter, at that point of time, the accused No.1 and petitioner – accused No.2 herein, abused the 2nd respondent in filthy language and gave threat to his life and also assaulted him with their hands. 2.    The police after investigation, submitted the chargesheet against the petitioner and others for the offences punishable under Section 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of 3.    The learned Magistrate after accepting the chargesheet, took cognizance for the aforesaid offences and issued summons to the petitioner – accused. Taking exception to the same, this petition is filed. 4.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the alleged incident had taken place 45 days prior to lodging of the FIR.        However, there is no plausible explanation offered in the FIR for the delay in lodging the FIR.     He further submits that in the absence of any statement of the employees or customers in the Prakash Café, recorded under Section 161 of IPC, the chargesheet filed by the police in the absence of any corroborative material is without any substance. 5.    Learned HCGP appearing for the State would submit that the chargesheet material clearly discloses the commission of the aforesaid offences alleged against the petitioner and the same does not warrant any interference by this Court. 6.    I have considered the submissions made by learned counsel appearing for the parties. 7.    The FIR was lodged alleging that one and half months back the petitioner and other accused abused him in filthy language and assaulted him. However, there is no plausible explanation offered in the impugned FIR for the delay in lodging the FIR. 8.    The Apex Court in the case of State of AP vs. M.Madhusudhan Rao, reported in (2008) 15 SCC 582, at para 30 has held as follows: “30. Time and again, the object and importance of prompt lodging of the first information report has been highlighted. Delay in lodging the first information report, more often than not, results in embellishment and exaggeration, which is a creature of an afterthought.     A delayed report not   only   gets   bereft  of the  advantage     of spontaneity, the danger of the introduction of a coloured version, an exaggerated account of the incident or a concocted story as a result of deliberations and consultations, also creeps in, casting    a   serious   doubt  on   its  veracity. Therefore, it is essential that the delay in lodging    the   report  should  be   satisfactorily explained.” 9.     In the absence of any plausible explanation offered by the 2nd respondent – informant, the FIR lodged against the petitioner – accused is with malice and without any probable cause.       Even otherwise, to constitute the commission of the offence punishable under Section 323 of IPC, the police have not placed any material that the respondent No.2 sustained any simple injuries due to the alleged assault made by the petitioner – accused. 10.   To  constitute   the   commission    of offence punishable under Section 504 and 506 of IPC, the intention of insult must be of such a degree to provoke breach of public peace or commission of any other offence. In the present case, the abusive language alleged to have been used by the petitioner – accused has not caused breach of public peace or commission of any other offences. In view of the same, it would be an abuse of process of law, if the criminal proceedings are allowed to be continued against the petitioners, since the probability of conviction of the petitioner – accused No.2 is remote and bleak. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following: Criminal petition is allowed. C.C.No.20068/2015 pending on the file of I ACMM, Bengaluru City insofar it relates to petitioner – accused No.2 is hereby quashed.
The police after investigation submitted a charge sheet for the offences punishable under Section 498 A read with Section 34 of IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of 2.   The summary of the charge sheet is that the marriage of Accused No.1 and respondent No.2 was solemnized on 08.10.2009 in accordance with islamic customs and tradition and thereafter they resided at the marital home along with other accused. Out of the said wed-lock, a child by name Rehan was born on 04.06.2011 in India. Thereafter accused No.1 and respondent No.2 along with the child went to USA in the month of December-2011. They returned to India in the year 2016 and during their stay in India, respondent No.2 was harassed by accused to bring dowry for the purpose of higher education of accused No.1 in USA. On 08.02.2017 respondent No.2 went back to USA along with the child and later on 10.02.2018 she was sent back forcibly to India. On 28.05.2018 she went to the house of accused Nos.2 to 4. At that point of time, the said accused refused to allow her to enter the house. 3.   Learned Magistrate after taking cognizance of the aforesaid offences issued summons. Taking exception of the same, this petition is filed. 4.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that except omnibus and general allegations there is no specific allegation as against the accused for having demanded dowry or for having assaulted respondent No.2. He further submits that marriage of accused No.1 and respondent No.2 was dissolved on 29.01.2018 by the IOWA Court in USA and also permanent     alimony   of   $50,000      was  paid to respondent No.2. Hence, he submits that the charge sheet filed against the petitioners-accused in the absence    of  any  essential  ingredients  so   as  to constitute   the  commission    of aforesaid   offences alleged against the petitioners-accused is without 5.    Learned counsel appearing for respondent No.2 submits that the order granting divorce by the Court of USA is obtained fraudulently without issuing notice to respondent No.2 and the same has no binding   on   respondent   No.1.  The   charge   sheet material clearly discloses commission of the offences alleged against the accused and the same does not warrant any interference. 6.    I have examined the submissions of the learned counsels for the parties. 7.   It   is  undisputed  that respondent No.2 resided with accused No.1 along with child in USA. The allegation is that respondent No.2 was sent back to   India   forcibly  on   16.02.2018   without    any reasonable cause. It is also undisputed that the marriage of respondent No.2 with accused No.1 was dissolved by the IOWA Court at USA and permanent alimony has    been deposited in the bank account of respondent No.2 which clearly implies that marriage of accused No.1 with respondent No.2 was dissolved and the contention of learned counsel for respondent No.2 that the order of divorce was obtained fraudulently without issuing notice to respondent No.2 cannot be considered in this petition. Hence, the marriage of respondent No.2 having been dissolved with accused No.1, the charge sheet filed against accused is without any substance. In the absence of any essential ingredients so as to constitute the commission of offences alleged against the petitioners-accused, the charge sheet filed is not sustainable. 8.   Even    otherwise,    except  omnibus     and general allegations there are no specific allegations as to how and in what manner each of the accused subjected respondent No.2 to cruelty or assaulted her. Hence, the charge sheet filed on the basis of omnibus and general allegations is also without any substance. The dispute between the parties arises out of martial discord, however, given a criminal texture so as to pressurize   the   petitioners/accused   to   arrive  at 9.   The allegation against accused Nos.2 to 4 subjecting respondent No.2 to cruelty was during her alleged stay in India in 2017. Respondent No.2 returned to India on 10.02.2018 and the FIR was lodged    on    30.05.2018     without   offering    any explanation. Hence, it is implied that the FIR was lodged against accused Nos.2 to 4 with an ulterior motive to wreak vengeance and with revengeful 10.  The probability of the conviction of the petitioners-accused being remote and bleak, it would be abuse of process of law, if the criminal proceeding is allowed to be continued against the petitioners- accused. Accordingly, i pass the following: 1    Criminal petition is allowed. 2.   The      impugned          proceedings    in C.C.No.1426/2018 pending on the file of Addl. Civil Judge & JMFC, Bantwal, D.K., is hereby quashed.

1.    This appeal arises out of an unfortunate dispute between the appellant no.1 - wife and the respondent no.1 - husband over the custody of their minor male child Aaditya Kiran. This appeal takes an exception to the Judgment and order dated 31 st August 2021 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in a petition for habeas corpus filed by the respondent no.1 herein for seeking custody of the minor. 2.    The respondent no.1 and the appellant no.1 were married in New York, United States of America (for short “USA”) on 13 th January 2011. The child was born in USA on 21st January 2016. Thus, the child is a citizen of USA by birth and is holding a USA passport. Unfortunately, the child was diagnosed with hydronephrosis which required surgery. It is the case of the respondent no.1 that as they were not in a position to secure an appointment of a doctor in USA for surgery, it was agreed between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 that the child will undergo surgery at Max Hospital, Saket.     As the child is a citizen of USA, consent for international travel with one legal guardian was executed by and between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 on 4 th February 2019. The consent was recorded in the said document to enable the child to travel with the mother – the appellant no.1 to India. The consent was executed for the period between 5th February 2019 to 26th September 2019. The consent document recorded that the child will be leaving USA on 5 th February 2019 and will be returning back to USA on 26 th September 2019. It was further recorded that any changes to this plan shall be discussed and consented to by both the parents. A certificate dated 17 th September 2019 issued by Dr. Anurag Krishna, Director, Paediatrics and Paediatric Surgery of Max Hospital, Saket, New Delhi records that the child underwent a surgery on 14th March 2019.      It records that he had examined the child on 12 th July 2019 when he found that the child was doing well. Dr. Anurag Krishna has recorded that the child needs to be reviewed 6 to 7 months post-surgery along with a fresh ultrasound and renal scan. 3.    It is the case of the respondent no.1 that at the time of surgery, he flew down to India. After the surgery, he returned to USA for his work. It is brought on record that the respondent no.1 has a status of permanent resident in USA which is valid up to 16 th August 2031. According to the case of the respondent no.1, the appellant no.1 violated the international travel consent by not allowing the minor child to come back to USA by 26 th September 2019. According to the respondent no.1, the appellant no.1 detained the minor in her illegal custody in India. Therefore, the respondent no.1 filed a petition on 30th January 2020 before the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas, USA, which according to the respondent no.1 is the Court of competent jurisdiction. The petition was filed for seeking primary care, control, and custody of the minor on account of his wrongful detention outside USA. On 3rd February 2020, the Circuit Court passed an interim order granting primary care, custody, and control of the minor child to the respondent no.1 and directed the appellant no.1 to return the child to the respondent no.1. In the petition for habeas corpus filed by the respondent no.1 in the High Court, he has stated that though a copy of the said order of the Circuit Court was forwarded to the appellant no.1 by email, she continues to detain the minor child in India.      In the circumstances, the respondent no.1 filed a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana and prayed for a direction to the State of Haryana to secure the release of the minor child from the illegal custody of the present appellants. The appellant nos.2 and 3 are the parents of the appellant no.1 who are residents of Gurgaon in Haryana. At present, the appellant no.1 is staying with them. Various interim orders were passed in the said petition from time to time. The High Court appointed a learned counsel as amicus curiae, who interacted with the appellant no.1 as well as the respondent no.1 on phone/WhatsApp calls with a view to ascertain their respective stands. He also submitted a report. By the impugned Judgment and order, the writ petition filed by the respondent no.1 was allowed. In paragraph 55, the High Court issued following directions: - “(i) respondent No.2 is directed to return to USA along with minor child on or before 30.09.2021; (ii) in case respondent No.2 opts to return to USA, the petitioner shall bear the travel and incidental expenses of respondent No.2 and the minor child for return to and also the expenses for their stay in USA till decision of the custody petition and the petitioner shall not initiate any criminal/contempt proceedings against respondent No.2 for inter (iii) if respondent No.2 fails to comply with aforesaid direction, respondent No.2 shall hand over custody of the minor child and his passport to the petitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other (iv) in case respondent No.2 fails to hand over custody of the minor child and her passport to the petitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other date as may be agreed to by the petitioner, respondent No.1 shall take over the custody and passport of the minor child from respondent No.2 and hand over custody and passport of the minor child to the petitioner on such date as may be agreed to (v) on custody of the minor child and his passport being handed over to the petitioner, the petitioner shall be entitled to take the minor child to USA; (vi) in case passport of the minor child is not handed over to the petitioner or respondent No.1 by respondent No.2 on the ground of loss/damage etc., the petitioner shall be entitled to get the duplicate passport issued from the concerned (vii) on such return of the minor child to USA, either of the parties shall be at liberty to revive the proceedings before US Court for appropriate orders regarding appointment of guardian and grant of custody of the minor child.” 4.     Further directions were issued in paragraphs 57 and 58 by the High Court based on a decision of this Court in the case of Yashita Sahu v. State of Rajasthan1. Paragraphs 57 and 58 read thus:- Sahu's case (supra) it is ordered that till filing of any such application by either of the parties for revival of the proceedings before the US Court and passing of any interim/final order by the US Court of competent jurisdiction on the same, respondent No.2 shall be entitled to visit the child and have his temporary custody from 10:00 a.m. between the petitioner and respondent No.2 if respondent No.2 returns to and stays in USA or make video calls to the minor child for about half respondent No.2 does not return to and stay in USA and in such an eventuality, the petitioner parents/other relatives once in a year. 58. However, nothing in this order shall prevent the parties from adopting any joint parenting plan minor child such as by arranging admission of the minor child in some school with hostel facility and by visiting her during holidays and taking her custody during vacation as may be permitted by the school authorities. It is also further clarified that the observations in the present order have present writ petition and shall not bind any Court involving question of custody or welfare of the child.” 5.    As per the assurance recorded in the order dated 24th September 2021 of this Court, the respondent no.1 has secured a USA visa to the appellant no.1 of the B-2 non-immigrant category. As can be seen from the order dated 24th November 2021, this Court made an attempt to ascertain whether an amicable solution could be found to the dispute. Both sides were directed to submit their suggestions for the amicable resolution of the dispute. However, an amicable resolution of the dispute was not possible. 6.    The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that even after surgery, the child needs constant medical care. She submitted that any lapses could be extremely fatal for the life of the minor. She submitted that the doctor who operated upon the child has advised a very strict care regime for the child. She pointed out that constant monitoring of his health is required.    Even the water intake of the child has to be carefully monitored. She pointed out that even the appellant no.3, the grandmother of the child is taking care of the minor child and there is a family support available as she is residing with her parents.        She pointed out that a detailed affidavit has been filed by the appellant no.1 indicating reasons why in the interest of the child he should be in India till he is 9-10 years old. 7.    Relying upon the material on record, she submitted that even the respondent no.1 constantly wished to settle down in India and therefore, he purchased more and more land in India and especially in Bangalore. The learned counsel pointed out that it was the respondent no.1 who himself selected a pre-school for the child while he was in India in April, 2019. She submitted that the respondent no.1 since the time he got married to the appellant no.1 made plans to move back to India permanently and was planning to construct a farm house and a residential house in Bangalore. She submitted that it was the desire of the respondent no.1 that the appellant no.1 should work in India. Accordingly, property was bought in Bangalore where the mother of the respondent no.1 resides. The learned counsel pointed out that after emails dated 25 th December 2019 and 14th January 2020 were forwarded by the appellant no.1 to return the money to the appellant no.2 taken from him for land purchase in Bangalore, the aforesaid petition was filed by the respondent no.1 in the Court at Arkansas 8.      In the written submissions of the appellants, there are various factors pointed out, such as the temperamental nature of the respondent no.1 and the conduct of the respondent no.1. The learned counsel submitted that this Court has held that principles of autonomy must inure in the individual against non-state persons as well. She submitted that in custody cases, a woman cannot be completely eliminated in the name of the welfare of the child. She urged that the woman cannot be deprived of her rights. She submitted that in any case, the appellant no.1 is the primary/sole caretaker of the child. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur Sandhu v. Harbax Singh Sandhu and Another2, Elizabeth Dinshaw (Mrs.) v. Arvand M. Dinshaw and Another 3 and Nithya Anand Raghavan v. State (NCT of Delhi) and Another4, the learned counsel submitted that there is a statutory presumption in favour of the appellant no.1 under the doctrine of tender years. She submitted that this doctrine has been upheld in the aforesaid three cases and this Court asserted maternal preference as found under Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (the Act of 1956). She submitted that the appellant no.1 is the primary caregiver and therefore, it is in the child’s best interest to retain the custody with the appellant no.1. 9.     The learned counsel submitted that to compel the appellant no.1 who is the primary caregiver to return to USA under the rule of “best interest of child” will amount to an invasion of her fundamental right of autonomy which is a part of the right of privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. By adopting a summary procedure, such invasion on the rights of the appellant no.1 cannot be made. She submitted that the welfare of the child will mean balancing the interests of all in the family of the child. The mother being the primary caregiver must be kept in mind by the Court and her legal rights must be respected and protected by the Court.    She submitted that the appellant no.1 is a fit mother and, in patriarchy, some special care is needed to counter the dominant presence of the father of the child. The learned counsel extensively relied upon an Article by Mr.John Ekelaar under the title “Beyond the welfare principle”. She submitted that the best interest of the child is the primary principle which also means the welfare of each member of the family of the child. She submitted that the matter in patriarchy becomes also a matter of gender rights which is a constitutional issue covered under Article 14 read with Article 15(3) of the Constitution of India.       She submitted that the constitutional provisions recognize that women form a separate category who need to be enabled by the law. 10.    She submitted that the citizenship of a child has nothing to do with the welfare principle.   A child may be a citizen of any country, but if the competent Court finds that it is in the best interest of the child that he is brought up in India, the child should be permitted to stay in India. The learned counsel invited our attention to a decision of this Court in the case of Kanika Goel v. the State of Delhi through Station House Officer and another5 as well as a decision in the case of Prateek Gupta v. Shilpi Gupta and others6. She submitted that in these two cases, though the child was a foreign citizen, it was found to be in the best interest that the child remains in India to continue with the prime caregiver. Her submission is that in this case, the child can continue to be an American citizen and stay in India on the basis of an OCI card. She submitted that eventually, the child can make his own choice at the age of 18. 11.    The learned counsel submitted that the decisions in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) are binding precedents as the same are rendered by the Benches consisting of three Hon’ble Judges.                She submitted that the High Court has completely ignored the binding precedents. She submitted that the learned Judge of the High Court cannot decide the case based on his subjective personal opinion. She submitted that it is necessary that clear and consistent law be followed even in the custody matters and judicial discretion is not used to subvert the evolving 12.    The learned counsel submitted that in this case, a writ of habeas corpus was not maintainable as the custody of the appellant no.1 is not illegal. She pointed out that in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra), directions were issued to the Family Court to complete the hearing of custody matters within a time frame. The learned counsel submitted that in the cases of Yashita (supra) and Lahari Sakhamuri v. Sobhan Kodali7, an exception was made to the rule laid down, in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) as in these two cases, the mothers had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court in USA. 13.    She reiterated that in the name of welfare and interest of the child, the welfare of one of the parents cannot be eliminated altogether. The learned counsel submitted that the appellant no.1 cannot be compelled to go back to USA. Her submission is that if the child is placed in the custody of the respondent no.1 on the ground that the appellant no.1 is not interested in going to USA, the child will be reduced to a chattel. 14.    The learned counsel submitted that to refuse a woman the right of mothering is refusing to acknowledge and respect a very core biological and social identity. She submitted that a custody dispute cannot be decided purely in the facts of each case. She submitted that the law laid down in the case of Nithya (supra) has to be followed as recently done by Bombay High Court in the case of Chandima Janaka Wijesinghe v. Union of India and others in Crl. Writ Petition No. 547 of 2021. 15.    The learned counsel submitted that the issue of medical evaluation of the child requires a detailed hearing. She submitted that the visa granted to the appellant no.1 is only a tourist visa which would entitle her to visit USA only for specific enlisted reasons.       She submitted that the stand of the respondent no.1 of supporting the appellant no.1 for getting the visa is illusory. She pointed out that the respondent no.1, by relying upon alleged legal separation, has contended that he cannot support the application for a grant of a green card to the appellant no.1. The learned counsel also invited our attention to the pleadings in the interlocutory applications filed by the respondent no.1. She submitted that the conduct of the respondent no.1 of making allegations in the applications shows that he is more interested in litigation and winning the battle against the appellant no.1 rather than acting in collaboration with her for the benefit of the child. 16.    The learned counsel further submitted that the Indian medical system is better suited for taking care of the minor son and even the appellant no.3 is a doctor. She submitted that it is not in the interest of the minor son that he is taken to USA. 17.    She submitted that considering the unique facts of the case, the larger Bench decisions of this Court in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) are applicable. She submitted that the said two decisions constitute binding precedents and the cases of Lahiri (supra) and Yashita (supra) are exceptions to the general rule. She submitted that the concept of forum convenience has no place in the Guardianship proceedings. She submitted that this is not a case of abduction of the child as the child was brought to India with the consent of the respondent no.1 for the purposes of medical treatment. Therefore, the learned counsel submitted that the offer given by the respondent no.1 cannot be accepted for the reasons set out in the written submissions.       She submitted that the impugned Judgment is erroneous and illegal which deserves to be set aside. 18.   The learned counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 pointed out that the appellant no.1 has spent more than nine years in USA. After her marriage with the respondent no.1, she has spent eight years in USA. He invited our attention to the consent executed by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 for permitting the child to travel to India between 5 th February 2019 to 26th September, 2019. He submitted that in the light of the increase in cases of international parental child abduction from the USA, the Immigration Authorities in USA do not allow a minor US citizen to leave the country only with one parent without the express consent of the non-travelling parent. He submitted that after the consent document was executed, no changes therein were even discussed between the parties. He submitted that documents on record will show that in terms of the international travel consent form, return tickets of 26 th September, 2019 were also booked. He submitted that in violation of the international travel consent, the appellant no.1 has not sent back the minor son to USA, which amounts to the detention of the minor in her illegal custody in India. 19.   The learned counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 submitted that there is no document produced on record by the appellants to show that the child needs continuous follow-up treatment. 20.   The learned counsel submitted that in terms of the interim order dated 10th June 2020 of the High Court, the respondent no.1 has been interacting regularly with his minor son through video conference and there is a very healthy and deep father and son relationship between them. He stated that he has taken legal advice from a firm specialising in immigration law in USA. He submitted that the respondent no.1 received advice from the said firm that to enable the appellant no.1 and the child to travel to USA, the quickest as well as legally and practically most viable way to get a visa was to get a B-2 non-immigrant visa. 21.   He pointed out that in the visa invitation letter, the respondent no.1 has clarified that he will take care of tour expenses of the appellant no.1, including the round trip, airfare, food, housing, medical insurance in USA. The learned counsel submitted that the order of the High Court is a very balanced order which is consistent with the law laid down by this Court in the cases of Lahiri (supra) and Yashita (supra).        He would, therefore, submit that there is no reason to interfere with the equitable order passed by the High Court. 22.   We have given a careful consideration to the submissions.          The appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 got married on 13 th January 2011 in New York in USA. The minor son was born on 21 st January 2016 and is admittedly a citizen of USA. There is no dispute regarding the appellant no.1 and respondent no.1 signing and executing a consent for travel of the minor to India with one legal guardian. It is necessary to reproduce the said I, Kiran Bhaskar of 321 Division St, Cenerton, AR 72719, United States declare that I am the legal parent/guardian of Aaditya Kiran, male, born certificate registration number 2016001506, issued numbered 546227929, issued on October 14, 2016 at United States, Department of State. My child, Aaditya Kiran, has consent to travel: (February 5th, 2019 to September 26th, 2019), C/o (February 5th, 2019 to September 26th, 2019), C/o, with Vasudha Sethi (my wife, Aaditya’s mother) of States. Vasudha Sethi has an Indian passport numbered J0499893, which was issued on June 8, 2010 at Regional Passport Office, Delhi, India. My child will be leaving the United States on February 5th, 2019 and returning to the United States on September 26th, 2019. Any changes to this plan shall be discussed and consented upon by both parties. Any questions regarding this document may be Signed on this 4th day of February, 2019. 23.  It is not the case of the appellant no.1 that there was even a discussion between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 for modification of the said consent till date. Admittedly, the period of travel mentioned in the consent was not extended by the respondent no.1. The minor son underwent surgery at the hands of Dr. Anurag Krishna on 14 th March 2019.       The certificate dated 17th September 2019 issued by Dr.Anurag Krishna records that he examined the minor on 12 th July, 2019 and he found that the child was doing well.           He has recorded in the certificate that the child needs to be reviewed 6 to 7 months after the surgery along with fresh ultrasound and renal scan. Thus, the surgery has taken place 33 months back. The appellant has not placed on record any medical certificate or opinion of Dr.Anurag Krishna on the present health condition of the child. The appellants have not placed on record any medical certificate of the treating doctor recording that the child needs any further treatment or medical care in India. The respondent no.1 consented for the child travelling to India and remaining in India till 26 th September 2019. The reason for the grant of consent was to enable the minor to undergo surgery in New Delhi. We will have to proceed on the footing that there is no documentary evidence available on record to show that the presence of the child in India for further medical treatment is necessary. 24.    On 3rd February, 2020, the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas, USA passed an ex-parte order which reads thus: “Now on the 3rd day of February, 2020, this matter comes before the Court, and the Court, being well and sufficiently advised finds and orders as follows: 1. The Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter and venue is proper herein. 2. Defendant has removed the parties' minor child to India and remained there without the consent of 3. Defendant has alienated the child from Plaintiff, which is harmful to the child's well-being. 4. Plaintiff is awarded primary care, custody and control of the minor child, Aaditya Kiran pending further orders of the Court. 5. Defendant shall return Aaditya Kiran to Plaintiff immediately. request by either party.” 25.   Firstly, we will deal with the legal submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellants. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants has placed heavy reliance on the decisions of this Court in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra) which are rendered by Benches of three Judges of this Court. With some emphasis, the learned counsel appearing for the appellants had submitted that there is a need to make a departure from the rule of “best interest of the child” or the “welfare principle”.  Her contention is that welfare would mean balancing the interests of all the members of the child’s family. She contended that the mother as the primary caregiver must be kept in mind as a person who has legal rights which must be respected and protected. The learned counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India8 by contending that principles of autonomy must inure against non-state persons as well.      Her submission is that the law regarding custody does not and cannot completely eliminate a woman in the name of child welfare. On this aspect, we must note that in the case of Kanika (supra), this Court has quoted with approval what is held in paragraph 53 of its decision in the case of Prateek Gupta (supra). In paragraph 53 of the decision in the case of Prateek Gupta (supra), it was held that the issue with regard to repatriation of a child has to be addressed not on a consideration of legal rights of the parties but on the sole criteria of the welfare of the child. In paragraph no.34 of its decision, this Court in the case of Kanika (supra), “34. As expounded in the recent decisions of this Court, the issue ought not to be decided on the basis of rights of the parties claiming custody of the minor child but the focus should constantly remain on whether the factum of best interest of the minor child is to return to the native country or otherwise. The fact that the minor child will have better prospects upon return to his/her native country, may be a relevant aspect in a substantive proceeding for grant of custody of the minor child but not decisive to examine the threshold issues in a habeas corpus petition. For the purpose of habeas corpus petition, the Court ought to focus on the obtaining circumstances of the minor child having been removed from the native country and taken to a place to encounter alien environment, language, custom, etc. interfering with his/her overall growth and grooming and whether continuance there will be harmful. This has been the consistent view of this Court as restated in the recent three-Judge Bench decision in Nithya Anand Raghavan [Nithya Anand Raghavan v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2017) 8 SCC 454 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 104] , and the two-Judge Bench decision in Prateek Gupta [Prateek Gupta v. Shilpi is unnecessary to multiply other decisions on the same aspect.” 26.    The learned counsel appearing for the appellant heavily relied upon an article by Mr.John Ekelaar. The article contains some criticism of “the welfare principle”. The author has strongly advocated how the law should be reformulated by getting rid of “welfare” or “best interest” principles. The article is in the realm of the opinion of the learned author. The decision of this Court in the case of Kanika (supra) reiterates the well-settled law that the issue regarding custody of a minor child and the issue of the repatriation of the child to the native country has to be addressed on the sole criteria of the welfare of the minor and not on consideration of the legal rights of the parents.    The principle that the welfare of the minor shall be the predominant consideration and that the rights of the parties to a custody dispute are irrelevant has been consistently followed by this Court. In fact, in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (for short “the 1956 Act”), it is provided that in appointment or declaration of guardian of a minor, the welfare of the minor shall be the paramount consideration.       When a Court decides that it is in the best interest of the minor to remain in the custody of one of the parents, the rights of the other parent are bound to be affected. As provided in clause (a) of Section 6 of the 1956 Act, in the case of a minor boy or girl, the natural guardian is the father, but ordinarily, the custody of a minor who has not completed the age of 5 years shall be with the mother. On a conjoint reading of sub-section (1) of Section 13 read with clause (a) of Section 6 of the 1959 Act, if it is found that the welfare of a minor whose age is more than 5 years requires that his custody should be with the mother, the Court is bound to do so. In the same way, if interest of the minor which is the paramount consideration requires that the custody of a minor child should not be with the mother, the Court will be justified in disturbing the custody of the mother even if the age of the minor is less than five years. In such cases, the rights of the father or the mother, as the case may be, conferred by clause (a) of Section 6 are bound to be affected. Whenever the Court disturbs the custody of one parent, unless there are compelling reasons, the Court will normally provide for visitation rights to the other parent. The reason is that the child needs the company of both parents. The orders for visitation rights are essentially passed for the welfare of minors and for the protection of their right of having the company of both parents. Such orders are not passed only for protecting the rights of the parents.    In view of the settled legal position, the welfare of the minor being the paramount consideration, we cannot act upon the suggestions of Mr.John Ekelaar in his Article. We cannot accept the submission that while applying the welfare principle, the rights of the mother or father need to be protected. The consideration of the well-being and welfare of the child must get precedence over the individual or personal rights of the parents. Whether the Court while dealing with a case like this can compel one of the parents to move from one country to another is a separate issue. We are dealing with the said issue separately. 27.    Each case has to be decided on its own facts and circumstances. Though no hard and fast rule can be laid down, in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra), this Court has laid down the parameters for exercise of the power to issue a writ of habeas corpus under Article 226 of the Constitution of India dealing with cases of minors brought to India from the country of their native. This Court has reiterated that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the minor child and the rights of the parties litigating over the custody issue are irrelevant. After laying down the principles, in the case of Nithya (supra), this Court has clarified that the decision of the Court in each case must depend on the totality of facts and circumstances of the case brought before it.       The factual aspects are required to be tested on the touchstone of the principle of welfare of the minor child.     In the cases of Lahiri (supra) and Yashita (supra), the Benches of this Court consisting of two Judges have not made a departure from the law laid down in the decisions of larger Benches of this Court in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra). The Benches have applied the law laid down by the larger Bench to the facts of the cases before them. It is not necessary for us to discuss in detail the facts of the aforesaid cases. By its very nature, in a custody case, the facts cannot be similar. What is in the welfare of the child depends on several factors. A custody dispute involves human issues which are always complex and complicated. There can never be a straight jacket formula to decide the issue of custody of a minor child as what is in the paramount interest of a minor is always a question of fact. But the parameters for exercise of jurisdiction as laid down in the cases of Nithya (supra) and Kanika (supra) will have to be followed. 28.   Now we turn to the findings recorded by the High Court. The perusal of the impugned judgment shows that the High Court has adverted to the law laid down in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra) apart from other cases. The High Court found that in the facts of the case, summary inquiry deserves to be adopted. The Court noted that the child has spent more than three years in USA and two and a half years in India. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is a complete integration of the child with the social, physical, psychological, cultural and academic environment of either USA or India. After considering the documents placed on record, the High Court found that the appellant no.1 has not produced any further medical report or medical treatment record to show that the minor child requires further regular medical treatment apart from usual periodical review and therefore, it will not be difficult to arrange a periodical review even if the child is in USA. The High Court on examination of the documents found that the respondent no.1 had financial resources to maintain the appellant no.1 and the minor child in USA. Merely because the respondent no.1 had asked the appellant no.1 to arrange funds for purchase of lands in Bangalore, it cannot be said that his intention is to abandon USA and settle down permanently in India.           Moreover, the High Court noted that international travel consent signed by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 required that the minor should come back to USA on 26 th September, 2019. The High Court held that change in the travel plan was not discussed and consented by both the parties. The High Court also considered the allegation that the respondent no.1 has temperamental issues. In fact, the respondent no.1 produced a Psychological Evaluation Report dated 21st October 2020 issued by the Centre for Psychology which recorded that the respondent no.1 is free of any neurophysiological problems and has no diagnosable mental health problems. The certificate recorded that he is free of depression, anxiety and reports no suicidal tendencies. The High Court also considered the relevance of the report of the USA Embassy regarding the welfare of the child. The Court noted that there is a disclaimer in the said report that the consular officer who is the author of the report is not trained in child protection, social work, or other similar discipline and therefore, the report is not a child custody evaluation. The High Court has also noted the allegations and rival allegations against each other made by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1. About the argument that the appellant no.1 is taking constant care of the minor child, the High Court referred to the said report of the USA Embassy.        In paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Judgment, the High Court has noted the contents of the said report and has drawn conclusions which are recorded in paragraph 50. Paragraphs 48 to 50 of the impugned Judgment read “48. However, a perusal of the welfare report dated 17.12.2019 of Visiting Consular of US Embassy shows that respondent No.2 told the Visiting Consular that her aunt picks up minor child from school and brings him home each day and stays with him throughout the day while the mother and grand-parents are at work. The minor child has a domestic helper who takes care of his needs and plays with him. It is evident from the report that even respondent No.2 and her parents are not giving whole day personal care and attention to the minor child. 49. The petitioner has filed affidavit dated 15.06.2020 that the petitioner also has requisite skills to care for his child in the USA. The petitioner has also the option to work from home permanently, enabling him to care for the child full time when required. Hanumantharayya has a valid US visa till 23.02.2024 and has expressed her willingness to take care of the minor child to this Court. 50. In these facts and circumstances, there is no reasonable ground to believe that the minor child cannot be given due personal care and attention in USA and therefore, repatriation of the minor child cannot be declined on the ground of lack of requisite personal care and attention to the minor child in USA.” 29.    After considering the said aspects, the High Court issued directions in paragraphs 55, 57 and 58 which we have already quoted above. The factors considered by the High Court were certainly relevant. The High Court had the benefit of the assistance of a learned Counsel who was appointed as Amicus Curiae. He interacted with the contesting parties. The report of the Amicus Curiae has been considered by the High Court. 30.    The learned Judge of the High Court noted that except for the case filed by the respondent no.1 in USA Court regarding custody of the minor, there are no proceedings pending between the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1.     It was also noted that the welfare report dated 17 th December, 2019 of Visiting Consular of US Embassy records that the appellant no.1 informed that her aunt picks up the minor child from school and brings him home each day and stays with him throughout the day while the mother and grand-parents are at work. Moreover, a domestic helper is taking care of the needs of the child. Therefore, the appellant no.1 is not devoting her whole day to take personal care of the minor and to attend to the needs of the minor child. The High Court noted that on the other hand, an affidavit has been filed by the respondent no.1 that an option to permanently work from home is available to him and his mother has a valid visa to stay in USA till 23rd February 2024 who has expressed willingness to take care of the minor child in USA. The other factors considered by the High Court while holding a summary inquiry were that the stay of the minor child in India has been for too short a period to facilitate his integration into the social, physical, physiological, cultural and academic environment of India. Moreover, the minor child, if repatriated to USA, will not be subjected to an entirely foreign system of education. The High Court has also taken into consideration the fact that the child is a citizen of USA who will have better future prospects on return to USA. It is observed that the natural process of grooming in the environment of the native country is indispensable for his comprehensive development. The High Court further observed that it is not shown that return of the child to USA will be harmful to him. 31.    After having perused the material on record, we find that the High Court has considered all relevant factors while holding a summary inquiry. The High Court has given reasons for coming to the conclusion that it will be in the interest and welfare of the child to return to USA. The High Court has not treated the order of USA court as conclusive. The High Court had the benefit of the assistance of a learned Counsel who was appointed as amicus. The exercise of power by the High Court cannot be said to be perverse or illegal. We find that the High Court has not overlooked the view taken by larger Benches of this Court in the cases of Kanika (supra) and Nithya (supra). We are in agreement with High Court when it came to the conclusion that it will be in the welfare of the child to return to USA. 32.   The emphasis of the learned counsel appearing for appellants was more on the rights of the appellant no.1 and on making a departure from the well-known concept that the welfare of the minor is the paramount consideration. The said submissions are contrary to the law laid down by this Court in the case of Kanika (supra) as observed by us earlier. As we have noted earlier, the rights of the parents are irrelevant when a Court decides the custody issue. It is not a consideration at all for deciding the 33.   A question was raised whether the High Court was justified in passing an order directing the appellant no.1 to return to USA along with the minor child on or before a particular date.         The issue of custody of a minor, whether in a petition seeking habeas corpus or in a custody petition, has to be decided on the touchstone of the principle that the welfare of a minor is of paramount consideration. The Courts, in such proceedings, cannot decide where the parents should reside as it will affect the right to privacy of the parents. We may note here that a writ Court while dealing with the issue of habeas corpus cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go abroad with the child. If such orders are passed against the wishes of a parent, it will offend her/his right to privacy.   A parent has to be given an option to go abroad with the child. It ultimately depends on the parent concerned to decide and opt for giving a company to the minor child for the sake of the welfare of the child. It will all depend on the priorities of the concerned parent. In this case, on a conjoint reading of clauses (i) to (iii) of paragraph 55 of the judgment, it is apparent that such an option has been given to the appellant no.1. 34.   We may record here that an email dated 18 th October, 2021 addressed by the appellant no.1 to the respondent no.1 is placed on record along with I.A. No. 147418 of 2021. In the said email, the appellant no.1 has informed the respondent no.1 that during her visa interview, if she is asked, she will clearly state that the intended purpose of visiting USA was also to contest cases filed by the respondent no.1 and to file cases against the respondent no.1. Therefore, an option has to be given to the appellant no.1 to return to USA along with the minor son though she cannot be forced to stay with the respondent no.1. Therefore, the respondent no.1 will have to make proper arrangements for a suitable residence for the comfortable stay of the appellant no.1 in USA. The reason is that the appellant no.1 cannot work in USA on the basis of a B-2 visa. The respondent no.1 will have to provide a reasonable amount per month to the appellant no.1 to maintain herself and the child in USA. Necessary steps will have to be taken by the respondent no.1 to secure admission for the child in a school in USA. To enable the appellant no.1 to contest the custody petition filed by the respondent no.1, a direction will have to be issued to the respondent no.1 not to enforce and act upon the said order of USA Court in any manner for a period of three months from the date on which the appellant no.1 reaches USA with the son. During the said period of three months, visitation rights will have to be provided to the respondent no.1 to meet the minor child. If the appellant no.1 opts to go to USA and contest the custody proceedings, the parties will have to abide by the result of the said proceedings in so far as the issue of the custody of the minor child is 35.    The appellant no.1 will have to be given time of fifteen days from today to communicate the respondent no.1 her willingness to travel to USA with the child. If she intends to visit USA, along with her willingness, she must communicate possible dates of travel. The dates should be within maximum period of three months from today. On receiving the same, the respondent no.1 shall arrange for air tickets and make arrangements for the comfortable stay of the appellant no.1 and the minor in USA. The respondent no.1 shall, for the time being, transfer US$ 5,000 to the appellant no.1 for facilitating expenditure in USA. The respondent no.1, in addition, shall transfer US$ 1,500 to the appellant no.1 which can be used by the appellant no.1 for the benefit of the minor child in USA. The respondent no.1 will have to also provide a proper health insurance to both of them. The respondent no.1 will also be under an obligation to take care of medical treatment of the minor son. 36.   In the event the appellant no.1 fails to communicate her willingness to travel to USA within fifteen days from today, it will be open for the respondent no.1 to take the custody of the child. After the respondent no.1 arrives in India, the appellant no.1 shall hand over the custody of the minor son to the respondent no.1 to enable the respondent no.1 to take the minor son to USA. To the above extent, the order of the High Court requires modification.    As noted earlier, now B-2 visa has been granted to the appellant no.1. The respondent no.1 will have to also facilitate extension of visa granted to the appellant no.1, in case she desires to continue her stay (i)    It will be open for the appellant no.1 to travel to USA along with the minor child and to contest the proceedings pending in USA. If the appellant no.1 is willing to travel to USA along with the minor child, she will communicate her willingness to do so to the respondent no.1 by email within a period of fifteen days from today. The appellant no.1 shall communicate to the respondent no.1 the possible dates on which she proposes to travel along with the minor child. The possible dates shall be within three months from today; (ii)   On receiving an intimation as aforesaid, the respondent no.1 shall book air tickets after consulting the appellant no.1. The respondent no.1 shall make proper arrangements for separate stay of the appellant no.1 in USA after consulting her. The arrangements for residence shall be made at the cost of the respondent no.1. As and when the appellant no.1 wants to return to India, it shall be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay for her air tickets. If she wishes to continue in USA, the respondent no.1 shall take all possible steps for the (iii) In the event the appellant no.1 agrees to travel to USA along with the minor son, it will be the responsibility of the respondent no.1 to pay a sufficient amount per month to the appellant no.1 for maintenance of herself and the minor son. Along with the air tickets, the respondent no.1 shall remit US$ 6,500 to the appellant no.1 by a mutually convenient mode. The amount shall be utilised by the appellant no.1 to meet initial expenditure in USA. After the expiry of period of one month from the date on which the appellant no.1 arrives in USA, the respondent no.1 shall regularly remit a mutually agreed amount to the appellant no.1 for maintenance. If there be any dispute, the parties are free to adopt remedy in accordance with law. The respondent no.1 shall provide proper medical insurance to the appellant no.1 and the minor child while they are in USA. Moreover, the respondent no.1 shall be under an obligation to provide proper medical treatment to the minor child; (iv)   In the event, the appellant no.1 along with the minor child visits USA in terms of this order, for a period of three months from the date of her arrival, the respondent no.1 shall not take any steps to implement or enforce the order dated 3 rd February 2020 passed by the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas which will enable the appellant no.1 to move the concerned Court for contesting the petition filed by the respondent no.1 and to file appropriate proceedings. A written undertaking to that effect shall be filed by the respondent no.1 in this Court within two weeks from today. Thus, for the said period of three months, the custody of the minor shall remain with the appellant (v)       After the appellant no.1 and minor child reach USA, subject to the orders which may be passed by the competent Court in USA, for a period of 3 months from their arrival, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to have temporary custody of the minor child from 10 am to 5 pm on every Sunday or as mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1. In addition, the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to make a video call to talk to the minor child for about half an hour on every day (except Sunday) between 5 pm to 6 pm; (vi)   In the event, the appellant no.1 is not willing to visit USA along with her minor son and fails to communicate her willingness to visit USA within a period of fifteen days from today, it will be open for the respondent no.1 to take custody of the child. After the respondent no.1 visits India, the appellant no.1 shall hand over the custody of the minor child to him and the respondent no.1 shall be entitled to take the minor child with him to USA.       In such an event, the appellant no.1 will be entitled to talk to the minor child on video call for half an hour on every day between 5 pm to 6 pm (USA time) or at such time as mutually agreed upon by the appellant no.1 and the (vii) As observed by the High Court in paragraph 58 of the impugned Judgment, an option of adopting agreed joint parenting plan remains open to the parties. If they wish to do so, they can always file appropriate application before the High (viii) This order shall not be construed to mean that any final adjudication has been made on the rights of the parties. The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
2                The appeal arises from a judgment of a Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 10 August 2022 in Criminal Revision No 1670 of 3                The Additional Principal Judge of the Family Court at District Gautambudh Nagar, by an order dated 11 March 2022, allowed Miscellaneous Case No 197 of 2016 instituted by the appellants under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 and directed the second respondent to pay maintenance at the rate of Rs 20,000 per month to the first appellant and Rs 15,000 each to the second and third appellants, who are daughters of the first appellant and the second Digitally signed by 4 While setting aside the judgment of the Family Court, the High Court has encapsulated its entire reasoning in one paragraph, which is extracted below: “Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. Perusal of the impugned Judgement and order shows that the learned Family Court has recorded the findings that the revisionist is earning Rs. 2 lacs per month, on the other hand, the Income Tax Return (I.T.R.) filed by the revisionist shows that he is earning Rs. 4.5 lacs per annum. Furthermore, this Court failed to appreciate that on what basis the learned Family Court has recorded the findings that the income of revisionist is Rs. 2 lacs per month, when there is nothing on record to demonstrate the same.” 5 We have heard Mr Ravi Prakash Mehrotra, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and Ms Priya Hingorani, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the second respondent. 6 The judgment of the High Court does not reflect a correct appreciation of the reasons which weighed with the Family Court. The Family Court, inter alia, noted (i)   In the proceedings which he instituted under the Guardians and Wards Act 1890, the second respondent specifically averred that he is “a respectable member of his family and has good resources”; (ii)  It is an admitted position that the second respondent works as a (iii) While the second respondent claimed in the above proceeding that the first appellant was unable to maintain the minor children, he had filed documentary      evidence   about    his   educational  qualifications   for demonstrating his capability to raise the children; (iv)   Though the second respondent is in business with his father, he failed to disclose his income in the property statement; and (v)    The second respondent admitted that he has a rental house whose rent is paid by his father. 7 On the above premises, the Family Court came to the conclusion that the second respondent had concealed the income which he earns in the business which he carries on together with his father from the court. 8 The Family Court has also dealt with the statement of the first appellant that she was a partner in a company (stated to belong to her brother) and had an amount of Rs 12,000 in the bank account.        The Family Court observed that the first appellant is not working on a post in the company and, as a matter of fact, her expenses including on the children is borne by her parents, brother and sister. In this backdrop, the Family Court issued directions for the payment of maintenance in its order dated 11 March 2022. 9 The High Court ought to have been aware of the parameters of the revisional jurisdiction.  The extract from the judgment which has been set out above indicates that the High Court was of the view that: (i)    Whereas the first appellant stated that the second respondent earns an amount of Rs Two Lakhs per month, his income tax return indicates that the second respondent is earning Rs 4.5 Lakhs per annum; and (ii)   The Family Court had not indicated the basis on which it had assessed the income of the second respondent at Rs Two Lakhs per month. 10 On the first aspect, it is well-settled that income tax returns do not necessarily furnish an accurate guide of the real income.       Particularly, when parties are engaged in a matrimonial conflict, there is a tendency to underestimate income. Hence, it is for the Family Court to determine on a holistic assessment of the evidence what would be the real income of the second respondent so as to enable the appellants to live in a condition commensurate with the status to which they were accustomed during the time when they were staying together. The two children are aged 17 and 15 years, respectively, and their needs have to be duly met. 11 In this view of the matter, the High Court was not justified in setting aside the order of the Family Court on the basis of the reasoning which has been extracted above in the earlier part of this order. 12 At the same time, having heard submissions of both the parties, we are of the view that it would be appropriate to restore the Criminal Revision, namely, Criminal Revision No 1670 of 2022 to the file of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad for consideration afresh.       In order to facilitate this exercise, the impugned order of the High Court dated 10 August 2022 is set aside and the Criminal Revision is restored to the file of the High Court, conditional with the directions issued hereafter. 13 By the interim order of this Court dated 30 September 2022, this Court, while issuing notice, directed the second respondent to pay the arrears of maintenance computed in accordance with the order of 11 March 2022 of the Family Court to the appellants before the next date of listing. The petition was directed to be listed on 31 October 2022. 14 During the course of the hearing, Mr Ravi Prakash Mehrotra, senior counsel, has submitted a statement indicating that the second respondent has paid an amount of Rs 1,00,000 to the first appellant, Rs 1,50,000 to the second appellant and an amount of Rs 1,00,000 to the third respondent on 21 October 2022, 26 October 2022 and 27 October 2022 towards arrears of maintenance.              The statement tendered to this Court indicates that from 5 July 2016 until 31 October 2022, an amount of Rs 14.20 lakhs, Rs 10.40 lakhs and Rs 9.90 lakhs is due and outstanding to the three appellants respectively. 15 The second respondent has shown scant regard to the order of this Court by failing to comply with the interim direction.    Ordinarily, we would have been inclined to pass a coercive order against the second respondent, but, in order to furnish a further opportunity to him to comply, we are passing a conditional order.

This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.61 of 2015, pending on the file of the Judicial 2.The 2nd respondent company lodged a complaint against the petitioner before the 1st respondent Police on 18.05.2003 and the same was registered in Crime No.166 of 2003, for offence under Section 457 and 420 IPC. Gist of the complaint is that the 2nd respondent is the company viz., M/s.Micro Electric Controls, Periyanaickenpalayam, Coimbatore. The petitioner was employed as Machine Operator in the 2nd respondent company in the year 1998. On 29.07.1998, the petitioner gave resignation letter to the 2nd respondent company in presence of LW2, LW4 & LW5 that he was unable to continue with his work. On 30.07.1998, the petitioner's dues settled and he was relieved from the service. Suppressing the same, the petitioner filed a case before the Labour Court, Coimbatore in I.D.No.332 of 1999 claiming that his signature found in the resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998 is forged and that he used to sign without any line, but in the resignation letter, there is a line below the signature. After proper adjudication, I.D.No.332 of 1999 ended in favour of the petitioner on 11.03.2002. Aggrieved by the award passed by the Labour Court, Coimbatore, dated 11.03.2002, the 2 nd respondent filed a Writ Petition in W.P.No.7781 of 2003 before this Court and also filed W.M.P.No.10000 of 2003 for stay of operation of award, dated 11.03.2002, wherein this Court, by order, dated 12.03.2003 had granted interim stay directing the 2nd respondent company to deposit the entire backwages to the petitioner. Challenging the order of stay, dated 12.03.2003,          the 2nd respondent       preferred   an appeal           in W.A.No.1666 of 2003 and this Court, by order, dated 24.08.2006 confirmed the order of the stay, dated 12.03.2003. Thereafter, this Court, by order, dated 23.12.2009 dismissed the Writ Petition in W.P.No.7781 of 2003. 3.The petitioner filed a petition in C.P.No.52 of 2010 before the Labour Court, Coimbatore seeking arrears of his wages and to comply with the order of the Labour Court, Coimbatore in I.D.No.332 of 1999. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent company filed Interlocutory Application in I.A.No.287 of 2015 in C.P.No.52 of 2010 to pass an order to send the documents to the Forensic Lab and the same was dismissed on 01.06.2015.         Thereafter, C.P.No.52 of 2010 ended in favour of the petitioner, against which, the 2nd respondent company filed a Writ Petition in W.P.No.150 of 2022 and the same is pending. Further, the 2nd respondent filed Crl.O.P.No.1 of 2012 under Section 340 r/w 195(i)(b) of Cr.P.C., before the Labour Court, Coimbatore and the same was dismissed on 24.07.2017. 4.In the year 2004, the FIR registered against the petitioner in Crime No.166 of 2003 was closed as Mistake of Fact for the reason that the forged resignation letter was not produced and served the notice in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004, dated 17.06.2004 to the 2nd respondent company. Thereafter, in the year 2006, the trial Court destroyed the records in Crime No.166 of 2003. After termination of the proceedings before the Labour Court, Coimbatore as well as before this Court, the original resignation letter was obtained from the Labour Court, Coimbatore and the 2nd respondent company filed a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., on 17.11.2012 in C.M.P.No.908 of 2013 in Crime No.166 of 2003 before the trial Court.         At that time, the 2 nd respondent company was informed about the destruction of case records, hence, he filed a petition in C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 for reconstruction of the case records in Crime No.166 of 2003. The trial Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 ordered reconstruction of the destroyed records and for further investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003.                During further investigation, the resignation letter was sent for forensic examination, where the handwriting expert confirmed that the signature of the petitioner and the signature found in his resignation letter are one and the same.         Finding that the petitioner has committed the forgery and cheating, the 1st respondent Police filed final report listing LW1 to LW8 and several documents before the trial Court. The trial Court finding prima facie case against the petitioner, took the case on file in C.C.No.61 of 2015, against which, the present Quash Petition. 5.The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner worked as Machine Operator in the 2nd respondent company in the year 1998. On 29.07.1998, he had given a resignation letter stating that he is no more interested in continuing with his job and asked for his backwages. Based on his resignation letter, he was relieved from service on 30.07.1998. Thereafter, he disputed his resignation letter and claimed that the resignation letter was forged one and thereafter, he filed a Industrial Dispute case in I.D.No.322 of 1999 before the Labour Court, Coimbatore.     The Labour Court, Coimbatore by an award dated 11.03.2002 found that the alleged resignation letter, which has been marked as Ex.P3 has not been sent to the hand writing expert and hence, it cannot be said to be forged and held the case in industrial dispute in favour of the petitioner, directing the 2nd respondent company to permit the petitioner to continue his employment. Aggrieved by the award passed by the Labour Court, Coimbatore, the 2nd respondent company had filed a writ petition in W.P.No.7781 of 2003 before this Court. Pending the writ petition, the 2nd respondent had filed a petition in W.M.P.No.10000 of 2003 prayed for stay of the operation of the award dated 11.03.2002. The learned Single Judge, on 12.03.2003 had granted an order of stay directing the 2nd respondent company herein to deposit the entire backwages to the petitioner. Challenging the order of stay, the 2nd respondent company had preferred an appeal in W.A.No.1666 of 2003 and this Court, by order, dated 24.08.2006 confirmed the order of the learned single Judge and hence, it attained finality. 6.He further submitted that this Court, on 23.12.2009 had dismissed the writ petition in W.P.No.7781 of 2003, holding that the burden of proof was cast upon the person, who relies upon the said document.        In this case, the Labour Court, Coimbatore gave cogent reasons elaborately as to why the theory of resignation could not be accepted by it in paragraph Nos.10, 12, 13, 14 and 16 and further observed that it is the duty of the 2nd respondent company to send the alleged resignation letter to hand writing expert to confirm the signature found in Ex.M3 is that of the petitioner, which they failed to do so and held the case in favour of the petitioner. Thereafter, the petitioner had filed a petition in C.P.No.52 of 2010 seeking arrears of his wages and to comply with the earlier order of the Labour Court, Coimbatore. In the meanwhile, the 2nd respondent company had filed Interlocutory Application in I.A.No.287 of 2015 in C.P.No.52 of 2010 under Section 11(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act r/w Section 45 of the Evidence Act and 151 of C.P.C., to pass an order to send the documents to the Forensic Lab and the same was dismissed by order, dated 01.06.2015, wherein, it was observed as follows:- “The writ petition filed by the petitioner against the award is dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras on 23.12.2009. The copy of the order marked as Ex.W8. Since the M.w.1 has admitted that the memo of understanding was filed before the Hon'ble High Court, Madras in Writ Appeal in W.A.No.1666/2003 and he had agreed    to  provide    employment      with   effect     from 01.11.2003 as per Ex.W15, it is not necessary to send those documents prior to the period of 01.11.2003 to the handwriting expert for comparison. The Hon'ble High Court also has arrived back wages of Rs.1,80,000/- while passing an order Ex.W.7 dated 24.08.2006. Therefore, the relief sought by the petitioner/respondent is unnecessary and unwarranted and he is not entitled to the relief as prayed for. Thus, this point is answered.” 7.The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that C.P.No.52 of 2010 had ended in his favour, against which, the 2 nd respondent had filed a Writ Petition in W.P.No.150 of 2022 and the same is pending. The 2nd respondent company had also filed Crl.O.P.No.1 of 2012 under Section 340 r/w 195(i)(b) of Cr.P.C., before the Labour Court, Coimbatore. The Labour Court, Coimbatore, by order, dated 24.07.2017 dismissed the petition, against which, the 2nd respondent company did not prefer any appeal. On the contrary, he managed to re-open the criminal case and proceed against the petitioner. 8.The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the 1st respondent Police had closed the case as Mistake of Fact and served the notice in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004 on 17.06.2004 and filed the closure report before the trial Court. As stated above, the proceedings before the Labour Court, Coimbatore as well as before this Court were agitated by the 2nd respondent company and all the cases ended in favour of the petitioner. After lapse of 11 years, the charge sheet was filed by the 1 st respondent Police in this case. More so, the case was reopened and no notice was served to the petitioner while reopening the case. It is settled preposition that if any adverse order is being passed on the further investigation, notice to the issued to the person who is affected and thereafter hearing his objections, the trial Court to take the case on file. In this case, after lapse of 11 years, how come charge sheet has been filed is not known. The specific case of the petitioner is that the petitioner has not written his resignation letter nor affixes his signature in the same. The 2nd respondent had filed W.P.No.150 of 2022 seeking quashing of the order passed in C.P.No.52 of 2010, dated 02.11.2021. This is the only petition which is pending now, that too, with regard to bonus granted by the Labour Court, Coimbatore in favour of the petitioner. 9.He further submitted that the 2nd respondent company earlier filed petitions before the Labour Court, Coimbatore to send the resignation letter, which is in dispute, to Forensic Department and the same were dismissed. He further submitted that in the year 2004, the FIR registered against the petitioner in Crime No.166 of 2003 was closed as Mistake of Fact for the reason that the alleged forged resignation letter was not produced and served the notice in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004, dated 17.06.2004 to the 2nd respondent company. Thereafter, in the year 2006, the trial Court destroyed the records in Crime No.166 of 2003. After termination of the proceedings before the Labour Court, Coimbatore as well as before this Court, the original resignation letter was obtained from the Labour Court, Coimbatore and the 2nd respondent company filed a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., on 17.11.2012 in C.M.P.No.908 of 2013 in Crime No.166 of 2003 before the trial Court. At that time, the 2nd respondent company was informed about the destruction of case records, hence, he filed a petition in C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 for reconstruction of the case records in Crime No.166 of 2003. The trial Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 ordered reconstruction of destroyed records and for further investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003.       Thereafter, reconstruction was done and further investigation was conducted by the 1st respondent Police. He further submitted        that  the    Deputy      Superintendent       of      Police, Periyanaickenpalayam seems to be more interest and loyal to the 2nd respondent company, without any judicial order, he sent the documents for forensic study and based on the forensic report, the charge sheet was filed by the 1st respondent Police. While that being so, the trial Court ought not to have taken cognizance of the case. Hence, he prayed for quashing of the proceedings against the petitioner. 10.The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of “Chinnathambi @ Subramani Versus State, rep. by the Inspector of Police, Vellakovil Police Station, Tirupur District reported in 2017 (2) CTC 241” wherein certain guidelines were given by this Court, which have not been followed in this case. 11.The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent company submitted that after termination of the proceedings before the Labour Court, Coimbatore, the 2nd respondent company obtained the original resignation letter of the petitioner, dated 29.07.1998.               He further submitted that initially, the case in Crime No.166 of 2003 was closed as Mistake of Fact for the reason that the original resignation letter could not be produced during investigation.            After obtaining the original resignation letter, the 2nd respondent company approached the trial Court and he was informed that the case records in Crime No.166 of 2003 was destroyed in the year 2006 itself. Hence, the 2 nd respondent company filed a petition for reconstruction in C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 and produced the copy of the complaint, FIR in Crime No.166 of 2003 and the trial Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 ordered reconstruction of destroyed records. The 2nd respondent also filed a petition under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., for further investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003, since the original resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998 was obtained.            The trial Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 ordered further investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003.       During further investigation, it was conclusively proved and confirmed by the Forensic Department that the signature in the resignation letter is that of the petitioner. The contention of the petitioner that the signature in his resignation letter is a forged one, cannot absolve him from the case. From the year 1998, the petitioner had been filing petitions before the Labour Court, Coimbatore as well as before this Court and obtained orders in his favour suppressing the true facts. Now, the Forensic Department confirmed that the signature found in the resignation letter is that of the petitioner. In the larger interest of justice, the trial Court considering the submissions of the 2nd respondent company accepted the further investigation petition and directed the 1st respondent Police to conduct further investigation, by order, dated 12.He further submitted that the investigation was conduced in a proper manner after obtaining appropriate orders from the trial Court, which cannot be questioned by the petitioner. Hence, he prayed for dismissal of the Quash Petition. 13.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the 1st respondent Police produced the Case Diary and made his submissions that since the disputed resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998 was not available and only photostat copy was available, the Assistant Director, Document Division, Forensic Department returned the photostat copy of the resignation letter without examination, hence, the FIR was closed as Mistake of Fact and notice in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004 was served on the 2nd respondent company. After prolonged litigation before the Labour Court, Coimbatore, finally, the 2nd respondent obtained the original resignation letter and submitted the same before the trial Court and filed a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., in C.M.P.No.908 of 2013. At that time, the trial Court was informed that in the year 2006, the entire records in Crime No.166 of 2003 were destroyed. Hence, the 2nd respondent company also filed a petition in C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 for reconstruction of case records in Crime No.166 of 2003. Both the petitions were allowed by the trial Court on 06.02.2013 and direction was given to the 1st respondent Police to conduct further investigation, hence, the further investigation was conducted and the 2nd respondent and other witnesses were examined, documents collected. Based on the forensic report and the statement of the witnesses, charge sheet was filed in this case. 14.He further submitted that the 1st respondent Police only acted on the directions of the trial Court in conducting further investigation in this case. As regards the labour dispute between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent company is concerned, the 1st respondent Police is not concerned about the same. Hence, he prayed for dismissal of the quash petition. 15.This Court considered the rival submissions and perused the materials available on record. 16.It is seen that there was a long battle between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent.           The crux of the issue is that according to the petitioner, the resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998, is a forged. Thereafter, there have been several litigations before this Court as well as before the Labour Court, Coimbatore. 17.The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the petitioner used to sign his signature without any underline. In the resignation letter, there is underline, hence, he claims that the signature in the resignation letter is forged. In the year 2003, the 2 nd respondent company obtained direction under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., from the trial Court, as per the direction, the 1st respondent Police registered FIR in Crime No.166 of 2003 against the petitioner, thereafter, the case was closed as Mistake of Fact in R.C.S.No.230 of 2004 on 17.06.2004. In the year 2006, the case records in Crime No.166 of 2003 were destroyed. This being the case, suddenly in the year 2013, the 2nd respondent filed a petition before the trial Court for reconstruction in C.M.P.No.899 of 2013 and for further investigation claiming that he obtained the original resignation letter from the Labour Court. Strangely, in both the petitions, the 1st respondent Police is not shown as party. The trial Court, by order, dated 06.02.2013 directed the 1st respondent Police to conduct further investigation in Crime No.166 of 2003. 18.On perusal of the case diary, it is seen that there is a proceedings, dated 03.02.2014 in Na.Ka.No.10/Memo/SDOPNP/2014 of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam, Sub Division, Coimbatore District, who directed the Inspector of Police Periyanaickenpalayam that the 2nd respondent approached this Court and obtained order to register a case and conduct investigation against the petitioner. The Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam, Sub Division, Coimbatore District sent the above proceedings to the 1st respondent Police along with the copy of the 2nd respondent's complaint, salary documents containing his signature, the petitioner's resignation letter, his leave letter and the report of the Forensic Department. Further, in the Case Diary, there is a receipt of Forensic Department in No.0592574, dated 27.11.2012 acknowledging the receipt of Rs.1,500/- and the document submitted for forensic examination has been assigned as document No.25 of 2012. The report of the Forensic Department, dated 09.04.2012 is addressed to the Deputy Superintendent of Police, acknowledged the receipt of documents through Grade-I Police Constable No.1900 Tr.V.Sreenivasan, which was without any seal. There have been 16 documents S1 to S16 and one questioned document were examined. The questioned document is the resignation letter, dated 29.07.1998. On verification of S1 to S16, it is found that in all the sixteen documents, there is no underline after the signature of the petitioner except S8, a letter, dated 25.03.1995 and S15, a leave permission slip, dated 12.07.2003. In the Forensic Report, there is no mention with regard to comparison of underline, which is the crux of the issue in this case. 19.It is strange to see under what authority, the Deputy Superintendent        of   Police, Periyanaickenpalayam    Sub       Division, Coimbatore sent the documents for forensic examination is not known. It is seen that the 2nd respondent filed a petition for reconstruction and further investigation on 17.11.2012 and the orders were passed only on 06.02.2013 and the order was communicated to the concerned Police only on 19.06.2014. It is also to be seen that the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam had paid the fee for Rs.1,500/- for examination of the documents, which is not a usual procedure. Thus, even before reconstruction and further investigation, how the Deputy Superintendent of Police conducted preliminary investigation is not known.          Admittedly, no specimen signature of the petitioner was obtained. Thus, from the Forensic Report, no case could be made out against the petitioner, since no study was made on the underline of the signature. 20.From the statement of the witnesses annexed in the final report, it is seen that LW1 to LW5 are from the 2 nd respondent company, LW6 is the Scientific Officer, LW7 is the Deputy Superintendent of Police and LW8 is the Inspector of Police. Already, the 2nd respondent company filed petition before the Labour Court, Coimbatore to send the documents for forensic study, which was rejected. Suppressing the same, the 2 nd respondent company managed through the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam for forensic study, which is not proper. The report of the Forensic Department is also not a complete document. The act of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam is not in the manner known to law. Thus, the entire further investigation is tainted and coloured one. The trial Court ought to have seen the manner in which the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam Sub Division, Coimbatore had conducted investigation/enquiry in Crime No.166 of 2003, when the case has already been closed as Mistake of Fact. Only on the direction of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam Sub Division, Coimbatore, the 2nd respondent filed a petition under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C., in C.M.P.No.908 of 2013 to get authenticated. Thus, the act of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Periyanaickenpalayam Sub Division, Coimbatore is not acceptable and it is abuse of process of law. Earlier, the 2nd respondent filed petition before the Labout Court seeking identical relief, which was negatived. Thereafter, the present cause of action initiated, which is not acceptable, proper and that cannot be approved. 21.In view of the above, the proceedings in C.C.No.61 of 2015, on the file of the Judicial Magistrate Court No.VI, Coimbatore, is hereby quashed.          Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed. Consequently, the connected Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
