The Supreme Court has reiterated and held that "where an enactment requires to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way and in no other manner" in the judgment of State of U.P. & Ors. vs. Virendra Kumar & Ors.  A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Abhay S. Oka and Vikram Nath have delivered the judgment which has been authored by Justice Abhay S. Oka.  The brief facts of the case were that under Section 3 of the Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam, 1965 (for short 'the 1965 Act'), Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad (for short 'the Board') was established. The basic object of the establishment of the Board was framing and executing housing and improvement schemes in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The larger issue that was up for consideration before the bench through a reference made by a division bench of the Supreme Court in State of U.P. vs. Preetam Singh & Ors. 2014 (15) SCC 774 was whether the act of determining service conditions of the employees and officers of the Board is one of the statutory functions of the Board.  First, let's have a look at the three referral questions.  THREE REFERRAL QUESTIONS   The three questions up for consideration before the three judge bench were as follows:  (1) Whether the judgment of this Court in State if U.P. vs. Preetam Singh & Ors. 2014 (15) SCC 774 laying down that conditions of service of officers and employees do not constitute the functions of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad lays down the correct law more so when the judgment does not refer to provisions of Sections 8, 92, 94(2)(nn)of the 1965 Act ?  (2) Whether the view expressed in Preetam Singh's judgment that functions of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad are only the specific functions enumerated in Section 15 of 1965 Act which does not include the service conditions of employees of the Board lays down the correct law ? Whereas the functions of the Board referred to in other provisions of Act, Rules and Regulations as has been expressly provided in Section 15(1) by use of expression "subject to the provisions of this Act and the Rules and Regulations" shall also be functions of the Board which induces service conditions of officers and employees as per Section 95(1)(f) of the 1965 Act.  (3) Whether the State Government had no jurisdiction to issue directions regarding service conditions of officers and employees of the U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad under the provisions of the 1965 Act and 1975 Act and all other enabling powers with the State Government?  The court set out to answer the above questions by engaging itself in a discussion on three key aspects.  POWER TO DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF THE OFFICERS AND SERVANTS OF THE BOARD  The judgment starts by first laying out the bare provisions from the legislation. It states that the statute nowhere grants the state government the explicit power to determine conditions of service of the officers and servants. It clearly distinguishes between the power of the state government to control the recruitment process vis-a-vis the power of the Board to determine the conditions of service of the officers and the servants.  It says, "26…Subsection (1) of Section 8 does not provide that the State Government shall have the power to determine the conditions of service of officers and employees of the Board. The power to control the appointment and the power to put restrictions are distinct and different from the power to determine the service conditions of the officers and servants of the Board. The control of the State Government and the power to impose restrictions as provided in subsection (1) of Section 8 will extend to the creation of posts of officers and servants of the Board. The control can be exercised by directing the creation of different categories of posts. The control can be also exercised by determining the number of posts of different categories.  However, the court then points to a provision within the statute that grants the State government the power to make Rules. In this context it points to Section 94(2)(nn) from the 1965 Act which reads as follows:  Clause (nn) of sub­section (2) of Section 94 reads thus :  "94. Power to make Rules.­ (1) ... ... ... ...  (2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for­   (nn) any matter for which regulation may be made by the Board under Section 95;"  The above clause (nn) of sub­section (2) of Section 94 clearly confers power on the State Government to frame Rules in respect of any matter for which regulations can be framed by the Board.  On the other hand, the court says, "Clause (f) of sub­section (1) of Section 95 specifically empowers the Board to frame Regulations governing conditions of service of officers and servants of the Board. The reason is that the power to determine the service conditions of the other officers and servants has been conferred on the Board which can be exercised by making Regulations."  After a conjoint reading of the above provision, the court concludes as follows:  "27. In view of sub­section (2) of Section 95 read with clause (nn) of sub­section (2) of Section 94, Regulations, if any, framed by the Board for determining the conditions of services of its officers and servants are always subject to the Rules which may be framed by the State Government by exercising the power under clause (nn) of sub­section (1) of Section 94. Whenever there is any inconsistency between the Regulations framed under clause (f) of sub­section (1) of Section 95 and the Rules framed under clause (nn) of sub­ section (1) of Section 94, the Rules will prevail and to that extent, the provisions of the Regulations which are repugnant to the Rules shall be void. To put it differently, the power to determine the conditions of service of the officers (except the Housing Commissioner) and servants of the Board vests in the Board, and the said power can be exercised only by framing Regulations under clause (f) of sub section (1) of Section 95. So long as Rules are not framed by the State Government under clause (nn) of sub­ section (1) of Section 95 for overriding the provisions of the Regulations framed by the Board for prescribing the service conditions, the provisions of Regulations shall always govern the field. Except for the exercise of the Rule making power under clause (nn) of sub­section (1) of Section 94, there is no specific power conferred under the 1965 Act, or for that matter under the 1975 Act, on the State Government to nullify or to override the conditions of service of its officers and servants determined by the Board by the Regulations framed in the exercise of powers under clause (f) of sub­section (1) of Section 95."  FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD   On the question of the function of the board, the court concluded as follows:   "30…The nature of the functions of a statutory body like the Board will always depend on the object of establishing such a body. The appointment of officers and servants needs to be made for the efficient performance of the specific functions of the Board. The exercise of power to appoint servants and officers of the Board and determination of their service conditions cannot constitute the functions of the Board. The powers under Chapter V and the power of appointing officers and servants under Sections 7 and 8 of Chapter II need to be exercised for ensuring proper discharge of the functions of the Board as well as for the exercise of the powers set out in Chapter III. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the appointment of officers and servants and determination of their service conditions cannot constitute functions of the Board."  POWER OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE DIRECTIONS TO THE BOARD REGARDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SERVICE CONDITIONS OF THE BOARD  The issue for consideration before the court was whether the State Government can exercise its power to override statutory Regulations framed by the Board. The court concluded as follows:  As the scheme of the 1965 Act specifically provides that Regulations framed under Section 94 can be overridden by framing Rules in accordance with clause (nn) of sub­section (1) of Section 94, the act of overriding the Regulations must be done only by framing the Rules and not in any other manner. This view is supported by a series of decisions of this Court taking a consistent view that where an enactment requires to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way and in no other manner. There are several decisions taking that view ending with the decision of this Court in the case of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam. However, the locus classicus on this point is the well known decision of the Privy Council in the case of Nazir Ahmed v. The King Emperor. The upshot of the aforesaid discussion is that the State Government has no power to issue directions under sub­section (2) of Section 92 to nullify or override the Regulations framed by the Board in the exercise of powers under clause (f) of sub­section (1) of Section 95.  At the end, the court answered the three questions in the following manner:   (1) The decision lays down the correct proposition of law.   (2) The first part of the question is answered in the affirmative. The functions of the Board are as specified in Section 15 and other relevant sections in Chapter III of the 1965 Act. The second part is answered in the negative.   (3) Answered in affirmative. But the State Government can always frame Rules in the exercise of powers under clause (nn) of sub section (1) of Section 94 of the 1965 Act for determining the conditions of service of the servants and officers of the Board. Whenever there is any inconsistency between Regulations framed under clause (f) of sub­section (1) of Section 95 and the Rules framed under clause (nn) of sub­section (1) of Section 94, the Rules will prevail and to that extent, the provisions of the Regulations which are repugnant to the Rules shall be void.

The Bombay High Court's Aurangabad bench recently enhanced compensation awarded to a deceased truck driver's kin under the Employees' Compensation Act, 1923 relying on the oral testimony of the wife. Justice SG Dige observed that the labour court wrongly discarded the wife's evidence in the absence of a salary slip in a 19-year-old-case.  "The deceased was driver of the truck vehicle so no question of salary certificate arise as he was private employee of truck owner. Generally, the wife knows salary of the husband," the High Court observed. The court increased the salary consideration from Rs. 2000 to Rs 3000 per month as the wife had claimed her husband was receiving Rs. 4000 inclusive if Bhatta (extra earned on the side.) It therefore enhanced the award from Rs.2,11,790 plus 9% interest to Rs.3,17,685 along with 12% interest. On 31st January, 2003, when the deceased Parmeshwar was driving his truck at 6.00 am, a truck from the opposite direction collided with his truck, killing him immediately.  The appellants included the driver's parents, wife and two-year-old son. They approached the Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation and Judge, Labour Court, Latur who considered the driver's salary only at Rs 2000 in the absence of documentary proof and used 9% as the interest rate.  In their 2004 appeal the family claiming that the wife's testimony was wrongly discarded and the interest amount was also less than what the statute provided.  The respondent's counsel argued that the trial Court has passed the judgment and order on the basis of evidence led before the trial court, and has considered all the aspects. No evidence was produced before the trial Court to prove that the deceased was getting Rs.4,000 per month as salary.  While the High Court relied on the wife's statement for the salary, it noted that according to Section 4-A of the Employees' Compensation Act, 1923, 12% interest would apply as a penalty to the employer for not clearing the compensation within a month.  The bench disposed off the petition accordingly.  Case Title : Sunita and ors v Sandipan Dyanoba Tathapare and anr  
The Supreme Court, on Friday, held that the notification issued by the Central Government in 2021 - which took away the rights of Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) category students to apply for general seats and confined their right only to Non-Resident Indians (NRI) category seats- will apply only prospectively from the date of the notification, which is March 4, 2021. The notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on March 4, 2021 stated that OCI students can only apply to NRI seats or supernumerary seats for all India entrance tests like NEET, JEE(Mains) and JEE (Advanced) and barred them from applying to seats exclusively reserved for Indian citizens. Delivering judgment on petitions filed challenging these restrictions, the Court held that the provisions of the notification "shall apply prospectively only to persons who are born in a foreign country subsequent to 04.03.2021 i.e. the date of the notification and who seek for a registration as OCI cardholder from that date". The Court further held that that the "petitioners in all these cases and all other similarly placed OCI cardholders will be entitled to the rights and privileges which had been conferred on them earlier to the notification dated 04.03.2021 and could be availed by them notwithstanding the exclusion carved out in the notification dated 04.03.2021".  This means that the rights of those who are OCI card holders till 04.03.2021 will not get affected and all pre-existing rights are saved. The Court had earlier passed interim orders allowing certain OCI petitioners to apply for general category seats for 2021-2022 academic year. These admissions have been regularised, said Justice AS Bopanna while pronouncing the judgment. The Court observed in the judgment that the notification suffered from "non-application of mind" as it had the effect of retroactively taking away the rights of those who had secured OCI cards before 04.03.2021. The judgment was pronounced in a batch of petitions filed by OCI students challenging the 2021 notification. A bench comprising Justices AS Bopanna and CT Ravikumar heard the matter. "Though the impugned notification dated 04.03.2021 is based on a policy and in the exercise of the statutory power of a Sovereign State, the provisions as contained therein shall apply prospectively only to persons who are born in a foreign country subsequent to 04.03.2021 i.e. the date of the notification and who seek for a registration as OCI cardholder from that date since at that juncture the parents would have a choice to either seek for citizenship by descent or to continue as a foreigner in the background of the subsisting policy of the Sovereign State". Most petitioners had completed their education in India; unfair to ask them to go back to their birth nation now The Court noted that most petitioners had completed their entire school education in India, despite their birth in a foreign country. It further noted that the Central Government had been expanding the rights bestowed on OCI card holders through its previous notifications issued in 2005. These rights were conferred in exercise of powers under Section 7B of the Citizenship Act 1955. In this background, though the doctrine of legitimate expectation may not apply strictly, the Court observed that the "statutory right conferred had sown the seed of hope recognising the affiliation to this country". "Having undertaken the entire educational career in India or at least the High School onwards, they cannot at this stage turn back to the country in which they were born to secure the professional education as they would not be in a position to compete with the students there either, keeping in view the study pattern and the monetary implications", the Court stated in the judgment Statutory rights should not be withdrawn in an arbitrary manner The Court stated, "the right of the OCI Cardholders is a midway right in the absence of dual citizenship. When a statutory right was conferred and such right is being withdrawn through a notification, the process for withdrawal is required to demonstrate that the action taken is reasonable and has nexus to the purpose. It should not be arbitrary, without basis and exercise of such power cannot be exercised unmindful of consequences merely because it is a sovereign power". No material to show benefits to OCI students deprived Indian students' opportunities The Centre's justification was that the move was intended to protect the admissions for Indian students. However, the Court said that except a bare statement, "there is no material with regard to the actual exercise undertaken to arrive at a conclusion that the participation of OCI Cardholders in the selection process has denied the opportunity of professional education to the Indian citizens". The Court formed the opinion that there are rights accrued to OCI students who had been living in India for past several years ( the judgment illustrated the case of a petitioner who had been living in India since 2003), which cannot be retroactively taken away abruptly. "The goal post is shifted when the game is about to be over. Hence we are of the view that the retroactive operation resulting in retrospective consequences should be set aside and such adverse consequences is to be avoided", the Court held. The Court also expressed the view that the future application of notification should be re-looked by the "higher echelons of the Executive" having regard to the wide ramifications on the Indian diaspora. Last year, the Supreme Court had passed an interim order allowing OCI candidates to apply to general seats for NEET admissions. However, the Court had clarified that the interim order was confined only to the 2021-2022 academic year. In the present academic year, instead of granting interim relief, the Supreme Court said that it would hear the matter at length and finally decide the same. Arguments during hearing Referring to the judgment in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, Senior Advocate, Mr. P. Chidambaram, appearing on behalf of the OCI students, had submitted that while classification is allowed, micro-classification has been frowned upon by this Court. He had pointed out that, while those with OCI status are eligible only for NRI seats, NRIs can apply for NRI as well as Indian seats. It had been argued that till 2020, the OCI students were considered for general category seats.  Senior Advocate, Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, appearing for students who are born to OCI parents, and have been residing in India had submitted that OCIs can't be compared with Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), as the NRIs are living abroad and are earning in foreign currency. However, many OCI families are staying in India. The Senior Counsel explained that OCI was a concept introduced by the Government of India in 2005 to confer certain rights to persons of Indian origin, who may have foreign citizenship. The scheme was floated to encourage them to settle in India and seek their services here. In some cases, children may have obtained foreign citizenship when they were born abroad while their parents were working there. They might have returned to India later; they might have been brought up in India, but still have the OCI status due to their foreign citizenship.  It had been also emphasised on that the percentage of NRI seats in medical admissions is very less and the fees for such seats is exorbitant, which can't be afforded by OCI students living in India. ASG Aishwarya Bhati ,appearing for the Union Government, submitted that the petitioners are trying to compete in the seats meant for Indian citizens, who have no avenues outside, whereas the OCI students can get citizenship rights abroad.  During the course of the hearing the Bench had asked the Senior Counsel for the OCI students why they are not giving up their foreign citizenships to compete in the general category for admission to medical colleges.  Mr. Vishwanathan had addressed the concern raised by the Bench by submitting that the petitioners are not seeking conferral of any new rights but the continuation of the benefits which were being given till 2021. In this regard, he had referred to Section 7B of the Citizenship Act 1955, which states that the OCI persons are entitled to the rights specified by the Government. Since the rights had been in existence for long, there is a legitimate expectation and the sudden withdrawal of the rights is arbitrary. It had been asserted, many OCIs chose to settle in India on the basis of the rights conferred under Section 7B. Mr. Vishwanathan had contended that the Centre's notification is painting all OCIs with the same brush, without considering persons who have been residing in India for long.

The Allahabad High Court last week stayed an order passed by the Uttar Pradesh Police transferring an investigation into an 'Anti-Love Jihad Law' matter [U.P. Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020] to Karnataka Police and called for a response from the State Government. The Bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Saroj Yadav was hearing the plea of a lady, Umme Kulsum, who sought quashing of an order passed by the Police Commissioner, U.P., Lucknow transferring the investigation in a case registered under UP Anti-Love Jihad Law, among others, to the Commissioner of Police, Banglore City. The Case in brief The petitioner, Kulsum, had lodged a Case Crime/F.I.R. under Sections 498-A, 323, 506, 507, 384 I.P.C., Sections 3, 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and Sections 3, 5(1) of U.P. Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020, Police Station Indira Nagar, District Lucknow against accused respondent nos.3 and 4. However, the Police Commissioner, U.P., Lucknow transferred its investigation to Commissioner of Police, Banglore City, and aggrieved with the same, Kulsum moved the High Court seeking quashing of the said Order.  Advocate Vikas Vikram Singh appearing for the petitioner, Kulsum, submitted that the impugned order of Police Commissioner, U.P., Lucknow was liable to be quashed on the ground that it was a matrimonial dispute and simply because some part of the incident had taken place at Banglore, the same can't be a ground for transfer of the investigation to another place. In view of this submission, the Court granted two weeks' time to the State of UP to file a counter affidavit in the matter and listed the matter for September 27, 2021.  The Court also directed that till the next date of listing, effect and operation of the impugned order dated 10.08.2021 passed by the Police Commissioner, U.P., Lucknow shall remain stayed.

On Friday, the Supreme Court found no fault with the view taken by the Delhi High Court, that it is not within the domain of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) to downgrade the Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR) for a previous year that had already been acted upon.

On Friday, the Supreme Court found no fault with the view taken by the Delhi High Court, that it is not within the domain of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) to downgrade the Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR) for a previous year that had already been acted upon. The Apex Court observed that the DPC couldn't have downgraded the officer without putting him on notice, when the concerned authority had recorded reasons for upgrading him.  A bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M.M. Sundresh dismissed a Petition filed by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) assailing a 2019 order of the Delhi High Court directing a review DPC for consideration of Avtar Singh Arora's (Respondent No.1) promotion to the post of Special Director General (Electricity & Mechanical) in the Central Public Works Department.  Factual Background  The Respondent No. 1 joined as an Assistant Executive Engineer (E&M) in 1983. On 6th August, 2014 the Respondent No. 1 was communicated his APAR for the period between 13th June, 2013 and 31st March, 2014. In the APAR for the said period, the Respondent No. 1 was given zero points against Column No. 3.1 (ii) and a grading of 5.63 by the Reviewing Authority, 7 points in the aforesaid column and overall 7 was rewarded by the Reporting Officer. The Accepting Authority gave the Respondent No.1 a grading of 5 points. Overall grading of the Respondent No.1 was "Good", which was a below benchmark grading. He submitted a representation to the Minister of Urban Development and his grade was revised to "Very Good" by awarding him 6.57 grade points. Consequently, he was promoted to the post of ADG (E&M).  In December, 2017, when the DPC was considering his promotion to the post of SDG (E&M) against the vacancy year 2018, it found him unfit based on the initial rating of 5 points in the assessment of 2013-14. The Respondent submitted a representation to the concerned authority, seeking a review DPC, which was eventually rejected. Aggrieved, the Respondent No. 1 approached the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) to set aside the decision of DPC. CAT dismissed the application and the matter went to the Delhi High Court. The High Court acknowledged that there was a limited scope for judicial review in the matter.   "...the only aspect, which in our view, needs consideration is whether the representation of the petitioner and the response of the reporting officer, reviewing officer and the accepting officer were placed before the DPC, when it arrived at its decision to find the petitioner unfit."   Observing that there were clear reasons cited by the concerned authority for upgrading the Respondent No. 1, in 2014, the High Court noted that it was therefore incumbent on the DPC to provide reasons for differing in their view. Moreover referring to OM dated 9th May, 2014, the Court stated -   "It specifically states that "the DPC should substantiate its assessment by giving justifiable and sustainable reasons including the cases where the assessment of the DPC is different from the grading in APAR."  Finally, considering the assessment of DPC was in the nature of suo-motu review of a grading of a previous year on the basis of which the Respondent had already been promoted as ADG, the High Court directed a review DPC.   Proceeding before the Supreme Court  At the outset, Advocate Mr. Naresh Kaushik appearing on behalf of UPSC, apprised the Supreme Court that the High Court had not considered a crucial aspect in the matter. He submitted -  "A very crucial factor has been ignored by the Hon'ble High Court. This Court had laid down that assessment by expert bodies need not be interfered with by judicial bodies."  The Bench retorted that the High Court had merely pointed out that the requisite material was not placed before DPC.  "As I understand, the High Court says that the material should have been placed. That's all." Mr. Kaushik informed the Court that all relevant material was placed before DPC.  "That was placed. That has not been considered." Explaining the limited scope of the order of the High Court, the Bench stated that the High Court had not directed him to be promoted, but to review his candidature based on all material.  "The High Court has not directed his promotion, it has only directed a review to consider the material that was not placed before it." Mr. Kaushik insisted that the concerned material was before the DPC.  "It was placed before the DPC. If you peruse the minutes of DPC it would be clear." The Bench felt that UPSC had ample time to approach the High Court in review, if it was so certain that the Court had not considered the aforementioned aspect.  "You are coming against a judgment decided in 2019, in which case at that point in time filed the review that there was some material…I am not on delay. I am saying that the time period between the judgment, if you felt some material before the court had not been examined, was the time to file a review application." Mr. Kaushik asserted that his written synopsis before the High Court clearly indicated that the material was before DPC. Moreso, the minutes of the review DPC also indicated the same.  "Milords, kindly consider, if your lordships feel we can go back to the High Court even now. It was pointed out. My written synopsis clearly indicates that. The minutes of the review DPC which was before the Hon'ble Court themselves reflect." The Bench asked Mr. Kaushik to show from the documents, the fact that the material was indeed placed for consideration of the Court -  "According to the High Court, what you were required to place before the Committee was the initial ACR, representation of the Respondent and the upgradation document. Please show us that this was placed." Responding to the Bench's query, Mr. Kaushik read from the DPC order.  The Bench enquired if the representation pursuant to which the upgradation of the Respondent No. 1 took place in 2014 was also before the DPC.  "The only thing therefore is the representation which was made by the Respondent pursuant to which upgradation took place was it also placed or not placed." Mr. Kaushik submitted, "It was placed."  The Bench pointed out that the view taken by the HC that the DPC ought to have given reason for taking a different view from the competent authority who had upgraded the Respondent No. 1, was a valid one.  "The High Court has said that ..you should have put the officer on notice because it has a cascading effect. So, now you are not considering him for a promotional post. It has a civil consequence and you should have put him on notice. What is wrong with this view?" Mr. Kaushik argued that it was contrary to the principles laid down by the Supreme Court.  The Bench emphasised that if a different view was taken by DPC, then the Respondent No. 1 had to be put on notice of the same.  "No, Mr. Kaushik you are wrong because you are going on the basis that the report is not binding, maybe so, maybe the upgradation is not binding, but if you do not accept upgradation then you have to put him on notice. That is the point." Mr. Kaushik submitted that, "The assessment of the officer for promotion is not a process where the principles of natural justice are attracted." The Bench pressed on the issue of putting the Respondent No. 1 on notice.  "Are you saying, if the upgradation takes place, he knows, it is an upgradation, you can ignore the upgradation without informing him?" Mr. Kaushik responded, "No, Milords. It is not lowering the upgradation." Referring to the judgment of the High Court, the Bench noted -  "The High Court says that the CA [Competent Authority] having recorded the above reason for increasing for Petitioner‟s grade points, it was incumbent upon the DPC to supply reasons for differing with it in this regard."  Mr. Kaushik argued that the DPC had given reasons why the upgradation was not justified.  "Reasons are not to the letter to the officer. Kindly see UPSC v. Satyapriya. The reasons have been given by DPC. They say the records do not justify, indicate any reason for upgradation. The particular column was, did he discharge any additional function. The accepting authorities said that this was one of the incidental functions and no additional function has been given." The Bench noted that if the DPC in an independent decision based on material on record would have found the Respondent No.1 to be 'unfit', then the same would have been acceptable, but the DPC couldn't have downgraded him.  "If you come to an independent decision based on the record that he is not fit to be considered, that is a different issue. But, what you have done is downgraded him." Mr. Kaushik sought the Court's permission to read the DPC guidelines. Not inclined to permit, the Bench remarked -  "You are not able to convince us for the better part of 10 mins for a notice." Finding no merit in the matter, the Bench dismissed the same.  [Case Title: Union Public Service Commission v. Avtar Singh Arora And Ors. Dairy No. 10581 of 2021]     
The Supreme Court, on Thursday, imposed a cost of INR 50,000 on the State of Uttar Pradesh for filing a frivolous appeal pertaining to payment of death-cum-retirement gratuity to the wife of a deceased professor. A Bench comprising Justice M.R. Shah and Justice B.V. Raganathna deplored the practice of filing frivolous appeals by State Governments before the Apex Court.  “We deprecate the practice of a State filing such cases before the Apex Court. Hence the appeal is dismissed with cost of Rs. 50,000/- payable by the appellant to the respondent within a period of four weeks from today.” One Dr. Vinod Kumar was working as Lecturer in a Government College in Uttar Pradesh. In 2009, he died while in service. Priyanka, his wife (original petitioner) applied for payment of gratuity due to Kumar. The Government rejected her claim stating that, while in service, her husband had not opted to retire at 60 years. A petition was filed before the Allahabad High Court, which was allowed. The State was directed to compute the amount payable to her husband towards gratuity with interest @ 8% p.a. The appeal by the State before the Division Bench of the High Court met with the same fate.  The Bench noted that Kumar was born on 1.7.1951; he would have completed 60 years on 30.06.2011. On 16.09.2009, a Government Order (GO) was issued according to which he could have exercised his option to retire at the age of 60 years, on or before 1.7.2010. However, he passed away prior to the stipulated period and there was no chance for him to exercise the option enumerated in the 2009 GO. It upheld the orders of the Court below. It further noted -  “The death- cum-retirement gratuity is the benevolent scheme and the same is extended to the respondent being heirs/dependent of the deceased employee by the learned Single Judge, confirmed by the Division Bench. In the facts and circumstances of the case, no interference of this Court is called for.” [Case Title: State of U.P. And Ors. v. Smt.

The Karnataka High Court has said that an acquittal order cannot be passed by the trial court under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, for non-appearance of the complainant while recording plea of accused.  A single judge bench of Justice P N Desai sitting at Kalaburagi allowed the petition filed by Nagaraj and restored the prosecution before Additional Civil Judge.  The bench said,  "For non-appearance of the complainant on each and every date of hearing, an order of acquittal cannot be passed in every case. The Court has to see the stage of the case and the previous appearance of the accused and complainant and how many years the complaint is pending and what is the nature of the case before passing any such dismissal order. Simply to dispose of the cases or get rid of the case, the complaint cannot be dismissed when there is no necessity of the presence of the complainant."   Case details:  A complaint came to be lodged by the appellant under Section 138 of N.I.Act in 2013. The present respondent who is accused did not appear before the Court for several years and NBW came to be issued. Thereafter, in 2018, the accused appeared and got himself released on bail. When the matter was posted for recording plea of accused, JMFC dismissed the complaint for non- appearance of the complainant.  The appellant filed a revision petition against said dismissal order, which was allowed and the complaint was restored to its original file. Against that order, respondent/accused filed a criminal petition which came to be allowed. Following which, instant appeal was preferred.  Findings:  The bench referring to the order sheet of the trial court noted that the case was posted for recording the plea of the accused. On 15.9.2018 the accused was absent, but the court without taking into consideration all these aspects after lapse of five years of lodging the complaint, kept the case pending for want of appearance of respondent/accused but, dismissed the complaint for non-appearance of the complainant when the case was posted for recording plea of the accused.  It observed,  "The complainant's presence at the time of recording the plea of the accused is not at all essential. It is the duty of the Court to record pleas of the accused by putting substance of accusation against him. The complainant's presence is not at all essential."   Referring to section 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the bench said,  "It is evident that the Court has to exercise its discretion judiciously. The proviso clearly indicates that when the Court is of the opinion that the personal attendance of the complainant is not necessary, the Magistrate may dispense with attendance of complainant and proceed with the case."  Following which it held,  "Here the complainant is represented by an advocate. The stage of the case is for recording of a plea. The complainant's presence was not necessary and the recording plea is by the Court. It is the task to be performed by the Court for progress of the case. Therefore, when the presence of the complainant on that day is not necessary, the learned JMFC ought not to have dismissed the complaint for non-appearance of the complainant."

The Bombay High Court recently set aside a 22-year-old man's attempt to murder conviction observing that there was no premeditation as he pushed the victim from a running train in a sudden quarrel. The court convicted him under section 308 of the IPC (attempt to commit culpable homicide) instead.  "There was no premeditation and no preparation for commission of offence. The incident had taken place suddenly as a result of sudden quarrel. In that quarrel the Appellant got angry and pushed PW-1 from a running train. Therefore, his intention or knowledge cannot be stretched to conclude that he attempted to commit murder of PW-1. Though, it is proved that the injured PW 1 had suffered grievous injury, which was even dangerous to his life, the requisite intention and knowledge mentioned U/s.307 of I.P.C. is not proved. From the nature of evidence, in my view, though the ingredients of Section 307 of I.P.C. are not proved, the ingredients of Section 308 of I.P.C. are proved by the prosecution", the court held.  The court was dealing with a criminal appeal against appellant's was conviction under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC. Appellant was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 7 years and fine of Rs 3,000 by the trial court.  Till May 15, 2022 he had suffered actual imprisonment of 5 years 4 months and 8 days and was released on COVID parole.  The court considered the mitigating factors such as young age and recent marriage of the appellant and reduced the sentence to the period he had already suffered. "At the time of arrest, the Appellant was hardly of 22 years old. He was recently married and was blessed with a child only a few days before the incident. These are the mitigating circumstances in deciding the quantum of sentence", the court stated.  The prosecution's case was that the injured Nandakumar Joshi was travelling in a bogie for handicapped persons in a local train to Kasara. There was a quarrel with the appellant who was standing at the door. The quarrel led to a scuffle between the appellant, Joshi and other passengers and he pushed Joshi from the running train.  The court perused the witness testimonies before the trial court and concluded that the witness statements are consistent regarding the major aspects. There are minor discrepancies but the incident as a whole is consistently deposed by them, the court said.   The court said that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that there was a quarrel between the injured and the appellant. There was a scuffle between the appellant and the other passengers and the appellant deliberately pushed the injured down from a running train.  The court noted that according to the medical evidence, the injuries suffered by Joshi were grievous and dangerous to his life. These injuries are possible from a running train and since the appellant pushed him, he has caused these injurious.  Therefore, the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that in the quarrel and scuffle, the appellant deliberately pushed the injured from the running train causing grievous injury, the court held.  However, the court said that the prosecution's evidence is lacking with respect to section 307 of the IPC. The appellant did not know the injured and there was no premeditation for the offence.   However, the court said that the prosecution has proved ingredients of section 308 of the IPC. While there was no premeditation, "the Appellant had pushed the injured from a running train, therefore, he can be attributed knowledge that his act was endangering to life of the PW-1. Therefore, his act would fall within the meaning of Section 308 of I.P.C.", the court held.  Considering the injuries caused to the injured, the court said that maximum punishment is not required in this case and reduced the sentence to the period he has already undergone imprisonment.  Case no. – Criminal Appeal No. 128 of 2018  Case title – Mohammad Azad Alam Diljad Ansari v. State of Maharashtra    
The Supreme Court on Friday recorded the undertaking made by the State of Maharashtra that if permission is granted for Sakal Hindu Samaj for holding its proposed meeting at Mumbai on February 5, it will be subject to the condition that "nobody will make any hate speech and act in defiance of law or disturb the public order". Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta made this undertaking before a bench comprising Justices KM Joseph and JB Pardiwala which was hearing a petition seeking to ban the proposed meeting of the organisation. Citing alleged instances of anti-Muslim hate speech during the 'Hindu Jan Aakrosh Morcha' held by the Sakal Hindu Samaj in Mumbai on January 29, the petitioner Shaheen Abdullah sought the Court's intervention, apprehending the repeat of similar incidents. Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that the police should invoke Section 151 of Code of Criminal Procedure-which gives power to the police to arrest persons to prevent cognizable offences- as regards the organisers, having regard to the events in the previous meeting. SG Mehta opposed this demand of the petitioner. The bench recorded in order as follows : "We also direct that the officers, in case permission is granted and in case the occasion arises for invoking power under Section 151, it shall be the duty of the officers concerned to invoke the mandate of Section 151". Further, accepting Sibal's demand that the meeting should be videographed and a report should be given to the Court, the bench issued a direction to that effect to the police inspector of the area. The contents of the video should be made available to the Court. The bench also directed the Solicitor General to get instructions from the State on the allegations made by the petitioner regarding the January 29 meeting of the organisation. During the hearing, the SG stoutly opposed the petition by saying that the petitioner was "selectively" taking up causes though he is claiming to be a "public spirited citizen". Mehta also questioned why a petitioner from Kerala was concerned about an event proposed in Maharashtra. "Now selective cases are being filed here. Can this august forum be abused like this? ", SG asked. "Now individuals are selectively choosing and coming to this court, saying ban this event in Uttarakhand, ban that event in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra. Can this Court be converted into an authority which grants permissions for meetings? ", he asked. While undertaking that action will be taken against hate speech, the SG questioned the demand to stop the event, saying that it will amount to "pre-speech censorship". Sibal said that during the meeting held on last Sunday, grave statements were made by the participants, including an MP of the ruling party and these factors should be considered before deciding to allow the next meeting. "The conduct of last Sunday must be considered before permission is granted", Sibal said. According to the petitioner, calls for social and economic boycott of Muslims were made during the previous meeting. SG said that it will be impossible for the authorities to vet the proposed speeches. "The petitioners are seeking not only pre-speech censorship but also pre-speech arrest", SG stated in respect of Sibal's reliance on Section 151. SG said that the Court will be "pre-judging" that hate speech will take place, if directions to invoke Section 151 CrPC are passed. Regarding the direction that police should record video of the event, the SG did not oppose, but said "ideally the public spirited people should record, who come selectively and abuse this Court's jurisdiction". "Do you think petitioners will be permitted to do videography? ", Justice Joseph asked in response. Case Title : Shaheen Abdullah vs Union of India  For Petitioner(s) Mr. Kapil Sibal, Sr. Adv.

Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not apply to the institution of civil suit in the Civil Court, the Supreme Court said in a judgment on Friday (21 Jan 2022) The court observed thus while setting aside a judgment passed by the NCDRC in which it observed that the complainant would be at liberty to seek remedy in the competent Civil Court. The Commission further observed that if he chooses to bring an action in a Civil Court, he is free to file an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The commission also recorded the statement of counsel for the SBI that it will not press the issue of limitation if action is brought by the complainant in a Civil Court.  "Such an observation/order passed by the National Commission is in utter ignorance of the provisions of the Limitation Act, in as much as Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not apply to the institution of civil suit in the Civil Court.", the court said. Section 5 of the Limitation Act provides that an appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure may be admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period. Section 2(l) of the Act clarifies that a  "suit" does not include an appeal or an application. In this case, the complainant had filed the consumer case before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Purba Medinipur alleging inter-alia that the opposite party i.e., Sunil Kr. Maity had a saving account number in a bank since January, 2000. On 24.02.2010, the said account number was changed. On 15.09.2012, the complainant went to deposit a sum of Rs. 500/- in the said account, when a staff of bank informed him that the account number had again been changed and wrote a different account number on his passbook. The said amount was deposited in the said account number. Thereafter, on 16.01.2013, the complainant deposited a cheque for Rs. 3,00,000/- drawn on SBI of the said Branch issued by one Prabir Pradhan having an SBI account number 030608507950. When the complainant went to update his passbook on 11.12.2013, he noticed that his passbook showed the balance of Rs. 59/- only, though he had not made any transaction between 16.01.2013 to 11.12.2013. On the enquiry having been made, the bank informed the complainant that there was another customer by the name Sunil Maity  whose account number  account number was wrongly given to the complainant whose name. The said Sunil 3 Maity withdrawn the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- and Rs. 2,00,000/- respectively from the said account number. The complainant therefore wrote letters to the bank and thereafter filed the complaint before the Consumer Forum against the SBI and the said Sunil Maity. This complaint was allowed by the Consumer Forum against which an appeal was preferred by the bank before the State Commission (SCDRC). The SCDRC upheld the order of the Consumer Forum except to the extent of fine imposed. Therefore, the bank approached the NCDRC by filing revision petition. Allowing the petition, the NCDRC dismissed the complaint with liberty to the complainant to approach a competent civil court as per the law. Challenging this order, the Complainant approached the Apex court. The Apex Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of NCDRC.         
The Supreme Court, recently, held that in cases of overlapping insurance policies, when the defined loss of the insured is fully indemnified by one insurer, the second insurer is not liable for the claim towards the same incident. "A contract of insurance is and always continues to be one for indemnity of the defined loss, no more no less. In the case of specific risks, such as... The Supreme Court, recently, held that in cases of overlapping insurance policies, when the defined loss of the insured is fully indemnified by one insurer, the second insurer is not liable for the claim towards the same incident.  "A contract of insurance is and always continues to be one for indemnity of the defined loss, no more no less. In the case of specific risks, such as those arising from loss due to fire, etc., the insured cannot profit and take advantage by double insurance." A Bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and P.S. Narasimha allowed appeal assailing the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which directed the insurance company to pay Rs. 1.78 crores towards the claim raised by the insured. While opining that the insurance company was not liable to pay, the Apex Court noted that in the present case the issue was that of 'double insurance'/'overlapping policy', wherein the entity seeks coverage of risks of the same or similar incidents from two insurance policies.  Factual Background  United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (insurer) issued a Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy (SFSP Policy) to Levis Strauss (India) Pvt. Ltd. (insured) covering its stock in storage, first for a period of 01.01.2007 to 31.12.2007 and then 01.01.2008 to 31.12.2008. Levis Strauss & Co., the parent company of the insurer obtained a global policy (STP Policy) from Allianz Global Corporate & Speciality (Allianz) for the period of 01.05.2008 to 30.04.2009. It covered stocks of all its subsidiaries, including the insurer. Another 'all risks' policy (AR Policy) was issued by Allianz for the period of 01.05.2008 to 01.05.2009 covering stocks of its subsidiaries across the globe.   On 13.07.2008, fire broke out in one of the warehouses containing the stocks of the insured. On 18.07.2008, the insured claimed Rs. 12.20 crores from the insurer. Subsequently, on 11.09.2009, the insurer repudiated the claim stating that Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy, excludes liability for loss payable under marine policy i.e. STP Policy. The insured approached the NCDRC, which allowed its complaint, without deciding whether the STP policy was a marine policy. On perusal of Clause 47 of the STP Policy, it noted that the said policy excludes the extent covered by the domestic policy. It held that though the loss of profit which the insured would have earned on the sale of the damaged stock was payable by Allianz, the loss suffered to the extent of cost of the goods would be payable by the insurer. It allowed the claim to the extent of Rs. 1.78 crores as the insured had received 19.52 crores from Allianz.  Contentions raised by the appellant  Advocate, Mr. A.K. De, appearing on behalf of the insurer, submitted that the foreign policy, i.e., STP Policy covered fire risk to the stock while in transit and also in store and elsewhere. He assailed the interpretation of Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy and Clause 47 of the STP Policy by NCDRC to hold that loss caused to goods was covered by SFSP Policy while STP Policy covered loss of earnings. It was asserted that the loss suffered being a composite one could not have been bifurcated. Mr. De highlighted that the claim was for Rs. 12.4 crores, against which it received Rs. 19.52 from Allianz. Therefore, he argued that the insured had received more money than admitted loss.   Contentions raised by the respondent  Senior Advocate, Mr. Joy Basu, appearing on behalf of the insured, submitted that under Section 2(c)(b) of the Insurance Act, 1938 and Section 25 of the Nationalisation Act there is an obligation to arrange insurance through a domestic insurer. It was pointed out that the insured was under a contractual obligation to get its risk covered under a domestic policy and under Clause 47 of the STP Policy, the primary obligation was on the domestic insurer. He submitted that the coverage under the two policies were mutually exclusive - SFSP Policy expressly excluded loss other than manufacturing as a result of fire; which was covered by the STP Policy. If not so, then it would indicate that the insurer was collecting premia without any liability.   Analysis of the Supreme Court  STP Policy is a marine policy  Section 4 of the Marine Insurance Act, 1963 postulates that a contract of marine insurance may, by its express terms, or by usage of trade, be extended so as to protect the assured against losses on inland waters or on any land risk which may be incidental to any sea voyage. Referring to a catena of judgments, the Court noted that marine insurance policies in India include warehouse risks, combined with voyage and other marine risks. The STP policy also stipulates that it covers both marine and other risks. Moreover, the Policy describes itself as, 'Open Marine Insurance Contract'. It observed that the policy includes marine perils and is therefore a marine cover.   As per Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy, the insurer was not liable to pay The Court noted that Condition No. 4 of the SFSP Policy stated that in the event of occurrence of an insurance risk, if the insured was entitled to claim under a marine policy, the insurer cannot be held liable. Relying on Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. v. Garg Sons International (2014) 1 SCC 686; Vikram Greentech India Ltd v New India Assurance Co. (2009) 5 SCC 599; Sikka Papers Ltd v. National Insurance Co (2009) 7 SCC 777; Impact Funding Solutions Ltd. v. Barrington Support Services Ltd. (2016) UKKSC 57, the Court was of the view that the party who wishes to limit its liability must do so in clear words and that the insured cannot claim more than what is covered by the insurance policy. On a strict interpretation of Condition No. 4, the Court held that the insurer had excluded its liability from the risk covered under a marine policy, which in this case was the STP Policy. The Court also noted that there was no statutory or contractual obligation on the insurer to obtain a domestic policy in the conduct of its business and therefore, NCDRC had erroneously applied Clause 47.  Double Insurance The insured had raised a claim of Rs. 12.2 crores with the insurer. Against the claim of Rs. 12.2 crores, it had already received about Rs. 19 crores from Allianz. Considering the same, the Court observed that a contract of insurance is one for indemnity of defined loss. In case of specific risks the insured cannot profit by double insurance. In this regard Castettion v. Prestton (1833) 11 QBD 380 was referred to, which had held that in case of a loss, the insured would be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully indemnified. The Court opined -  "Levi could not have claimed more than what it did, and not in any case, more than what it received from Allianz. Its endeavour to distinguish between the STP Policy and the SFSP Policy, i.e., that the former covered loss of profits, and the latter, the value of manufactured goods, is not borne out on an interpretation of the terms of the two policies. Even the facts here clearly show that Levi received substantial amounts towards the sale price of its damaged goods, over and above the manufacturing costs." Case Name: United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Levis Strauss (India) Pvt. Ltd.  Case No. and Date: Civil Appeal No. 2955 of 2022 | 2 May 2022  Coram: Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat and P.S. Narasimha  Headnotes :  Marine Policy - Section 4 of the Marine Insurance Act, 1963 - A contract of marine insurance may, by its express terms, or by usage of trade, be extended so as to protect the assured against losses on inland waters or on any land risk which may be incidental to any sea voyage - warehouse risks, combined with voyage and other marine risks, are considered as part of marine insurance policies in India(Paragraph 19).  Insurance Law - Exclusion of liability in insurance policies - as a matter of general principle, it is well established that if one party, otherwise liable, wishes to exclude or limit his liability to the other party, he must do so in clear words; and that the contract should be given the meaning it would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which is reasonably available to the person or class of persons to whom the document is addressed (Paragraph 19).  Insurance Law - Double Insurance - where an entity seeks to cover risks for the same or similar incidents through two different - overlapping policies - two or more insurers must have insured the same assured in respect of the same risk on the same interest in the same subject-matter - once the first insurer has paid a complete indemnity to the assured, the second insurer would be entitled to decline liability - in the case of specific risks, such as those arising from loss due to fire, etc., the insured cannot profit and take advantage by double insurance(Para 46 and 47).

The Karnataka High Court has set aside an order of the Sessions Court discharging a woman accused of bigamy and hatching a conspiracy with her second husband to murder her first husband.  A single judge bench of Justice Dr. HB Prabhakara Sastry observed that there is sufficient material to proceed with the trial against Mamatha R., who allegedly killed her first husband to retain a property devolved upon their minor daughter in family partition. "It is beyond any doubt or dispute that at the stage of framing of charge, the Court will not weigh the evidence. The stage for appreciating the evidence for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion as to whether the prosecution was able to bring home the charge against the accused or not would arise only after all the evidence is brought on record at the trial." A charge-sheet was filed against Mamatha for offences punishable under Sections 302 (Murder), 493, 494, 496 (Bigamy), 120-B (Criminal conspiracy) and 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) read with Section 34 of IPC.  She was said to have married one Manjunath YD, also an accused, during the period her first husband (now deceased) went missing. However, when the first husband returned after a span of some 1.5 years and demanded custody of their daughter, the duo allegedly hatched a conspiracy to cause his death. The trial Court had allowed Mamatha's application for discharge on the ground that investigation was improper, the offence of Bigamy (non-cognizable) cannot be investigated by the Police and no tangible material has been brought on record to show any criminal conspiracy. Findings  Upon a perusal of the chargesheet and witnesses statements recorded by the police, the Court noted that prosecution had produced ample material to prosecute prosecute Mamatha for the offence punishable under Section 494 IPC. "When a complaint comprises both cognizable and non-cognizable offences, the investigating agency i.e., the police are required to treat all the offences cognizable and proceed to investigate the case and to submit the charge sheet for all the offences, cognizable or non-cognizable both, provided it is found by the police during investigation that offences alleged prima facie have been committed." So far as the offence of Murder is concerned, the Court observed that even though none of the chargesheet witnesses alleged any direct overt act against Mamatha, however, the allegations w.r.t. retention of partition property attributes "mens rea" and thus, it is only during the course of the trial that the conspiracy, if any, between the accused can be established by the prosecution. "Since it is observed above that there are sufficient materials to proceed with the trial against Mamatha R., (original accused No.3), the Sessions Judge's Court was at error in allowing her application filed under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. and discharging her from the alleged offences. As such, the said order deserves to be set aside and her application filed under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. deserved to be dismissed."  Case Title: K.C.Ramu @ Ramanna v.

The Karnataka High Court has held that only 'Indian Citizens' can initiate proceedings under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.  A Single Judge bench of Justice P. Krishna Bhat said,  "It is evident that one of the essential elements for being designated a 'Senior Citizen' for the purposes of the Act is the person being an Indian citizen."  The petitioner Mrs Dephny Gladys Lobo had approached the court seeking to quash the proceedings initiated by Assistant Commissioner and President, Senior Citizen Maintenance Tribunal, Managlore based on the complaint filed by Carobina Ferrao Gurein, a permanent resident of United Kingdom.  The court said, "The passport of respondent No.2 is produced at Annexure-B. It shows that respondent No.2–Carobina Ferrao Guerin is a British citizen. Her photograph is also affixed to the passport. It is therefore evident that she is not an Indian citizen as the Constitution of India does not provide for dual citizenship."  The court referred to Section 2 (h) of the Act which defines 'Senior Citizen' and it reads as follows: "senior citizen" means any person being a citizen of India, who has attained the age of sixty years or above.  Following which the court held, "The passport at Annexure-B clearly shows that respondent No.2 at whose instance proceedings has been initiated by the respondent No.1, is not an Indian citizen. In that view of the matter, respondent No.1 had no jurisdiction to initiate the proceedings under the Act. Accordingly, the same is liable to be quashed."  Case Title: MRS DEPHNY GLADYS LOBO v.

Ruling that time has come to initiate action against persons who file frivolous complaints under Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D IPC etc. only for an ulterior purpose, the Delhi High Court recently imposed a cost of Rs.30,000 on the petitioners with a warning not to file false and frivolous cases.  The Bench of Justice Subramonium Prasad sternly remarked that it is now becoming a trend to register FIRs alleging offences under Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D IPC either to force a party from withdrawing a complaint instituted against them or to arm-twist a party.  It may be noted that S. 354 of IPC deals with the offence of Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty, S. 354-A relates to the offence of Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment, S. 354B is related to the offence of Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe, S. 354C deals with the offence of Voyeurism and S. 354D deals with Stalking.  The matter before the Court   CRL.M.C. 533/2021 & 534/2021 were filed for quashing FIR No.239/2017 and 238/2017 (both registered alleging offence under Sections 509, 506, 323, 341, 354, 354A and 34 IPC) respectively and the Complainant in FIR No. 238/2017 happened to be the accused in FIR No.239/2017.  It was submitted that with the intervention of some common friends, relatives and family members, the parties have settled their dispute and an oral settlement has been reached between the parties.   It was also stated that both the parties, the petitioners and respondents in CRL.M.C. 533/2021 and CRL.M.C. 534/2021, have realised their mistake and they had decided to compromise the matter.  As per the said oral settlement, the parties agreed that they would approach the Court for the quashing of the abovementioned FIRs and thus, it was requested that the FIRs be quashed as the dispute had been amicably resolved.  Court's observations  At the outset, the Court noted that offences under Sections 354, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D IPC are serious offences and that such allegations have the effect of tarnishing the image of the person against whom such allegations are made.   Further, the Court opined that allegations regarding these offences cannot be made at a drop of a hat. This practice is an abuse of the process of law.   About the instant case, the Court noted that it is a 'classic example' as to how frivolous allegations of Section 354 and 354A have been levelled by the parties against each other.   The Court observed that a small fight regarding parking was escalated by levelling allegation of outraging the modesty of women.   "This court can take judicial notice of the fact that the police force is very limited. Police personnel have to spend time in investigating frivolous cases. They have to attend court proceedings, prepare Status Report etc. The result is that investigation in serious offences gets compromised and accused escape because of shoddy investigation", remarked the Court.  However, in view of the mutual settlement arrived at between the parties, the Court was satisfied that no useful purpose will be served in prosecuting with the present proceedings.   Resultantly, the FIR No.238/2017 and FIR No.239/2017 and the proceedings emanating therefrom were quashed.   Significantly, noting that the Police had to spend valuable time in investigating the offence and considerable time was spent by the Court in the criminal proceedings initiated by the parties, the Court thought it fit to impose a cost on the petitioners with a warning not to file false and frivolous cases.   Thus, the petitioners in both CRL.M.C. 533/2021 & CRL.M.C.534/2021 were directed to deposit a sum of Rs.30,000/-(Rupees Thirty Thousand Only) with 'DHCBA Lawyers Social Security and Welfare Fund' within three weeks.

The criminal justice system of ours can itself be a punishment, remarked the Supreme Court in its order disposing a criminal appeal which was filed 13 years ago. The bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Abhay S. Oka observed thus after it noted that an appeal arising out of framing of charges remained pending in the Supreme Court for 13 years. The court was dealing with a case where a student committed suicide following a disciplinary action initiated by the school management against him. A charge sheet was filed against the teacher, the Head of the Department and the Principal on the complaint filed by student's father that the suicide was instigated by them. The Trial Court framed charges against the accused in the year 2009. The accused preferred criminal revision petition before the High Court which was dismissed by observing that the proceedings were at an early stage and did not call for any interference. The accused thus approached the Apex Court which granted interim stay in the year 2009. "The present appeals were preferred assailing that order and interim stay was granted at the threshold. The trial of course naturally did not proceed in view of the stay by this Court. The matter has rested at that for the last thirteen years!", the bench noted in the order disposing of the appeal after 13 years. The bench began the order with these remarks: "The criminal justice system of ours can itself be a punishment! It is exactly what has happened in this case. 14 years on an issue of abetment of suicide in an episode where a student was reprimanded for misconduct in the College and on endeavor to take disciplinary action and call the father, though the parent did not turn up and subsequently the child committed suicide. An unfortunate situation." The bench considered the appeal and noted that even reading of the charge sheet, on the basis of the complaint as it is, there is still no case made out for abetment of suicide. The appeal was finally allowed discharging the accused. This aspect of the order is dealt in this report. Case details V.P.

While we appreciate the anguish of a father who has lost a young son, that cannot result in blaming the world (in the present case, the institution and its teachers) for what is a basic disciplinary action necessary for running the institute.

The Supreme Court, recently, endorsed the order of the Delhi High Court upholding the validity of Section 9D of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (Excise Act). A Bench comprising Justice S. Ravindra Bhat and Justice Dipankar Datta also imposed a cost on the appellant cigarette manufacturing companies for unnecessarily protracting the proceedings before the Apex Court. It issued directions to pay a cost of Rs. 5,00,000 to any charitable organisation involved in providing help, assistance and relief to children suffering from cancer. The payment is required to be made within a period of a month and within two weeks thereof the appellants are to produce proof of payment to the Registrar of the Supreme Court.  The appellants had filed writ petitions before the Delhi High Court, inter alia, challenging the validity of Section 9D of the Excise Act. Eventually, the writ petitions were dismissed. The appellants approached the Apex Court, and it remitted the matter back to the High Court for fresh consideration. The High Court considered the challenge to the vires of Section 9D of the Excise Act and found the provision was not ultra vires. Section 9D provides for relevancy of the statement made or signed by a person before any Central Excise Officer of a gazetted rank during the course of any inquiry or proceeding. Senior Advocate, Mr. S.K. Bagaria appearing on behalf of the appellants argued that when the matter was remitted for fresh consideration, the High Court could not have limited its decision only to the issue of vires of the provision. He submitted that the High Court ought to have considered the procedural lapses on the part of the department and how the parameters of Section 9D were breached. He emphasised that the High Court had erred in not deciding the other issues raised in the writ petitions.  The Bench observed that the appeals from the order of the appellate tribunal had been disposed of by the Apex Court long back and at the time of hearing of the present appeals, there are no lis pending in respect of the concerned demands. It noted that there were no pending proceedings where the principles laid down by the High Court for invocation of Section 9A of the Excise Act could be implemented. When the Apex Court had remitted the matter to the Delhi High Court, only the civil appeals from the orders of the appellate Tribunal were pending. They were remitted to the Tribunal, which decided in favour of the department. The appeals before the Apex Court challenging confirmation of the demand by the Tribunal also stood dismissed.  Background The Excise Department raised a demand of Rs. 94,00,00,000 from the appellants on the ground that they have manufactured deceptively similar versions of certain regular brands of cigarettes showing sale price though they were sold through marketing chain at a much higher price. It appears that the difference between the two prices was received by the appellants as flow-back through super wholesale buyers. In 1988, two show cause notices were issued demanding the short payment of excise duty. The notices were issued on the basis of 75 witnesses to establish recovery of higher prices than the declared price and also the flow back of additional amounts. The appellants approached the High Court. 29 witnesses were allowed to be cross examined. Most of them denied the event of flow back. The remaining statements were relied upon by invoking Section 9D of the Excise Act. The appellant had argued that the parameters of Section 9D were ignored by the department. In the meanwhile the Collector of Central Excise passed the orders.  By amending the petitions, the appellants sought to challenge the validity of the Collector’s orders, which was rejected and the appellants were asked to pursue remedy before appellate authority. However, the High Court agreed to consider the limited issue of validity of Section 9D later. Two appeals filed before the appellate authority was disposed of in favour of the department and against the appellants. The appellants approached the Apex Court. The appeals before the Apex Court were dismissed for failure to make the requisite pre-deposit. The appellate authority allowed two appeals in favour of M/s. J&K Cigarettes and M/s. Kanpur Cigarettes Pvt. Ltd. Subsequently the department approached the Apex Court in appeal. While the petitions were pending, the appellants had approached the Delhi High Court by filing the above-mentioned writ petitions.

The Supreme Court has observed in its judgment delivered on December 16 that the examination of the author of a document is not required, if they had not denied their signature on the document, but only pleaded duress in execution of the same.  "The High Court,in the impugned judgment, erred in holding that the appellant had not examined the author of the documents. Such reasoning is absolutely erroneous as in the  written statement, the respondents had not denied their signatures on the documents referred to by the appellant but pleaded duress in executing of these large number of documents", the Court's judgment stated. The Supreme Court also reiterated that the onus to prove that a transaction is sham, bogus and fictitious is on the person who makes such a claim.  A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian allowed an appeal assailing the order passed by the Division Bench of Delhi High Court setting aside the decree of the Single Judge for the sum of Rs. 96,41,765.31 along with simple interest @ 15% p.a., from the date of institution of suit till the payment of the principal amount.  Factual Background The appellant filed a recovery suit for a sum of Rs. 96,41,765.31. The Single Judge of the Delhi High Court allowed the suit and passed a decree for the sum along with simple interest. It was eventually set aside by the Division Bench on the ground that the appellant had failed to establish that it was a registered dealer with the Sales Tax Authorities in Delhi and therefore, it could not have sold papers in Delhi without paying Central Sales Tax. Appellant's/Plaintiff's case The appellant manufactured writing and printing papers which were sold to customers through wholesalers. The appellant sold its products against direct payment or payment by means of hundies. The respondent no. 1, its wholesaler dealer in Delhi, which purchased paper from its Delhi Sales Office and its mills in Saharanpur, lifted a stock of about Rs. 15-20 lakh per month. The sale made to the respondent no. 1 was through limited credit of 45-60 days as well as hundi. Interest was charged after fifteen days from the date of delivery. The rate of interest was 21% p.a., from the date of delivery till the date of payment along with penal interest of 3%. As a wholesaler, the respondent no. 1 got a trade discount amounting to Rs. 700-750 per ton.  For the stock lifted during the period from November, 1985 to January, 1986, the respondent no. 1 did not make the due payments against the 189 consignment worth Rs. 72,27,079 received by it. Moreover, the hundies for 9 consignments worth Rs. 2,99,480 were also dishonoured. Therefore, the claim of the appellant stood at Rs. 96,41,765.31 (principal amount Rs. 71,82,266+Interest on outstanding bill Rs. 24,59,499.31). By way of an affidavit, the appellant tendered 976 documents including stamped and signed invoices, delivery challan, deposit notes, ST-1 form etc. In cross-examination the appellant clarified that in sale transactions by manufacturer with wholesaler, the sales tax was exempted, but sale transactions directly between the manufacturer and customer would be taxed.  Respondents'/Defendants' case The appellants had adduced bills based on fictitious transactions, which are void in law. It was in fact the appellant who owed Rs. 45 lakh to the respondents. The respondents also alleged that the appellant had coerced them to sign documents and on the basis of the same had indulged in tax evasion. As the sale directly made from Saharanpur would be levied with a sales tax of 4%, the appellants used to take out the goods from the Mill in the name of the respondents and would sell it from appellant's Delhi depot in the open market at a higher profit.  By way of an affidavit, the respondents had vouched that they could not adduce their book of account as they were spoiled by torrential rains and were eaten by pests. The receipt of goods and the signature on delivery challans were denied. It was alleged that the ST-1 Forms and certain other documents were signed under duress.  Contention raised by the appellant  It was argued that neither the respondents disputed the sales tax registration of the appellant, nor was an issue framed in this regard. However, the Division Bench had set aside the decree on the basis of non-registration under the Sales Tax Act. The Court was apprised that a registration certificate was filed by the appellant which made it clear that it was registered as a dealer under Section 14 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975.  Contention raised by the respondent Placing reliance on Subhra Mukherjee and Another v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. and Others (2000) 3 SCC 312, it was contended the onus of proof that the transaction was genuine was on the appellant, which it had failed to establish. Citing Ishwar Dass Jain v. Som Lal (2000) 1 SCC 434, it was averred that the appellant did not place books of accounts, but only extracts which would not be admissible in evidence.  Analysis of the Supreme Court  The documents were proved by the appellant  The Court observed that each invoice had the sales tax registration number and the same were stamped and signed by the respondents. The debit notes and ST-1 forms were also stamped and signed by the respondents. The Court noted that it was the respondents who had claimed that the transactions were fictitious and fraudulent, therefore the onus was on them to establish the same. It was further emphasised by the Court, that the appellant had indeed proved the documents maintained in regular course of business by a witness. Proper application of the Subhra Mukherjee judgment  On a perusal of the ratio in Subhra Mukherjee, the Court noted that therein it was held that a person attacking the transaction as sham has to prove it. Therefore, it opined that in the case at hand, the onus was on the respondents to show that the transaction was fraudulent, which it did not discharge.  Ishwar Dass Jain's judgment distinguished The Court emphasised that in Ishwar Dass Jain the relation between the parties were that of mortgagor and mortgagee, whereas admittedly in the present case the relationship between the appellant and the respondents was that of landlord and tenant. Moreover, the respondents could not prove rent paid by it. Admittedly, they did not have the records. "Therefore, the adverse inference had to be drawn against the respondents rather than against the appellant who are not relying upon the entries in the account books alone to maintain suit but reliance is on the invoices, debit note as well as ST-1 Form which had been issued only after the receipt of goods." The appellant is also a dealer By stating that the sales tax is not levied on transactions between two dealers as per the Delhi Sales Tax Act and Rules, the respondent had admitted that the appellant was also a dealer.  The documents were never contested by the respondents  The Court opined that the examination of the author of a document is not required, if they had not denied their signature on the document, but only pleaded duress in execution of the same. The respondents' witness in cross-examination admitted his signatures on the documents. Pertinently, the Court observed that the signature on the debit note on the basis of which the respondents were enjoying trade discounts was also disputed by them. The claim of duress, non receipt of goods, without an iota of evidence were considered by the Court to be bald statements made by the respondents.  [Case Title: M/s. Star Paper Mills Limited v. M/s.

The Supreme Court observed that a Karta of a Joint Hindu Family cannot file a consumer complaint in respect of deficiency in service on part of the Hospital/Doctor regarding the treatment given to his pregnant sister-in-law. The concept of Joint Hindu Family does not extend to the treatment of a pregnant sister-in-law, the bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian observed. In this case, a 'karta' of a Joint Hindu Family filed a consumer complaint against a clinic alleging deficiency in service regarding the treatment given to his pregnant sister-in-law Kiran Srivastava. He stated in the complaint that he availed the services for consideration on behalf of his sister-in-law, being the Karta of Joint Hindu Family. The dismissal of complaint was upheld by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Referring to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the bench noted that a complainant means any person who hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised and includes a beneficiary of services. "The brother-in-law of a pregnant woman would not be a beneficiary of any services rendered by the respondent. There is no allegation that he has paid or promised any consideration for engaging the services of the respondent. The only assertion in the complaint is that he is the 'Karta' of a Joint Hindu Family, therefore, he is entitled to file a complaint on account of the alleged deficiency of service by the respondent.", the court noted. The court added that the concept of Joint Hindu Family does not extend to the treatment of a pregnant sister-in-law.  "The appellant herein is the 'Karta' of a Joint Hindu Family. He cannot be said to be availing the services of a medical practitioner in respect of the pregnancy of his sister-in-law. The concept of Joint Hindu Family does not extend to the treatment of a pregnant sister-in-law.", the bench observed. The court noted in this case the issue of maintainability of the complaint goes to the root of the case. Thus, the appeal was dismissed.

The Supreme Court on Monday, directed Uber to apply for a license as per Section 93(1) of the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2019 within a period of 3 weeks (on or before 6th March, 2023), to continue its services as an aggregator in the State of Maharashtra. At the same time, the Court also allowed Uber to make a representation to the State of Maharashtra to ventilate its grievances with regard to the conditions imposed while granting provisional license . The bench also asked the State government to expeditiously frame the guidelines for aggregators. The matter was listed before a bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha, and Justice JB Pardiwala.  The bench was hearing Uber's challenge to March 7, 2022 order of the Bombay High Court which directed that cab aggregators should comply with Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines 2020. The Aggregator Guidelines were notified by the Central Government in exercise of its powers under Section 93(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. The High Court bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta and Justice Vinay Joshi had directed that the aggregators must apply for license by March 16, 2022 for operating in the State of Maharashtra. In April 2022, while granting an interim relief to Uber against the said order, the Supreme Court had directed status quo on the order of the Bombay High Court. This status quo order has been extended till April 20, 2023 in order to enable the petitioners to apply for a licence and for the State Government to take an appropriate decision.  The Supreme Court noted that the High Court "correctly observed" that, in view of the statutory regime which has come into force with the amendment of Section 93 by the Amending Act of 2019, no person can continue as an aggregator in the absence of a licence. The Court also referred to the order in Rapido's plea against the Maharashtra government's refusal to grant two-wheeler bike taxi aggregator license to the company. In that order too, the court had noted– "In terms of the first proviso of Section 93, the state government, while issuing the licence to an aggregator may follow such guidelines as issued by the Central government". However, the bench stated that it shall be open to Uber to submit a representation to State government. As per the order– "The state government shall within a period of two weeks of submission of representation take a view of the grievance. The state government may then take an appropriate decision. In case of any subsisting grievance, it shall be open to petitioners to move the Bombay High Court." The Court also ordered :"The State Government, which has to act as a regulator, must take an expeditious decision on the formulation of an appropriate policy, which may be embodied in terms of the rules which are framed under the Act. The decision of the State Government should be taken expeditiously so as to avoid litigation and uncertainty". The petitioner, Uber, was represented by Senior Advocate Dhruv Mehta and the State of Maharashtra was represented by Advocate Siddharth Dharmadhikari.

The State of Odisha is not large enough to merit the demand for the constitution of permanent benches outside Cuttack, the Supreme Court of India said on Monday. A Bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Abhay S. Oka was dealing with the problem of lawyers abstaining from work in several districts of Odisha over a long-standing demand for a permanent bench of the Orissa High Court in the western part of the state, at Sambalpur. Whileissuing a slew of directions to resolve the deadlock, including suspending the recalcitrant lawyers and taking strict action against the district bar associations to which they belonged, Justice Kaul also expressed concern over the intensifying demand for more permanent benches of the High Court.  Justice Kaul exclaimed, "What is the core issue? That every district wants a High Court instead of a district court? How big is the state?" He added sarcastically, "Why not raise a demand for one High Court outside each house?" "It is nothing but a display of ego to demand that a High Court bench be constituted at your doorsteps. You can have district judiciary at your doorsteps, but not a High Court. This cannot be done. Odisha is not such a big state," the Supreme Court judge remarked.  When a counsel for one of the district bar associations offered to explain the historical background that formed the basis of the demand, Justice Kaul sharply countered, "There may be historical background. States have been merged, states have been created. But look around the country. How many states have multiple benches of the High Court?" In this connection, he pointed out that many larger states like Bihar had only a single bench. "The only reason Maharashtra has three is because of the area. But where are the rest of the separate benches in the country?" the judge asked.  Justice Kaul also pointed out that e-infrastructure could be used to appropriately address the issues relating to accessibility and representation. "But you do not want to avail of these," he said. On being requested to intervene in this regard, Justice Kaul asked the agitating district bar associations to call off the protests first. "Go back, pass a resolution appealing to each and every member to resume work. Core issue or otherwise, nothing will be heard unless you call off the strike completely," Justice Kaul warned.

The Rajasthan High Court has observed that remarrying of the deceased's wife does not disentitle her from claiming compensation for death of her husband under Employees' Compensation Act, 1923. The court added that the amount of compensation awarded by the trial court looking at the young age of the deceased and number of claimants cannot be said to be unreasonable. Justice Rameshwar Vyas, while dismissing the first appeal preferred by the Insurance Company observed,  "Contention with regard to remarrying of the deceased's wife is concerned, the same does not disentitle her from claiming compensation for death of her husband. The amount of compensation awarded by the learned trial court looking to the young age of the deceased and number of claimants cannot be said to be unreasonable. There is no merit in this appeal." While dealing with the appellants' contention regarding not filing the claim under the Act of 1923, the court clarified that though claimants also had remedy under the Act of 1923 and there is no bar to file suit for compensation under the provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855. The court opined that the provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855 applies against all wrong doers including the employer. The court observed that the scope of the provisions of Fatal Accident Act, 1855 is wider than the scope of Act of 1923. The court added that Civil Courts are competent to entertain any civil dispute unless it is barred by any law. There is no bar under any provisions of law to claim compensation under the Fatal Accident Act by an employee against his employer, added the court. The court noted that it is not in dispute that the deceased was an employee of Pratibha Industries Ltd. and that the Workmen Compensation Policy issued in favour of Pratibha Industries Ltd. by the appellant – Insurance Company was in force at the time of incident. It is not in dispute that the compensation was assessed on the monthly income of Rs. 2600/- of the deceased, which is below Rs.4,000/- per month, added the court. Facts Essentially, the deceased Premaram @ Premratan was an employee in Pratibha Industries Ltd. He died on 18.6.2008, during the course of his employment, while he was doing work of removing soil from the pipeline in the ditch. The masala mixture machine fell upon him as a result of which he collapsed. At the time of his death, he was aged 25 years and earning Rs.250/- per day in lieu of labour work. At that time, defendant nos. 1 and 2 were Supervisor and Managing Director of the Pratibha Industries Ltd. The incident was reported to the police, upon which FIR under Section 302 and 287 IPC was registered. All the employees working under Pratibha Industries Ltd. were insured under the Wokmen's Compensation Act, 1923.. After trial, the learned trial court decreed the suit. Aggrieved with the same, this first appeal has been filed. Arguments The appellants' counsel submitted that the insurance company issued a policy in the category of workmen compensation for 30 employees drawing a salary less than Rs.4,000/-. He argued that since the deceased was an employee of Pratibha Industries Ltd, the dependents of the deceased had the remedy to file a claim petition under the Act of 1923. He also argued that Insurance Company is liable only under the provisions of the Act of 1923. He submitted that the wife of the deceased has remarried and is not entitled to get the compensation. He further submitted that the Insurance Company was impleaded as party respondent at a belated stage. He argued that the income of the deceased was more than Rs.4,000/- per month, whereas, the insurance was with regard to workers drawing a salary less than Rs.4,000/- per month each. He added that at the time of the incident, no security measures were provided to the employees by the employer. Therefore, he contended that the conditions of the policy have also been violated. Adv. Dhanpat Choudhary appeared for the appellants. Case Title: Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited & Anr. .v. Sharda    
On Thursday, the Supreme Court held that the Parole period has to be excluded from the period of sentence under the Goa Prison Rules, 2006 while considering 14 years of imprisonment for premature release. A Bench of Justices MR Shah and CT Ravikumar  held that if the parole period is included as part of the sentence period, then any prisoner who is influential enough may get parole several times. This is against the purpose of actual imprisonment, the Court said."If the submission on behalf of the prisoner is accepted that the period of parole is to be included while considering 14 years of imprisonment is accepted, in that case, any prisoner who is influential, may get parole a number of times as there is no distinction and it can be granted a number of times. If the submission is accepted, it may defeat the very object and purpose of actual imprisonment. We are of the firm view that for the purpose of considering actual imprisonment, the period of parole is to be excluded. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. Present SLP stands dismissed." The Bench was considering a challenge against a Bombay High Court (Goa Bench) order relating to Rule 335 of the Goa Prison Rules and Section 55 of the Prisons Act, 1894 [Extramural custody, control, and employment of prisoners]. The Court reserved its judgment in December 2022.During that hearing, Senior Advocate Siddhartha Dave made several arguments on why it's possible to consider the period of parole as part of the sentence under the Rules."The High Court, in this case, relies upon the Rules to say that parole cannot be equated to remission. We are not concerned with remission, but with the actual sentence. Your Lordships may disregard Furlough.""Furlough is a matter of right, bail is not. Normally, it should be granted, unless there are some exceptional circumstances like the gravity of the offense committed, etc", the Bench said.Furlough is a release given in cases of long-term imprisonment.Dave then relied on the Supreme Court decision in Sunil Fulchand Shah vs Union Of India And Ors which noted that the period of parole will be considered as part of the preventive detention period."Preventive detention is not the conviction, it stands on a different footing', Justice Shah said."Parole is for a fixed period, unlike bail", Dave said.The Court then pointed out the difference between Parole and Furlough - as far as the latter is concerned, one is entitled to it, every two years. Parole, however, is on an application made by the accused to get some relief, the Court said during the hearing."Lordships have to consider how bail, parole, and furlough are used. In bail, the nature of custody changes, from jail custody to private custody. It won't count...Bail and Parole have different connotations.....in Furlough, the nature of custody remains the same. Overarching custody is the same", Dave had argued."And there will not be any suspension while being released on parole. Virtually that can be the contention, yes?" Justice Ravikumar asked.Dave replied in the affirmative."According to you, parole period should be included? Don't ask for parole, then it will not be counted", Justice Shah remarked while adding that this is the practice in all states.If the submission is accepted, many accused persons who are "powerful enough" may misuse it, the Bench had pointed out."Parole powers are with the government. As my brother rightly pointed out, sometimes it is granted for a longer period, on medical grounds, because most of the accused affiliated with politics would like to be in hospitals than in jails. If your submission is accepted, then that period should be considered?", Justice Shah had asked."Parole is always for a short period. A fixed period", Dave tried to reason, post which the Court said that it would pass a detailed order.Case Title: Rohan Dhungat vs State of Goa and Ors | Diary No. 29535 - 2022 For Petitioner(s) Mr. Siddhartha Dave, Sr. Adv.

The Supreme Court reiterated the though exercise of jurisdiction under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is discretionary, it ought to be done only where strong and cogent evidence occurs against a person from the evidence before the Court. While dismissing an application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. filed by a complainant for summoning of the appellant as an additional accused, a Bench comprising Justice AS Oka and Justice Rajesh Bindal emphasised that the Court should not exercise the extraordinary power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. in a casual and cavalier manner. The Trial Court had dismissed the application, but the Allahabad High Court quashed its order and remanded the matter back for fresh consideration. With respect to the remand order passed by the High Court, the Apex Court opined -   “The High Court only recorded that reasons assigned by the trial court for rejecting the application were not sufficient. To avoid delay, it would have been proper exercise of power in case the High Court would have considered the material and opine as to whether a case was made out for summoning of additional accused.” Factual Background  A complaint was filed regarding murder of the appellant’s employee. On the basis of the complaint FIRs were registered against unknown persons. Subsequently, the wife of the deceased gave a complaint to the Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad making allegations against the appellant. During investigation the police found an eye witness to the murder whose statement was recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The police concluded the investigation and filed a chargesheet against two persons. The appellant was examined as a prosecution witness. After his statement was recorded, the complainant filed an application under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. summoning the appellant as accused. The application came to be dismissed by the Trial Court. The Allahabad High Court quashed the order of the Trial Court and remanded the matter back for fresh consideration.   Analysis by the Supreme Court  The Court noted that the law in respect to exercise of jurisdiction under 319 Cr.P.C. is well settled. It referred to the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Hardeep Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab And Ors. wherein the Court had observed that the power under Section 319 ought to be exercised sparingly and would require much stronger evidence than near probability of the accused person’s complicity. The test elucidated by the Constitution Bench is as under -  “The test that has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie case as exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to conviction.” The Court took note of the fact that there was no eye-witness to the occurrence. The one eye-witness whose statement was recorded retracted from his statement while appearing in court. He did not raise any finger at the appellant. It was observed that the material on record was not sufficient for summoning the appellant under Section 319 Cr.P.C. Moreover, the material on record was not even sufficient for convicting the charged accused; they were acquitted by the Trial Court.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently allowed the plea of bereaved parents, seeking release of 50% compensation amount that was granted towards loss of their child in a motor accident, to be released from 3 years Fixed Deposit. Justice Alka Sarin referred to the case of H.S. Ahammed Hussain vs. Irfan Ahammed, [2002(3) RCR (Civil) 563], where the Supreme Court held that the amount of compensation awarded in favor of the mothers should not be kept in a fixed deposit in a nationalized bank. In the present case, the petitioners had challenged an order passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal whereby it was directed that 50% of the compensation awarded be deposited in fixed deposits in their names for a period of three years. The further challenge was to the order dismissing the application filed by the petitioners for release of the amount directed to be deposited in the FDRs.   The petitioners contended that both the petitioners are over 40 years of age and have three other children to look after and hence the money is urgently required by them. Keeping in view the law laid down in the above referred case as well as the fact that the petitioners are over 40 years of age and have also three other minor children to look after, the present petition is allowed.  The court further set aside the order and award of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and ordered the release of the amount of compensation lying deposited in the shape of FDRs.  The order dated 12.05.2022 passed by the Tribunal is set aside and the award dated 23.09.2021 is modified to the said extent. The amount of compensation lying deposited in the shape of FDRs be released to the petitioners forthwith.  Case Title: Ayyub Khan and Anr VERSUS Pratap Gurjar and Ors.

Vikram Singh @ Vicky Walia and Jasvir Singh were convicted and sentenced to death for the offence of kidnapping Abhi Verma alias Harry, a school student, in Hoshiarpur, and killing him with an anesthesia overdose in 2005. The Supreme Court had confirmed their death sentences by dismissing their appeals in 2010 and the review petitions filed by them were dismissed in 2017. After the Mercy Petition preferred by them got rejected, they approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The said writ petition was dismissed by the High Court (single bench judgment was upheld by the division bench) and thus he approached the Apex Court by filing an SLP. Before the Apex Court, it was submitted that the mother of Vikram Singh @ Vicky Walia died on 13.11.2020 and some of the last rites including Bhog Ceremony are to be performed on 19.11.2020 and 21.11.2020 at Patiala and thus he be permitted to attend these ceremonies.  In this regard, the State Counsel submitted that there is no provision that a death convict can be released on parole. However, he suggested that he can be afforded the permission to attend the last rites and ceremonies of his deceased mother on the relevant dates from 10.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m., provided he is accompanied by the Police Escort all the time. The bench comprising Justices Uday Umesh Lalit, Vineet Saran and S. Ravindra Bhat accepted this suggestion and issued the following directives: a) Vikram Singh @ Vicky Walia, convict in Sessions Trial No. 24 of 2005 shall be allowed to attend the last rites and ceremonies of his deceased mother on 19.11.2020 and 21.11.2020 in Police Escort; b) the facility shall be available only from 10.00 a.m to 4.00 p.m. on the relevant dates and after 4.00 p.m., said Vikram Singh @ Vicky Walia shall be relodged in the concerned jail; c) the facility shall be available only for the aforesaid purpose and apart from the residential address, details of which are given here, he shall not be taken to any other place.

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday observed that non-custodial parent cannot be deprived of his right to spend quality time and enjoy the company of the children. Moreover, the children also have right to love and affection of both parents as well as grandparents. The Petitioner herein is the non-custodial parent. His father is unwell and was desirous of meeting with his grandchildren. The petitioner, non-custodial parent, stated that he has had no access to the children since June-2020. It was alleged that the previous order dated 10/03/2022 whereby the Court had allowed access on the birthday of the children was also not complied with. However, without getting into merits of the case, Justice Anuja Prabhudessai stated,  "the children also have right to love and affection of both parents as well as grandparents. This is essential for personal development and overall well-being of the children." The Single Judge permitted the Petitioner-father to four days' access to the children and referred the matter for mediation so that the parties may arrive at an amicable settlement. The mediator has been asked to submit the report preferably within six months. "The Petitioner shall take custody of the children on 14/04/2022 at 3.00 p.m. The Petitioner shall bring the children to Phoenix mall on 17/04/2022 at 11.00 a.m. and spend time together till 3.00 p.m. and hand over custody of the children to the Respondent -mother on 17/04/2022 by 3.00 p.m.," it ordered.

The Andhra Pradesh Court recently ruled that in a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C the Court cannot appreciate the evidence on record in exercise of its inherent powers.  The Criminal Petition under Section 482 of the CrPC, 1973 was filed seeking to quash the charge sheet. The petitioner who was one of the accused was undergoing prosecution for the offences punishable under Section 498A r/w 34 IPC and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.  The Petitioner's contention was that in the FIR it was only stated that the Petitioner harassed the complainant by using harsh language against her. However, in complainant's Section 161 Cr.PC statement (statement to police) it is stated that the petitioner also harassed her along with other accused by making illegal demand of additional dowry.  The Petitioner alleged that it is a deliberate improvement in her Section 161 Cr.P.C. statement which was not stated in the FIR. He prayed for quash of the said charge sheet on this ground.  Justice Chekati Manavendranath Roy ruled that the ground raised by the petitioner is not a valid legal ground for quash of charge sheet under Section 482. The bench stated as below:  "Whether the subsequent statement given by her in her Section 161 Cr.P.C statement is an improvement made subsequently or not and whether the said evidence is true or not is the matter relating to appreciation of evidence by the trial Court in the final adjudication of the case. This Court in a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C cannot appreciate the evidence on record in exercise of its inherent powers."  The Court dismissed the Criminal Petition since the ground that was urged by the petitioner pertains to appreciation of evidence of witnesses which the Court does not have power to do under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

The Madras High court recently gave a clean chit to Madurai's former Commissioner of Police, S. Davidson Devasirvatham in connection with matters pertaining to issuance of fake passports to Sri Lankan and Indian Nationals by using forged documents.  The bench of Justice GR Swaminathan observed that field enquiry police officer play the most crucial in verification process and the buck stops with the nodal officer. "Involvement of the officials above the said rank may not really arise." It remarked:  I give a clean chit to Shri.S.Davidson Devasirvatham IPS. At the same time, I compliment Shri.K.Annamalai, the State Bharatiya Janata Party President for having taken up the cause. He has played the role of a watchdog in a democracy. But for him the matter would not have come to light.  The court was hearing the plea of a man who was denied passport based on a police report that a criminal case was pending against him and that his passport was seized in that connection.   The State submitted that the petitioner had not come under the their adverse notice. The petitioner's travel agent Nazirudheen who was referred to in the police verification report was accused of a crime registered on the file of the Q Branch CID Police. Except for this relationship, there was nothing adverse to the petitioner. Thus, the state had no objections to allowing of the petition.   Apart from granting the prayer of the petitioner, the court also deemed it fit to consider the crime in question. The crime was registered based on information that one Vaidyanathan had conspired with unknown public servants and others at Madurai and Trichy and had fraudulently obtained Indian passports for many Sri Lankan and Indian nationals using forged signatures. The case was registered for offences under the Indian Penal Code and the Passport Act and an inquiry was underway.  Though a PIL was filed seeking to transfer the case to the CBI, a division bench had instead directed the Q Branch of CID to complete the investigation within three months. This time limit was later extended. However, the final report was still not filed.   Justice Swaminathan, therefore, directed the police to file a status report. According to the report, 41 persons were proposed to be prosecuted including officials from the Regional Passport Office and State police officials. The central government had given sanction only with respect to one of its servants and declined for 13. The state government had also granted sanctions with respect to the then Assistant Commissioner of Police, Intelligence Section, and other officers. It was informed to the court that the final report will be filed before the Judicial Magistrate shortly. The court directed the Magistrate to handle the matter expeditiously as the issue had serious national security implications.   Explaining the process of passport verification and the role of the various officers involved in it, the court opined that there are four logins for the police at various levels:  One for the field inquiry police officer.One for the SHO.One for the District / City Police.One for the DSP/ACP (authorized by SP/COP) who acts as the nodal officer for passport verification.  The court noted that the buck stops with the nodal officer and that the involvement of officials above that rank may not arise. In the present case, the controversy arose due to a delay in filing the final report, in not adhering to the time limit fixed by the division bench, and delay in granting sanctions.   Thus, the court made the above remarks and allowed the petition.  Case Title: Sureshkumar v.

The Banglore Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) headed by N.V. Vasudevan (Vice-President) and B.R. Baskaran (Accountant Member) has ruled that the capital gain exemption cannot be denied to the wife for the mere presence of the husband's name in the purchase document. The appellant/assessee is an individual, and she filed her return of income for the year under consideration, declaring a total income of Rs. 9,06,860. The assessee had earned long-term capital gain on the sale of land and claimed exemption under section 54F of the Income Tax Act from it to the extent of Rs. 1,56,33,870. The assessee offered a net long-term capital gain of Rs. 51,355.  The AO examined the long-term capital gain declared by the assessee. It was noticed that the assessee, along with 3 other persons, had sold a property for a consideration of Rs. 5.35 crores. The assessee's share of the consideration was Rs. 1,60,50,000/-. The assessee claimed that she had purchased a residential house property in a project named "M/s. Prestige Ozone" for a sum of Rs. 1,72,29,993/-. Accordingly, she claimed a deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act to the extent of Rs. 1,56,33,870.  The AO examined the details of the purchase of the property at Prestige Ozone. The AO noticed that the initial agreement was entered into by the assessee's husband, Y.C. Rami Reddy, with M/s Prestige Properties for the construction of a building at a cost of Rs. 46,35,610. Subsequently, a sale deed was registered for the purchase of plot No.8, having an extent of Rs.6,108 sq.ft. for a consideration of Rs.39,67,933, on which the construction has happened. The sale deed was executed in favour of Y.C. Rami Reddy and the assessee. The assessee claimed that she had reimbursed all the payments made by her husband to him and she had also incurred further expenses for interior design, etc. Accordingly, the assessee claimed that the entire cost of purchase was met by her, and the property was purchased by her from her husband.  The AO examined the claim of the assessee for a deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act. The AO took the view that the assessee was not eligible for a deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act on the grounds that she had already held a 50% share in the Prestige Ozone building and, hence, there was no necessity for her to pay the full consideration of Rs. 1.72 crores to her husband.  The assessee challenged the order of the AO before the CIT (A). The CIT (A) held that the expenditure incurred on interiors, renovation, furnishing, etc. after the registration of the plot, i.e., after 24.2.2007, cannot be taken as part of the cost of acquisition. On October 27, 2007, the assessee purchased only 50% of the rights from her husband, and she already held 50%.The release deed given by the husband of the assessee was registered on 25.1.2010, which is 3 years from the date of the sale of the original property. Accordingly, the CIT (A) took the view that, irrespective of the amount of payment made to her husband, the assessee can be said to have acquired only 50% of the property on 25.1.2010, which falls within 3 years from the date of sale of the original property. As a result, he concluded that the deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act should be limited to 50% of the cost of acquiring an asset.  The issue raised was whether the CIT (A) was justified in ignoring expenditure of Rs.81,71,910/- incurred on the new house property for computing deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act.  The ITAT observed that the assessee's husband had advanced money initially. Subsequently, the assessee has reimbursed the money to her husband, and finally, it was the assessee who actually gave funds for the acquisition of the property.   "We notice that the CIT (A) has taken the view that the funds given by the assessee should not be taken into account and, in our view, the said view of the CIT (A) is not, in our view, correct in law," the tribunal said.  The ITAT ruled that the deduction under section 54F of the Income Tax Act only induces an assessee to make an investment in residential house property. If the assessee has given money for the acquisition of the property, either directly to the builder or as reimbursement to her husband, then the assessee should be given the benefit of a deduction under section 54F of the Act for the cost of acquisition.

The Rajasthan High Court has recently observed that the right to seek default/statutory bail accrues to the accused in the nature of an indefeasible right, only if such remedy by preferring an appropriate application has been availed of within the prescribed window from the date of expiry of total period of detention of accused person(s) under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., until filing of the charge-sheet. The Court also held that if an additional or new offence(s) are found to be made out by the investigating authority, against an accused, then the computation of the period, as laid down under Section 167 Cr.P.C. would be done afresh.  Dr. Justice Pushpendra Singh Bhati observed,  "This Court hereby observes that the right to seek default/statutory bail accrues to the accused in the nature of an indefeasible right, only if such remedy by preferring an appropriate application has been availed of within the prescribed window from the date of expiry of total period of detention of accused person(s) under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., until filing of the charge-sheet."  Essentially, an F.I.R was lodged on 16.10.2021 u/s 363 I.P.C. by one Chhoturam stating that his brother's daughter, Sumitra was abducted by the accused–petitioner along with other persons; whereafter, the petitioner was taken into custody on 19.10.2021, and remained as such for one day, until ordered to be released on 20.10.2021.  However, subsequently the petitioner was re-arrested and taken into custody. The accused-petitioner alleged that the total period of the petitioner's custody was beyond the mandated time period, as prescribed under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C.  The accused-petitioner alleged that he is also entitled to statutory / default bail, and that his right to seek the same has accrued on the ground that the period, as laid down in Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., of 90 days, was exceeded and he was kept in custody for a total period of 92 days. Through this criminal revision petition, he prayed for the court's order to be released on bail.  Notably, the court considered the following two issues and answered them accordingly: 1. Whether the Court below, in computing the total period of detention of accused person as under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. , during which the accused – applicant was in custody, was right to exclude the period during which he was previously remained in custody, and subsequently released on bail i.e. before which the additional offences against him were found to be made out by the investigating officer.  The court observed that the period of 90 days, as laid down under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., is stated to be counted when the investigation for the fresh offence(s) is started and not from the date of lodging of the FIR.  It was opined that the trial court, after appreciating relevant judicial precedents, has rightly found that the total period of detention of the accused-petitioner has to begin from 27.10.2021, until when the charge sheet was filed on 24.01.2022. And therefore, the charge sheet was rightly filed within the stipulated 90 days' time period as laid down under Section 167 (2) (a) (I) Cr.P.C, added the court.  Further, the bench also opined,  "A bare perusal of Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. reveals that under sub-section (2) (a) (I) of 167 Cr.P.C., the period of 90 days would be computed when the investigation, with regard to that particular offence(s), began. The offence under Section 363 I.P.C. would attract the application of Section 167 sub-section (2) (a) (ii) of Cr.P.C. since the maximum / upper limit period of imprisonment under the said section would be 60 days. Regardless of that fact, this Court finds that if an additional or new offence(s) are found to be made out by the investigating authority, against an accused, then the computation of the period, as laid down under Section 167 Cr.P.C. would be done afresh." 2. Whether a bail application, under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., seeking default/statutory bail, filed after the charge sheet, although the charge sheet has been filed after the expiry of the prescribed statutory time limit under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., would be maintainable.  The court noted that the utmost significance is whether the application seeking default/statutory bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. has been made before filing of the charge-sheet, or not; and the said right of the accused becomes an indefeasible right only in the circumstance that the prescribed total period has expired and the charge-sheet has not been filed. Other surrounding circumstances are however, immaterial solely with regard to such right, in such attending circumstances, added the court.  It was answered by the court that if a bail application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., seeking default/statutory bail, if filed after filing of the charge-sheet, even if the charge- sheet has been filed after expiry of the prescribed statutory time limit, under the said provision of law, would not in fact be maintainable.  Reliance was placed by the court in Sanjay Dutt v. State through C.B.I. Bombay [(1994) 5 SCC 410], wherein it was held that if the accused had made an application seeking bail under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. after the expiry of the total period laid down in the said provision, but before the chargesheet is filed, the pendency of such an application would not affect his right to seek such bail, even in case of filing of the charge sheet prior to adjudication on such application.  The counsels for the petitioner include Adv. S.S. Ladrecha with Adv. Devendra Singh, while the counsel for the respondent includes PP Gaurav Singh.  Case Title: Akheraj v. State of Rajasthan   
Taking a stern view against a father's conduct of denying his wife access to their child despite court orders, the Bombay High Court recently upheld a district court's order striking off his defence in a matrimonial dispute.  The father was violating the visitation order stating that the child did not want to meet his mother. He filed a writ petition challenging the order striking off his defence before the High Court.  After this judgment was dictated by Justice Sandeep V. Marne of the Aurangabad bench in open court, the petitioner's lawyer gave an undertaking that the petitioner would follow the order granting visitation rights to the mother. However, the court said that such an undertaking was inconsequential.  "Petitioner ought to have shown remorse before the District Court in respect of his conduct and improved upon his behaviour at least after his defence was struck off...tendering of such undertaking at a belated stage is inconsequential", the court held.  The district court granted visitation rights to the mother for two hours each Sunday. The order directed that the father not be near his son or be visible to him during the visit so that the son does not get intimidated while meeting his mother. The mother filed an application for striking off the defence of the father due to repeated violation of this order.   The district court struck off the defence of the petitioner under Order 39 Rule 11 of the CPC. It recorded that the father has been near his son during the visitation on every date. He does not allow the mother to take her son close to her. Hence, he has wilfully disobeyed the order of the district court. It also recorded that he had misbehaved in the district court.  The father applied for recall of that order and for restoration of his defence which was rejected by the district court. Hence, he approached the High Court.  Advocate Sanket S. Kulkarni for the petitioner submitted that the visitation order could not be complied with as the child does not want to meet his mother. The child should be referred to a counsellor to determine whether he wants to meet his mother. The court should not have struck off the defence of the father as the child's wish is paramount, it was submitted.   Advocate M. L. Sangit for the mother submitted that the father has repeatedly violated the visitation order. The father did not comply with the order even after the district court passed the order striking his defence. Hence, the district court has correctly struck off his defence.  The court noted that when the District Court struck off the defence of the father, there were 11 violations of the mother's visitation rights on the part of the father. The court observed that the father seems to have obstructed his child during visitation.   The father had tried to get this matter referred to counsellor and the district court had set aside that request. The court noted that the father did not challenge the order granting visitation rights, therefore the question of revisiting that order by referring the matter to a counsellor does not arise.  The court said that the order granting visitation rights has attained finality. Therefore, the petitioner could not have denied visitation rights to the mother on the pretext of disinclination of the child to meet his mother.  While the order to strike off defence is a drastic measure to be avoided by the courts, in the present case the district court has recorded that petitioner has wilfully disobeyed district court's order, the High Court observed.  It noted that even after the order striking off the defence of the petitioner, he defaulted on granting visitation rights to the mother.   The court observed that the child has grown from five years to eight years during the custody battle and said that it is unfortunate that the father is creating hurdles and preventing the mother from meeting the child.   The court further noted that the petitioner's conduct before the district court shows his lack of bona fides and observed that the petitioner seems to be trying to frustrate the order granting visitation rights in an indirect manner.  Hence, the court didn't find any error in the district court order striking off the defence of the petitioner.  Case no. – Writ Petition No. 10758 of 2022  Case title – Shardul Shamprasad Dev v. Manjiri Shardul Dev     
The Bombay High Court has granted bail to 21-year-old pharmacy student Nikhil Bhamre, who was arrested for defamatory posts allegedly aimed at NCP president Sharad Pawar.  The division bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and NR Borkar said they were granted interim relief while hearing his quashing petition filed invoking Article 226, section 482 of the CrPC and section 407 of the CrPC. The bench orally observed,  "He is a student; he is in custody since a month. We will pass an order granting him bail." The Court further ordered that no coercive action be taken against him in cases he hasn't been arrested.  Earlier, the High Court had asked the prosecutor to take instructions from the Home Department regarding the matter, adding that the "state's grace will be saved" if they voluntarily decide not to oppose his release.  Bhamre was arrested from Nashik on May 13, 2022, for posting a critical tweet against Pawar. Significantly, the post did not mention the political leader's name. He was booked under Sections 153(A) 505 (2), 506, 107, and 153 of IPC in six FIRs.   In his tweet, Bhamre wrote, "It is time to create a Nathuram Godse of Baramati for a 'Gandhi' of Baramati. Uncle, do apologize." Baramati, situated in Pune, is the hometown of Sharad Pawar.  On Tuesday, the prosecution informed the Court that there are six FIRs registered against Bhamre and he is arrested in connection with three of them.  "My instructions are that in the 1st CR, the Dindori-Nashik CR he is already released on bail. In the other two his bail pleas are rejected and he has directly approached the court," Chief Public Prosecutor Aruna Pai submitted. She added that Bhamre hadn't challenged the orders refusing him bail.   Advocate Subhash Jha assisted by Advocate Hare Krishna Mishra for Bhamre submitted that in none of these cases was a notice for appearance under Section 41A of CrPC issued to Bhamre. "In a case like this, I may not be relegated to different courts. There cannot be so many FIRs. I shouldn't have been arrested." After hearing both sides the court said it will pass a detailed order or granting him bail in two cases he was denied relief, and protection in the remaining FIRs against him. The quashing petition should be listed for hearing after three weeks, the bench ordered.  Case Title: Mr.Nikhil Shyamrao Bhamare. V/s. State of Maharashtra and another     
The Allahabad High Court has observed that the initiation of the process of proclamation or attachment proceedings under sec. 82 or 83 of Cr.PC after the filing of an anticipatory bail plea by an accused does not bar the consideration of such a bail application.With this, the Bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan granted anticipatory bail to one Manish Yadav, who is an Army personnel serving... The Allahabad High Court has observed that the initiation of the process of proclamation or attachment proceedings under sec. 82 or 83 of Cr.PC after the filing of an anticipatory bail plea by an accused does not bar the consideration of such a bail application. With this, the Bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan granted anticipatory bail to one Manish Yadav, who is an Army personnel serving in the Indian Army and has been booked in a rape case. Essentially, the bail applicant had filed an anticipatory bail application before the court below in April 2022 and the same was rejected on April 30, 2022. Thereafter, the proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. was issued by the court below on May 9, 2022, i.e., after the rejection of his anticipatory bail plea. Now, when he moved to the High Court seeking pre-arrest bail, the question before the Court was - whether he was entitled to anticipatory bail even when the Apex Court has held in several cases that a person against whom a proclamation has been issued u/s 82/83 Cr.P.C. would not be entitled to the benefit of anticipatory bail. Section 82 contemplates the procedure for issuing a proclamation against a person absconding. Section 83 talks about the attachment of property of a person absconding. Court's observations  At the outset, the Court referred to landmark rulings of the Supreme Court laying down the law that if an accused person is declared as an absconder by the competent court, he would not be entitled to get anticipatory bail. However, the Court noted that in the instant case, when the applicant had filed the anticipatory bail application before the court below, there was no proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C.  Noting that such proclamation had been issued after the rejection of anticipatory bail application of the present applicant by the court below, the Court observed that the bar to entertain anticipatory bail application after issuance of proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C. would not be attracted in the present case. The Court also noted that the proclamation order of the Court does not disclose that the investigating officer had filed an affidavit before the court concerned to convince that all prior steps which are required under the law were taken; as to whether the summons, bailable warrant and non-bailable warrant have been served upon the applicant or not; as to whether before issuing the non-bailable warrant against the present applicant the learned court below has convinced itself about the service of the summons and bailable warrants. "In the present case when the applicant filed his anticipatory bail application, he was not a proclaimed offender. His right to file such application before this court was consequential as he could have approached the High Court u/s 438 Cr.P.C. after the rejection of his application by the sessions court which was also filed u/s 438 Cr.P.C. Therefore, when the present applicant filed his application u/s 438 Cr.P.C. he was not a proclaimed offender so the bar imposed by the Apex Court entertaining anticipatory bail of the proclaimed offender would not attract in the present case." the Court observed as it ALLOWED his anticipatory bail plea.  The Court also took into account the fact that the informant/complainant had not leveled any allegation against the present applicant in the F.I.R and that he was not even named in the F.I.R.

The Orissa High Court has upheld the conviction of a person, who was sentenced to life for committing murder of his cousin-brother. While dismissing the appeal, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice Radha Krishna Pattanaik observed,  "This is not a case of mistaken identity since all the witnesses are close relations of both the accused and the deceased. The fact that the accused hits the deceased with Bala on the head clearly reveals his intention to cause the death of the deceased. This was not on the spur of the moment. The quarrel happened in the evening whereas the incident happened in the night when the deceased was sleeping and wholly unarmed. There was no need for the close relations of the accused to falsely implicate him in the homicidal death of the deceased." Factual Background:  As per the prosecution, the mother of the accused had left the house after quarrelling with his father. The accused was said to have been upset with this and threatened his father. The deceased, who happened to be the elder cousin brother of the accused, protested this act of the accused. A quarrel ensued between them. However, at that point in time, the dispute subsided and, in the evening, both the accused and the deceased took their meals in the house of the accused. The deceased slept in the verandah. At around 11.30 PM, on hearing the shout of the deceased, the Informant (P.W. 1), the father of the deceased and the uncle of the accused woke up and saw the accused standing with a Bala and his son, the deceased, lying with head injuries. P.W.1 chased the accused, who ran away throwing the Bala at the spot. The P.W. 1 lodged the report at the Bamebari Outpost. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Baral (P.W.8) was the Investigating Officer (IO), who on 14th June, 2003 at around 7 AM took down the complaint in writing, registered the case and took up investigation. On 15th June 2003, he seized the wearing apparels of the deceased and on the same day at 10.30 AM arrested the accused and seized the wearing apparels of the accused. The charge was laid against the accused for the offence under Section 302 IPC. He pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. P.W.1, spoke clearly about he having witnessed the incident. In his cross-examination, he made clear that a 'Dibiri' (a small kerosene lamp) was burning in the room and he was clearly able to recognize the accused. He also mentioned how his wife and his daughter (P.W.3) also woke up and saw the accused run away. He said "to my knowledge, there was no enmity between the accused and the deceased." Except the above sentence, nothing else emerged in the cross-examination of the informant to doubt the veracity of his testimony. It was argued that the above sentence in the cross-examination shows there was no motive for the crime. However, P.W. 3 said that "at evening, the accused being drunk came to our house and there was exchange of words between my brother and accused. Being asked by us, the accused went away to his house." Blood stains were detected on the Bala but the blood grouping and the origine could not be detected. On the basis of these evidence, the Sessions Judge, Keonjhar convicted the accused (appellant herein) for the offence punishable under Section 302, IPC and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for lie. This appeal was filed against the said judgment dated 13th July, 2006. Court's Observations:  The Court observed that clearly there was a quarrel between the deceased and the accused in the evening whereas the murder took place in the night while the deceased was sleeping. Although P.W. 3 said in the cross-examination "there was no quarrel between the accused and deceased prior to this incident", what she was referring to, it held, were incidents prior to the quarrel that took place between the accused and the deceased. The Court further held that the instant case is not a matter of mistaken identity since all the witnesses are close relations of both the accused and the deceased. Again, the fact that the accused hits the deceased with Bala on the head clearly reveals his intention to cause the death of the deceased. Therefore, this was clearly not on the spur of the moment. The quarrel happened in the evening whereas the unfortunate incident happened in the night when the deceased was sleeping and wholly unarmed. Accordingly, the Court held that there was no need for the close relations of the accused to falsely implicate him in the murder of the deceased. It found the evidence clear and cogent and hence, the Court found no reason to interfere with the trial court's judgment. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed. Case Title: Baisakhu Sethy @ Behera v. State of Odisha   Case No. 
The Allahabad High Court has observed that matrimonial dispute between the husband and wife should be quashed when the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themself through a compromise deed duly filed and verified by the Court. The Bench of Justice Chandra Kumar Rai observed thus as it quashed criminal proceedings initiated by an FIR lodged by the wife against the husband and his family members under Sections 498-A, 323 IPC, and Section 3/4 of D.P. Act The Court ordered this as it took into account the compromise deed executed in March 2021 between both the parties, which was also duly verified and sent to the High Court along with a verification report by the lower court. Essentially, before the Court, the applicants (husband and his family members) submitted that the proceeding of a criminal case under Sections 498-A,323 IPC, and Section ¾ of D.P. Act be quashed as parties to dispute have entered into compromise which have been verified also by courts below.  It was further submitted that applicant No.1 (Husband) and opposite party No.2 (Wife) along with their children are living together as such no useful purpose will be served to drag the proceedings further. In view of this, the Court perused the judgments of the Apex Court in the cases of Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and another (2012) 10 Supreme Court Cases 303, Narinder Singh and others Vs.State of Punjab and other (2014) 6 Supreme court cases 466 and State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Laxmi Narayan and others (2019) 5 Supreme court cases 688. Further, the Court remarked thus: "Considering the facts of the present case as well as the principle of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court as mentioned above, matrimonial dispute between the husband and wife should be a quashed when the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themself through compromise duly filed and verified by the Court. There is another aspect of the case that F.I.R. has been lodged under Sections 498-A, 323 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, which will come under category specified in para No.29.4 laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in Narinder Singh (supra) and in category specified in para No.15.1 laid down by Apex Court in State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Laxmi Narayan and others (supra) regading which proceedings relating to matrimonial dispute can be quashed in exercise of power under Section-482 Cr.P.C." Consequently, the proceeding of cognizance order and charge sheet under Sections 498-A, 323 of IPC and 3/4 of D.P. Act in the instant case including the entire proceedings of the case were quashed.

While upholding an order of detention passed by an Executive Magistrate, the Supreme Court has explained the scheme of Chapter VII of the Code of Criminal Procedure which contains provisions relating to bond for keeping peace and good behaviour and also the consequences flowing from the breach of such bond. The Court explained the provisions as follows : Chapter VIII of Cr.P.C. confer powers to the Executive Magistrate to take bond for maintaining security and for keeping the peace and good behaviour by the citizens.  As per Section 107 Cr.P.C, on receiving the information, that any person is likely to commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquility or to do any wrongful act, the Executive Magistrate may have power to show cause on violation of the terms of the bond so executed for maintaining peace.  As per Section 108 of Cr.P.C., similar power has been given for maintaining the security for good behaviour from persons disseminating seditious matters. Similarly, to take security for good behaviour. from suspected persons and habitual offenders, powers under Sections 109 and 110 Cr.P.C. have been conferred upon the Executive Magistrate. On violation, recourse, specified under Section 122 Cr.P.C. is permissible. A bench comprising Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice J K Maheshwari observed : "Therefore, the Legislature introduced the said Chapter conferring powers on the authorities to take action for violation of peace and tranquility in public order by the citizens of the locality, otherwise, by following the procedure as prescribed, the action may be taken by the competent authority." The  Court further observed that it is a trite law that by following the procedure established by law, the personal liberty of the citizens can be dealt with. The bench was considering a Special Leave Petition assailing Madras High Court's order of upholding the order passed by the Second Class Executive Magistrate.  The Second Class Executive Magistrate had found the appellant guilty for breach of the conditions of bond which was executed for maintaining good behavior and peace for a period of 1 year and punished him by exercising powers u/s 122(1)(b) of the CrPC, 1973. While dismissing the appeal in Devadassan v. The Second Class Executive Magistrate, Ramanathapuram & Ors, the bench said,  "In the facts of the case at hand, nothing has been brought on record that how and in what manner the procedure contemplated under Chapter VIII of Cr.P.C. has not been followed. It is a trite law that by following the procedure established by law, the personal liberty of the citizens can be dealt with. Looking to the facts of this case, the bond executed by the appellant on 24.2.2021 under Section 110 read with Section 117 Cr.P.C. has been violated by him on account of his involvement in a criminal case, registered subsequently. In the present case, the bond executed by the appellant has not been questioned. In fact, the subsequent action of passing the order dated 13.5.2021 sending him to the custody due to violation of the bond as per the mandate of law has been assailed. As per the discussion made hereinabove, in our considered opinion, the order passed by respondent No. 1 is after following the procedure, so prescribed and affording due opportunity to the appellant. The High Court has rightly affirmed the said order. In the facts, the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be countenanced." Factual Background  The appellant ("Devadassan") was indulged in criminal activities but the Second Class Executive Magistrate after notice and affording opportunity passed an order u/s 117 r/w Section 110(e) CrPC, 1973. In compliance the appellant executed a bond for maintaining good behavior and peace for a period of one year and also undertook to pay Rs. 50,000/­ as penalty to the Government in case of breach or else face the proceedings under Section 122(1)(b) Cr.P.C.  On execution of bond, he was found involved in an offence of commission of murder and an crime was registered against him u/s 147/148/342/302 r/w 109/120(B) IPC. Thus the Second Class Executive Magistrate found him guilty for breach of bond, ordered his arrest and sent him to custody. Aggrieved, the appellant approached the High Court. The High Court however upheld the order passed by the Magistrate. Submission Of Counsel  Appearing for the appellant, Advocate A. Lakshminarayanan submitted that the orders were passed without following the procedure prescribed and afford reasonable opportunity. Reference was also made to the Delhi High Court judgement in Aldanish vs. State of NCT of Delhi 2018 SCC online Del 12207, Madras High Court's judgement of Devi vs. Executive Magistrate (Mad HC) 2020 SCC online Mad 2706 and Top Court's judgements in Prem Chand vs. Union of India (1981) 1 SCC 639 and Gopalanachari vs. State of Kerala 1980 (Supp) SCC 649, to highlight that Courts have expressed concerns about Executive Magistrate's exercising power in a cavalier manner. Appearing for the State, Advocate Dr. Joseph Aristotle S submitted that eight criminal cases were pending against the appellant, therefore a bond of good behaviour was taken while exercising power u/s 117 CrPC asking security. He further submitted that the impugned order was passed rightly as the order was passed rightly by exercising powers u/s 122(1)(b) on violation of the bond. It was also the counsel's contention that the Magistrate had followed the procedure contemplated.  Supreme Court's Analysis With regards to the judgements referred by the appellant's counsel such as Aldanish vs. State of NCT of Delhi 2018 SCC online Del 12207, Devi vs. Executive Magistrate (Mad HC) 2020 SCC online Mad 2706 and Gopalanachari vs. State of Kerala 1980 (Supp) SCC 649, the bench said,  "In the facts of the case at hand, nothing has been brought on record that how and in what manner the procedure contemplated under Chapter VIII of Cr.P.C. has not been followed. It is a trite law that by following the procedure established by law, the personal liberty of the citizens can be dealt with. Looking to the facts of this case, the bond executed by the appellant on 24.2.2021 under Section 110 read with Section 117 Cr.P.C. has been violated by him on account of his involvement in a criminal case, registered subsequently. In the present case, the bond executed by the appellant has not been questioned. In fact, the subsequent action of passing the order dated 13.5.2021 sending him to the custody due to violation of the bond as per the mandate of law has been assailed. As per the discussion made hereinabove, in our considered opinion, the order passed by respondent No. 1 is after following the procedure, so prescribed and affording due opportunity to the appellant. The High Court has rightly affirmed the said order. In the facts, the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be countenanced." Case Title: Devadassan v. The Second Class Executive Magistrate, Ramanathapuram & Ors.| Criminal Appeal No. 388 of 2022 Coram: Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Maheshwari     
The Madhya Pradesh High Court bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Maninder S. Bhatti has upheld the cancellation of GST registration as there was a delay of 18 months in filing the appeal without reasonable justification.  The petitioner company/assessee was registered under the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. On account of non-filing of a return, the GST number allotted to the petitioner was cancelled. Against cancellation, the petitioner preferred an appeal. The appeal was dismissed.   The assessee has challenged the order cancelling the GST registration.  The respondent/department submitted that the registration of the petitioner was cancelled on 19.06.2019, against which the petitioner herein preferred an appeal on 30.01.2021. The appeal was taken up on 16.03.2021. The Appellate Authority, taking into consideration provisions under Section 107 of the GST Act, dismissed the appeal as time barred.  Section 107(1) of the GST Act provides that an appeal can be preferred within a period of three (3) months from the date of the order. Section 107 (4) stipulates that the Appellate Authority, if satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the period of limitation of 3 months, may allow it to be presented within a further period of one month.  The court observed that the order of cancellation of registration was passed way back on 19.06.2019 and the appeal was preferred by the petitioner on 30.01.2021. Thus, the appeal was preferred almost one and a half years after the date of the order of cancellation of registration.  The court held that the total period during which the appeal ought to have been preferred was four months from the date of cancellation of registration. However, despite a lapse of four months, the appeal was not preferred by the petitioner, and even in the memo of appeal, sufficient reasons for not filing the appeal in time were disclosed. There was an unexplained delay of one and a half years in filing the appeal.  Case Title: M/s Rajdhani Security Force Pvt. Ltd Versus UOI  Dated: 25.04.2022  Counsel For Petitioner: None  Counsel For Respondent: Advocate Ankit Agarwal    
The Orissa High Court has confirmed the conviction and the ensuing life term imposed on a man for committing murder of his cousin-brother. While dismissing the appeal filed by the accused against his conviction, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice Radha Krishna Pattanaik found no reason to interfere with the reasoned order of the Trial Court. However, it was brought to the notice of the Court that during the pendency of the appeal, the Government of Odisha in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 remitted the unexpired portion of the sentence passed against the accused and ordered his premature release. Pursuant thereto, the appellant had already been set free.  Hence, the Court held that no further steps are required to be taken against the appellant and accordingly, disposed of the appeal.  On 23/24th April, 2005 around midnight, the accused is said to have assaulted the deceased, his cousin brother, with a sword, as a result of which the deceased sustained severe bleeding injuries and died on the spot.  Mr. Somanath Sahu, attached to the Karanjia Police Station (PS) (P.W.10) proceeded to the spot, took down the report of P.W. 1 (wife of the deceased), registered it as an FIR and took up the investigation. He then arrested the accused. While in custody, the accused offered to produce the sword used to murder the deceased and pursuant thereto, the sword was seized from a straw heap near the house of the deceased. A charge-sheet was filed. The accused denied the charge and claimed trial.  Ten numbers of witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution. P.W. 1 in her cross-examination stated that the accused assaulted her husband with the sword. She denied the suggestion that at the time of the incident the deceased was armed with an axe or that he tried to assault the accused with that axe or in the result of a tussle with the accused, the deceased had sustained injuries.  P.W. 2 (aunt of the accused) too stood firm in her cross-examination. While she said she was not able to see clearly in the night, she still did not deny that it was the accused who had murdered the deceased. As far as P.W. 3 was concerned, his version too could not be shaken in the cross-examination.  Accordingly, the Session Judge, Mayurbhanj convicted the accused-appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC for the murder of his cousin, Basanta Kumar Naik and sentenced him to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment (RI) for three months. Against such conviction, the accused had filed the criminal appeal in the High Court.  The counsel for the appellant sought to build the case of the offence being one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Reliance was placed on the decisions of the Supreme Court in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Wazir Chand, (1978) 1 SCC 130; Ravi Kumar v. State of Punjab, (2005) 9 SCC 315; Surinder Kumar v. Union Territory, Chandigarh, (1989) 2 SCC 217; Pardeshiram v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2021) 3 SCC 238 and Gurmukh Singh v. State of Haryana, (2009) 15 SCC 635.  However, the Court distinguished all of the above cases from the case in hand and held no comparison could be made between them. Consequently, it was not persuaded that in the present case the offence should be converted to one punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC.  The Court found no error committed by the trial Court in convicting the appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.   Case Title: Daku @ Dasarathi Dehury v.

The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) plea seeking a direction to the State Government to enhance the age of superannuation of the employees of the State of U.P. from 60 years to 62 years. Stressing that in service matters, no public interest litigation is maintainable, the Bench of Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Rajnish Kumar dsimissed the plea noting that the petitioner was a complete stranger and was seeking alteration in the conditions of service of the employees of the State Government. Essentially, one Vinod Kumar Garg had moved the instant PIL plea seeking to enhance the age of superannuation of the employees of the State of U.P. from 60 years to 62 years. At the outset, the Court noted that it was strange that such a petition had been filed purportedly in public interest. The Court also noted that the petitioner was a complete stranger so far as the conditions of service of the employees of the State Government were concerned.  "It is also noticeable that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in more than one cases has categorically held that in service matters, no public interest litigation will be maintainable," the Court remarked as it referred to Apex Court's rulings in the cases of Dr. Duryodhan Sahu and others versus Jitendra Kumar Mishra and others (1998) 7 SCC 273 and Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware vs. State of Maharashtra and others (2005) 1 SCC 590. "When we closely examine the averments made in the writ petition, what we find is that the petitioner is a complete stranger and has in fact sought alteration in the conditions of service of the employees of the State Government, hence we are not inclined to entertain the instant writ petition," the Court further added as it dismissed the plea.

Ending a major controversy over the election of Mayor of Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Supreme Court on Friday held that nominated members of the municipal corporation cannot vote in the elections for mayor. The Court also held that nominated members cannot vote either in the elections for Deputy Mayor and Standing Committees. Also, the election of the Mayor has to precede the election of Deputy Mayor. The Court held so while deciding a petition filed by AAP leader Shelly Oberoi. Although the MCD elections were held in December 2022, the mayoral elections were stalled after the dispute between the AAP and BJP over allowing nominated members to vote. A bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice PS Narasimha and Justice JB Pardiwala relied on Article 243R of the Constitution and Section 3(3) of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 to hold that persons nominated by administrator do not have the right to vote. "The prohibition on nominated members exercising the right to vote in terms of S 3(3)(b)(1) shall apply to the first meeting where the mayor and the deputy mayor are to be elected", the bench ordered. The bench rejected the arguments of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi that nominated members are entitled to vote. The bench issued the following directions : At the first meeting of the MCD, an election shall be initially held for the post of Mayor and in that election members who are nominated shall not have the right to voteUpon the election of the Mayor, the Mayor shall act as Presiding Authority for conducting the election of Deputy Mayor and members of Standing Committee, at which also the prohibition on the nominated members to vote shall continue.Notice convening the first meeting of the Municipal Corporation shall be issued within 24 hours. The notice shall indicate the first meeting of the Municipal Corporation at which the election of the Mayor should be held. "Aldermen (nominated members) cannot vote and that is the basic principle of democracy", CJI Chandrachud orally said after dictating the order.  Arguments Senior Advocate Dr AM Singhvi, assisted by Advocate Shadan Farasat, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that as per Article 243R of the Indian Constitution, as well as its mirroring provision- Section 3(3) of the DMC Act of 1957, nominated persons cannot vote. He added that as per Regulation 7 of the DMC (Procedure & Conduct of Business) Regulations, the mayor had to preside over the elections for the deputy mayor and the members of the Standing Committee. Thus, he argued that the mayor had to be elected first and then elections for deputy mayor as well as standing committee members could be held. Accordingly, the elections for these posts could not be held simultaneously. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing on behalf of the MCD, drew a distinction between meetings and the first meeting of the municipal corporation. He stated– "The first meeting is the foundational meeting which is held to bring into existence the corporation itself- the entire corporation, not just the councillors. And in the first meeting everyone can vote. Once the mayor is elected, only then corporation kicks in." This argument was also forwarded by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the LG who submitted that as per Section 33 of the DMC Act, 1957, all members could vote in the first meeting. Senior Advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the opposition Mayor candidate, also supported the arguments of LG and MCD.

Mr. Shoumendu Mukherji, AOR Summary - Supreme Court holds that nominated members cannot vote in the election of Mayor of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Constitution of India - Article 243R-The Constitution has imposed a restriction in terms of which nominated members who are brought in on account of their special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration do not have the right to vote- The same restriction finds statutory recognition in Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. The above provisions indicate that persons who are nominated under the sub-clause shall not have the right to vote in the meetings of the Corporation. The Constitution and the Act place value on their experience but the right to vote is not granted to them at meetings of the Corporation - Para 11 Delhi Municipal Corporation Act- Delhi Municipal Corporation (Procedure and Conduct of Business) Regulations- These provisions make it abundantly clear that the election of the Mayor has to be held first. The elected Mayor is then required to preside over the election of the Deputy Mayor as the presiding authority. Consequently, with this clarification, it must be noted that the election of the Mayor shall be conducted first in the first meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Once the Mayor is elected, the elected Mayor shall be the presiding authority for the purpose of the election of the Deputy Mayor - Para 12.  
The Karnataka High Court has directed the State government to ensure that if transfers are made after the period of general transfers, no request for transfers should be entertained or orders made unless there is a vacant place.

The Karnataka High Court has directed the State government to ensure that if transfers are made after the period of general transfers, no request for transfers should be entertained or orders made unless there is a vacant place.  A single judge bench of Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav allowed a petition filed by one Murthy and set aside the order of transfer dated 23.12.2021 issued to him. It placed the petitioner back in the position prior to the impugned order of transfer.  Further the bench said,  "It is only expected that the State will ensure strict compliance with its own Circular of 27.03.2017 as well as directions of the Division Bench passed in M.Arun Prasad's case (supra) and the observations in Mahiboob Sab's case (supra)."  In its order in the case of M Arun, W.P.No.58931/2016 (S-KAT) dated 02.03.2017 the bench had deprecated the practice of lifting an officer from one post but not clarifying about his next posting. "He is expected to approach before the concerned Department for appropriate posting and another Officer vice him is already posted. This practice would keep the Officer in lurch..."  The government circular dated 27.03.2017 stipulates that reasons must be recorded in writing for not showing posting to any Government Servant and such reasons should be "compelling administrative reasons like non availability of post due to abolishment/ up-gradation/ down-gradation, shifting in lieu of suspension, requirement of Government Servant to perform urgent confidential work in a post, unsuitability or inefficiency to work in the existing vacancy or for being utilised against temporary and leave vacancy etc., which are only illustrative but not exhaustive". Procedure is also shown to review orders of transfer by the Head of the Department where a person displaced is not shown posting recording reasons in writing.  The petitioner by the impugned order was asked to report to the competent authority for obtaining an order for posting. Only after six months, that is only on 20.07.2022, after the order during the pendency of the present proceedings, the petitioner was given an order of posting at the Town Municipal Council, Ullal (for vacant post).  To which the bench said,  "In the present case, none of the procedures are followed. Despite the observations by the Division Bench of this Court in M.Arun Prasad's case (supra) and also the Government Circulars referred to above, time and again orders of transfer are being passed without showing places for posting."  Further it observed,  "In the present case, as stated earlier, there was no vacant place while considering the representation of the respondent No.6 to be transferred and posted in the place of the petitioner. It is also noticed that the case of respondent No.6 is on the basis of the letter of the Member of the Legislative Assembly. Nevertheless, procedure requires to be followed."  Finally it held,  "Accordingly, on two grounds i.e., not showing an order of posting for a period of more than six [6] months and on the ground that no transfer must be made except to a vacant post after the period of general transfers, while noticing that the transfer is made in December 2021 as noticed in the proceedings of transfer, the petition is allowed. The impugned order dated 23.12.2021 at Annexure - A is set aside. The parties are directed to be placed in the position prior to the impugned order."  Case Title: MURTHY v.

The Orissa High Court has upheld the conviction of a person, who was sentenced to life for committing murder of his cousin-brother. While dismissing the appeal, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dr. S. Muralidhar and Justice Radha Krishna Pattanaik observed,  "This is not a case of mistaken identity since all the witnesses are close relations of both the accused and the deceased. The fact that the accused hits the deceased with Bala on the head clearly reveals his intention to cause the death of the deceased. This was not on the spur of the moment. The quarrel happened in the evening whereas the incident happened in the night when the deceased was sleeping and wholly unarmed. There was no need for the close relations of the accused to falsely implicate him in the homicidal death of the deceased." Factual Background:  As per the prosecution, the mother of the accused had left the house after quarrelling with his father. The accused was said to have been upset with this and threatened his father. The deceased, who happened to be the elder cousin brother of the accused, protested this act of the accused. A quarrel ensued between them. However, at that point in time, the dispute subsided and, in the evening, both the accused and the deceased took their meals in the house of the accused. The deceased slept in the verandah. At around 11.30 PM, on hearing the shout of the deceased, the Informant (P.W. 1), the father of the deceased and the uncle of the accused woke up and saw the accused standing with a Bala and his son, the deceased, lying with head injuries. P.W.1 chased the accused, who ran away throwing the Bala at the spot. The P.W. 1 lodged the report at the Bamebari Outpost. Mr. Pradeep Kumar Baral (P.W.8) was the Investigating Officer (IO), who on 14th June, 2003 at around 7 AM took down the complaint in writing, registered the case and took up investigation. On 15th June 2003, he seized the wearing apparels of the deceased and on the same day at 10.30 AM arrested the accused and seized the wearing apparels of the accused. The charge was laid against the accused for the offence under Section 302 IPC. He pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. P.W.1, spoke clearly about he having witnessed the incident. In his cross-examination, he made clear that a 'Dibiri' (a small kerosene lamp) was burning in the room and he was clearly able to recognize the accused. He also mentioned how his wife and his daughter (P.W.3) also woke up and saw the accused run away. He said "to my knowledge, there was no enmity between the accused and the deceased." Except the above sentence, nothing else emerged in the cross-examination of the informant to doubt the veracity of his testimony. It was argued that the above sentence in the cross-examination shows there was no motive for the crime. However, P.W. 3 said that "at evening, the accused being drunk came to our house and there was exchange of words between my brother and accused. Being asked by us, the accused went away to his house." Blood stains were detected on the Bala but the blood grouping and the origine could not be detected. On the basis of these evidence, the Sessions Judge, Keonjhar convicted the accused (appellant herein) for the offence punishable under Section 302, IPC and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for lie. This appeal was filed against the said judgment dated 13th July, 2006. Court's Observations:  The Court observed that clearly there was a quarrel between the deceased and the accused in the evening whereas the murder took place in the night while the deceased was sleeping. Although P.W. 3 said in the cross-examination "there was no quarrel between the accused and deceased prior to this incident", what she was referring to, it held, were incidents prior to the quarrel that took place between the accused and the deceased. The Court further held that the instant case is not a matter of mistaken identity since all the witnesses are close relations of both the accused and the deceased. Again, the fact that the accused hits the deceased with Bala on the head clearly reveals his intention to cause the death of the deceased. Therefore, this was clearly not on the spur of the moment. The quarrel happened in the evening whereas the unfortunate incident happened in the night when the deceased was sleeping and wholly unarmed. Accordingly, the Court held that there was no need for the close relations of the accused to falsely implicate him in the murder of the deceased.

Coming down heavily on a litigant for approaching the court on his whims and fancies depending upon the change in the political climate of the State, the Madras High Court recently dismissed a plea and imposed heavy costs.  Justice Anand Venkatesh noted that from the conduct of the Petitioner, it was clear that he would use this Court by filing Writ Petitions whenever the political climate was not in his favour and withdraw the same once it turns in his favour. It remarked as under: A litigant must understand that Court proceedings are to be taken seriously and the rights have to be agitated sincerely before a Court. The Court will come to the aid of only such litigants. Insofar as the petitioner is concerned, he was coming to this Court as if it was an amusement park and he got in and got out as per his own whims and fancies. The petitioner has to necessarily face the consequences for such a conduct.  Background When the South Asian Federation (SAF) games were conducted in Chennai in 1995, the government decided to use it as a visible economic proposition by commercialisation of the events involving private sector. A tender was floated and M/s. Times TV, was declared as the highest bidder and they started spending money on the advertisements. The petitioner entered the scene and quoted an amount of Rs.2 Crores which he later increased to Rs.3 Crores. G.O. was passed on 9.12.1995 in favour of the petitioner and a Memorandum of Understanding was also entered into with the petitioner.  After the SAF games ended, the petitioner made a request on 3.2.1996 seeking for the waiver of a sum of Rs.2 Crores and the petitioner came forward to remit only a sum of Rs.1 Crore. On 15.4.1996, the petitioner submitted a breakup of the expenditure and receipts. In this letter, there were absolutely no details or bills attached to substantiate the claim made for the expenditure incurred by the petitioner. Subsequently a G.O.Ms.No.324, dated 6.5.1996 was issued by granting waiver to the petitioner to the tune of Rs.2 Crores. This was in light of his proximity with the Government which was in the helm of affairs.  Interestingly, when the subsequent government came into power, it observed that the above GO was issued in spite of objections from the finance department and in a hurried manner. The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Wing registered an FIR against all involved and started a criminal case.  Meanwhile, the Government, while reconsidering the GO, issued a show cause notice to the Petitioner. Though he challenged the same he was directed by the court to give a reply to the show cause. After considering the reply of the petitioner, the issued G.O.Ms.No.45, dated 12.10.2000 cancelling G.O.Ms No.324, dated 6.5.1996.   The court opined that the petitioner challenged this impugned GO on multiples occasions and withdrew them whenever the political situation in the country was in his favour. While withdrawing these petitions challenging the impugned GO, the reason given by the petitioner was that he intended to make representations before the government. The government considered the representation of the petitioner, rejected it, and initiated revenue recovery proceedings for recovery of Rs. 2 crore. Hence, the present petition was filed by the petitioner challenging both the impugned GO and initiation of revenue recovery proceedings.   The petitioner submitted that the G.O was passed in violation of principles of natural justice. He contended that there was no ground to sustain the impugned G.O after filing of the "Further Action Dropped" Report in the criminal case. He submitted that impugned G.O. suffers from lack of jurisdiction since the dispute between the petitioner and the Government should have been decided by a different body and the Government should not have decided its own case. He also submitted that since he was made to act on the earlier GO, the impugned GO was vitiated by principles of estoppel. He contended that the GO was vitiated by malafides and the materials relied upon by the State were also not disclosed to the petitioner.   The respondents submitted that the petition was not maintainable on the ground that the petitioner had withdrawn the earlier Writ Petitions and hence, the present Writ Petitions are hit by the principles of res judicata.   The court considered the submissions of the petitioner. With respect to the plea that the GO was passed in violation to the principles of natural justice, the court opined that the same was unsustainable. The petitioner was given due notice, to which he replied. Every ground was considered in detail and only thereafter the GO was passed.   With respect to the plea of lack of jurisdiction, the court observed that it was always left open to a Government to correct its mistakes when a palpable illegality is brought to its notice. Since there was apparent favouritism existed from the beginning which also caused a loss of Rs.2 Crores to the State exchequer, the Government was within it's power and jurisdiction to issue GO. Since the earlier GO was a favour done for the petitioners, the principle of estoppel would not apply to the present case.   The court was not satisfied with the contention of malafide raised by the Petitioner. The court remarked that sufficient grounds existed for cancellation of the GO. The court observed that it was a trend to raise the plea of malafide whenever a subsequent government initiated actions.  "If any person chooses to conduct his business with an apparent political identity, it has its own consequences. With such a political identity, a routine ground that is always raised is mala fides when action is initiated by the subsequent Government. Mala fides is a ground which has to be pleaded and proved and it is not a matter of assumption. The petitioner has not made out a case for mala fides and G.O.Ms.No.45 gives solid reasons as to why the earlier G.O. was cancelled and it has to be sustained on its own merits."  The court further observed that the plea of non payment of advertisement charges should have been prosecuted by the Petitioner through a Civil Suit. "The petitioner took a calculated risk and withdrew the Civil Suit and hence he has to blame only himself for the situation in which he is placed." the court recorded. It imposed a cost of Rs.1 Lakh to be deposited to the Chief Justice Relief Fund within a period of four weeks.  Case Title: V.Krishnamurthy v.

The Bombay High Court recently dealt with a case wherein a truck driver, who was the employee of the owner of the truck met with a vehicular accident. As he had initiated compensation proceedings under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 ("M.V. Act"), his claim for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act 1923 (now Employees Compensation Act 1923) ("W.C. Act") was not entertained by the commissioner.  Single Judge S. G. MEHARE noted that the question before the court was, "Whether the compensation granted under chapter X of the M.V. act forfeits the right of the employee to claim the compensation under section 3 of the 1923 Act as provided under Section 167 of the M.V. Act?" This was answered in the negative by the court.  The appellant was a driver of the truck of respondent no. 1 which was insured by respondent no. 2. He met with a vehicular accident in which his left leg was injured, and he suffered 35% physical disability. He could not work as before the accident. He served the notices to both respondents. However, none of the respondents has paid him the compensation. Hence, he filed an application under Section 3 and 22 of W.C. Act.  The Commissioner rejected his claim as he had already approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. He had received compensation under section 140 of the M.V. Act therefore, the Commissioner held that the claim is barred under section 167 of the M.V. Act.  Aggrieved, the appellant filed this appeal. Relying upon the case of Maroti Shrawan Manghate vs Smt. Rita Y. Sapra and Anr. [2018 (1) All MR. 700], he stated that the Commissioner has misread and misinterpreted section 167 of the M.V. Act. An application under Section 140 of M.V. Act does not fall under the bar of Section 169 of M.V. Act. An application for compensation either under the W.C. Act or M.V. Act is maintainable pursuant to a Section 140 application.   The court noted that section 140 is part of Chapter X of the M.V. Act which deals with liability without fault in certain cases. Section 140 speaks of the liability to pay compensation in certain cases i.e death and permanent disablement, on the principle of no fault. Compensation under this chapter is in addition to the right to claim compensation under the principle of fault except the right to claim under section 163-A of the M.V. Act. Section 144 provides for the overriding effect of the provisions of this chapter.  The court observed that, "The provisions of the Sections are unambiguous, that where the death or permanent disablement is caused to an employee in a vehicular motor accident, he is entitled to the compensation under the principle of no fault liability in addition to the compensation under the principle of fault liability."  Section 167 of the M.V. Act enables a driver who is also an employee to select which forum he wants to approach for compensation, reliefs granted under chapter X of the M.V. Act would not come in the way of claiming compensation before the Commissioner of Employee's Compensation or the Claims Tribunal, the court observed.  The court concluded that if the employee receives compensation under Chapter X of the M.V. Act, his remedy to seek compensation either under the W.C. Act or the M.V. Act cannot be forfeited under section 167. Such an employee has an option to move an application for compensation either under the W.C. Act or M.V. Act.  The court noted that Commissioner has misread and misinterpreted Section 167 of the M.V. Act and erroneously dismissed the application of the appellant. Therefore, the appeal is allowed, and the impugned order is quashed and set aside. Since all the issues have not been answered on merit, the matter is sent back to the Commissioner of Employee's Compensation for determination of the compensation afresh within six months from the receipt of this order.

Relying on the Apex Court decision in National Insurance Company Limited v.

Pranay Sethi & Ors., the Telangana High Court recently ruled that the compensation in motor vehicle accident death claims should include amount under conventional heads viz. loss of estate, loss of consortium, and funeral expenses.  Brief facts of the case  The claimants who are the husband and children of the deceased filed a petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act claiming compensation of Rs. 4,50,000/- for the death of the deceased who died in a motor accident. It was stated that due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle driver, the inmates of the vehicle including the deceased sustained grievous injuries. The deceased was aged about 41 years and was earning Rs. 4,500/- per month as maid servant. Hence, the claimants filed claim petition against the owner and insurer of the car.  The Tribunal awarded compensation of Rs. 2,80,000/- with proportionate costs and interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of petition till realisation, payable by the owner of the vehicle (as the terms of insurance policy were violated).  The claimants filed the appeal challenging the quantum of compensation awarded by the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal. It was also stated that even though the deceased was a 'gratuitous passenger', the Insurance Company is liable to pay the awarded sum to the claimants and then to recover the said sum from the insured.   Issue  Whether the claimants are entitled for enhancement of compensation? Whether pay and recovery can be ordered against the insurer?   Court's ruling  The court observed that the Tribunal had after considering the age, avocation of the deceased rightly awarded an amount of Rs. 2,80,000/- under the head loss of income, which needs no interference.   However, the court noted that in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and Ors., 2017, the Supreme court had held that "the reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium, and funeral expenses should be Rs. 15,000/- , Rs. 40,000/- and Rs. 15,000/- respectively."  The court noted that the Tribunal has not awarded any amount under conventional heads and therefore, an amount of total Rs. 70,000/- under conventional heads needs to be paid to claimants. Thus, in all claimants are entitled to Rs. 3,50,000/-. So far as the second issue is concerned, the Court noted in Manuara Khatun v. Rajesh Kr. Sing it was held that the direction to the Insurance Company, being the insurer of the offending vehicle which was found involved in causing accident due to negligence of its driver needs to be issued directing them to first pay the awarded sum to the claimants and then recover the paid awarded sum from the owner of the offending vehicle in execution proceedings. Accordingly, the compensation amount awarded by tribunal was enhanced and Insurance Company was directed to deposit the said amount to the credit of the claimant along with accrued interest within two months, and then recover the said amount from the vehicle owner.

The Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Bela M. Trivedi held that while giving opinion regarding grant of remission under Section 432(2) Cr.P.C. the Presiding Judge needs to give reasons with regard to the factors to be taken into consideration as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India. Facts of the Criminal Writ Petition in Brief  The petitioners are convicts and undergoing sentence of life imprisonment in view of the order passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh. They, along with other co-accused, were charged for the offences under Section 147, 148, 302/149, 307/149 of IPC and Section 3(2)(5) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Corruption Act). They were all tried and found guilty for the said offences by the Special Judge (SC, ST), Durg, in Special Case No. 16/2006, were sentenced to life imprisonment. It was alleged against them that all the accused, 8 in number, had constituted an unlawful assembly and had killed 2 people using deadly weapons like sword, axe, wooden stick etc.  The petitioners have invoked Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking issuance of appropriate writ, order or direction commanding the respondents for presenting the case of the petitioners to the sentencing Court for fresh consideration.  String of Rejections without reasoned orders  In the present case, the petitioners subsequent applications for remission were rejected by the concerned authorities time and again without any reasoned orders. They had undergone imprisonment for 16 years (21 years without remission) and had submitted their respective applications under Section 432(2) of Cr.PC to the Jail Superintendent seeking their premature release. The Jail Superintendent had sought an opinion of the concerned Sessions Court which had convicted the petitioners. The concerned Sessions Court had denied their request in view of the facts and circumstances of the case. The Law Department, too, agreed with the Presiding Judge. The Director General, Jail and Correctional Services, also, rejected the applications of the petitioner.  Meanwhile, one of the co-accused Ram Chander, had filed a writ petition earlier before the Supreme Court. That petition was disposed of by the Supreme Court which directing the Special Judge to provide an opinion afresh accompanied by adequate reasoning after taking into consideration the relevant factors laid down in the case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India. The Special Judge, therefore, considering the guidelines given by the top court in the said case recommended to remit his sentence.  Judgment  In the present case as well, the bench decided to pass the same order as passed in Ram Chander's petition. "Since the case of the present petitioners is also similar to the case of the co-accused Ram Chander, in as much as the Presiding Officer’s opinions contained in the letters dated 02.07.2021, 10.08.2021 and 01.10.2021 do not contain reasons with regard to the factors to be taken into consideration as laid down in case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India (supra), we propose to pass similar order as passed in the case of co-accused Ram Chander.” After a discussion on the factors laid down in case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India, to be considered by the Presiding Judge while giving opinion under Section 432(2) Cr.P.C., and the powers of the appropriate Government to suspend or remit sentences under Sections 432 and 433-A of Cr.PC., the Court held, "Presiding Officer’s opinions contained in the letters dated 02.07.2021, 10.08.2021 and 01.10.2021 do not contain reasons with regard to the factors to be taken into consideration as laid down in case of Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India...Accordingly, we direct the Special Judge, Durg to provide an opinion on the applications of the petitioners afresh accompanied by adequate reasoning after taking into consideration the relevant factors that govern the grant of remission as laid down in Laxman Naskar vs. Union of India."  Importantly, in the case of Laxman Naskar, the Supreme Court had held that the following factors were be considered by the presiding officer while exercising powers under 432(2): (i) whether the offence affects the society at large; (ii) the probability of the crime being repeated; (iii) the potential of the convict to commit crimes in future; (iv) if any fruitful purpose is being served by keeping the convict in prison; and (v) the socio-economic condition of the convict’s family.

The Rajasthan High Court on Thursday observed that merely the fact that the wife is earning would not dis-entitle her from claiming maintenance from her husband. The Court opined that the charge of desertion cannot become a ground so as to enable the husband to disqualify the wife from claiming the amount of monthly maintenance, in any manner whatsoever. Essentially, the marriage of the parties was solemnized on 27.05.2010 at Bikaner; thereafter, the couple went to reside in the USA. Out of the said wedlock, Master Anay (son) was born on 21.05.2011. On account of the alleged disharmony in their matrimonial relationship, the wife left her matrimonial home at USA on 13.11.2013 and came back to India alongwith the son. Later, the wife filed an application against the husband under Section 125 Cr.P.C. which was allowed by the trial court on 30.08.2018, while awarding a monthly maintenance to the wife and son, to the tune of Rs.50,000/- and Rs.20,000/- (totalling Rs.70,000/-). The petitioner-wife has preferred the present criminal revision petition challenging the said order while making prayer only to the extent that the amount of monthly maintenance be enhanced to Rs.2,50,000/- (for wife) and Rs.1,30,000/- (for son). In contrast, the husband sought quashing and setting aside the said order. Dr. Justice Pushpendra Singh Bhati, while disposing of the petition, observed, "After hearing learned counsel for the parties as well as perusing the record of the case along with the precedent laws cited at the Bar, this Court holds that merely the fact that the wife is earning would not dis-entitle her from the maintenance. The husband himself has taken the divorce on 29.04.2015, fact not in dispute, and therefore, the charge of desertion cannot become a ground so as to enable the husband to disqualify the wife from claiming the amount of monthly maintenance, in any manner whatsoever." The court noted that the trial court had rightly arrived at a considered decision. The court deemed it appropriate to enhance the monthly maintenance payable by husband to the wife and son, considering the cost of living at Hyderabad and the fact that both the husband and wife were maintaining a very good lifestyle in the USA. Moreover, it was opined by the court that the husband is earning about Rs.12,00,000/- per month and the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- per month, and therefore, a very reasonable capacity of the husband to pay the maintenance should be 1/12th of his income, which shall take care of the husband's claim for high cost of living in USA. In this regard, the court, while modifying the trial court's order, enhanced the amount of monthly maintenance to the wife and the son i.e. Rs.75000/- and Rs. 25000/- respectively. The counsel for the husband submitted that the wife is earning Rs.85,000/- per month and staying at Hyderabad, and thus, competent to earn her own livelihood, while the husband does not oppose the maintenance granted to the son vide the impugned order. He also submitted that the wife deserted the husband of her own sweet and free will, and thus, she is not entitled for any kind of maintenance. The counsel for the wife submitted that the husband is taking the plea of desertion by the wife, merely to deny maintenance to her, as awarded by the learned court below, whereas, he himself had sought divorce in the Court at USA and the same was ex parte done in favour of the husband on 29.04.2015, while passing the necessary decree. He placed reliance on Rajnesh v. Neha & Anr [2021], whereby the Supreme Court observed that even if the wife is earning, then also she is entitled for the determination of maintenance, in accordance with the lifestyle of her husband in the matrimonial home. Moreover, the wife's counsel submitted that the sustenance does not mean and cannot be allowed to mean a mere survival, and the lifestyle at Hyderabad, where the wife alongwith her son is presently residing, is very costly, and the son is also going in a good and reputed school at Hyderabad, the expenditure whereof is also too high. He also submitted that even if the wife is earning something, then also she is entitled to claim the necessary and adequate maintenance from her husband. Adv. Parvej Moyal appeared for the wife while Adv. Shadan Farasat a/w Adv. Harshit Bhurani appeared for the husband. Case Title: Neha Mathur & Anr. v. Dr. Arvind Kishore with connected matter      
The Bombay High Court on Monday allowed a death row convict, who murdered his mother and cut her body parts to eat them, to attend his daughter’s marriage. An Escort Party in civil dress will remain present at the venues. A division bench of Justice A. S. Gadkari and Justice P. D. Naik observed that his presence is necessary for performing religious ceremonies. “It is not in dispute that, presence of Applicant on the date of marriage of his daughter for performing religious ceremonies is necessary. After taking into consideration over all view of the matter, we are inclined to release the Applicant on 23rd, 24th and 25th February 2023 between 9.00 am to 6.00 p.m from jail to attend the marriage and related religious ceremonies.” In 2021, Additional Sessions Judge Mahesh Jadhav of Kolhapur District had convicted the man under section 302 (punishment for murder) if IPC for murdering his mother, cutting her body parts and preparing to cook them. The trial court awarded him capital punishment observing that his acts were heinous and shameless and fell in the category of “rarest or rare” cases. The case for confirmation of his death sentence is pending before the High Court. The convict applied for temporary bail for a week from February 22, 2023 to February 28, 2023 for the marriage of his daughter on February 24, 2023 in Kolhapur. He submitted that he has been in custody since August 28, 2017 and hasn't been released on bail, parole or furlough on a single occasion. Further, he belongs to a lower economic strata and will not be able to pay escort charges. The court considered that the applicant is from lower economic strata and directed the authorities to waive escort charges for the escort party that would accompany him at the marriage venue. Advocate Madhvi Gonathieswaran with Advocate Dr. Yug Mohit Chaudhry represented the Applicant while APP Ajay Patil represented the state.

Justice GR Swaminathan, therefore, directed the Director of Legal Studies, Chennai to issue a circular mandating the installation of portraits of Dr. Ambedkar in all Government Law Colleges.  Dr.Ambedkar is the architect of the Indian Constitution. He is the very symbol of social liberation. His scholarship is unparalleled. He can be the greatest inspiration for every law student. The Director of Legal Studies, Chennai is requested to issue circular mandating the installation of the portrait of Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar in all the Government Law Colleges in Tamil Nadu.  The judge said he would ensure that even his chambers had photographs of Dr. Ambedkar.  Charity should begin at home. As I was finalizing the draft order dictated in the open court, I looked around. I confess that the photograph of Dr.Babasaheb is not on the walls of my chambers. I resolved to make good the omission at the earliest.  The court was dealing with a plea filed by a law student who was challenging his suspension and the disciplinary action taken against him. The petitioner had sought for installation of the portrait of Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar in the office room of the Principal and for the course to be taught in Tamil Language. However, he had uttered rude and defiant words at the Principal and had conducted himself in an undisciplined manner.  Though the petitioner had impleaded his professors, the court suggested that they be given up as the case would not be taken up in the foreseeable future if it was dealt with in a routine manner. The court suggested that the petitioner could give a handwritten apology to the Principal pursuant to which the college management could give a quietus to the issue. The court also directed the government counsel to ensure that portrait of Dr.Ambedkar had been put up in the office room of the Principal.  When compliance of the above direction was reported by the Government Advocate, the petitioner was also encouraged to accept the court's suggestion. He wrote out a handwritten letter expressing his unconditional apology to the Principal and this was handed over to the teaching staff of the college.   The court also noted that the Petitioner, who belonged to a Scheduled Caste community had not indulged in any acts of violence and had merely undertaken a legitimate public cause. He had also sought sincere apology for his actions. Therefore, the principle of proportionality demands that the matter is given a quietus, the Court said and directed the Principal to treat the matter as closed.  The court also called upon the High Court Advocates Welfare Board Trust to pay a sum of Rs. 10,000 to the petitioner which would help him to buy standard law texts. The court advised the petitioner to focus on his studies for the remaining academic years.  Dr.Ambedkar said "Be Educated, Be Organised and Be Agitated". The petitioner must focus on the first advice for the next two years.   Case Title: S Sasikumar v.

The Karnataka High Court has said initiation of proceedings by a complainant, post acquittal of the accused before the Karnataka State Human Right Commission, against a police officer who investigated the complaint and filed a chargesheet in the case is unsustainable in law. A single judge bench of Justice Jyoti Mulimani made the observation while allowing a petition filed by police inspector Siddalingappa S T and quashed the order passed by the Commission dated 20.06.2015, imposing a penalty of Rs.10,000 on the charges of dereliction of duty.  The complainant K.A. Appanna had telephoned the petitioner on 26.09.2010 and informed him that on 19.09.2010 that while having food at the LVT Daba, he had a scuffle with a person named Mr.Lakshmikanth and 15 others concerning the payment of commission for purchasing land. He requested the petitioner to register a complaint.  The petitioner telephoned PSI Rajendra Kumar, and instructed him to take necessary action. Pursuant to which an FIR was filed for the alleged offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 342, 323, 324, 506(b), 327 read with Section 149 of IPC against Lakshmikanth and fifteen others. Thereafter, the PSI being the Investigating Officer, conducted the investigation and filed a charge sheet. Based on the charge sheet, the Court conducted proceedings and passed the Judgment acquitting the accused on 15.07.2013. Following which the complainant approached the Commission, which forwarded the complaint to the Inspector General of Police for conducting an inquiry and to submit a report. Based on the report submitted by IGP, KHRC proved the charges only against Mr.Rajendra Kumar, PSI Doddaballapur. The Commission issued notice to him on 30.04.2012 to give a written reason for the report submitted by the Inspector General of Police.  He then submitted a written statement of reason justifying his actions. Subsequently, the Commission based on the complaint, report of IGP, KHRC, and a written statement of reason by Rajendra Kumar, vide order dated 20.06.2015 imposed a fine of Rs.10,000 not only on Rajendra Kumar’s PSI but also on the petitioner.  The petitioner contended that petitioner being the Circle Inspector has discharged his duties honestly and obediently. The moment the petitioner received a telephone call from the complainant – the second respondent, he properly instructed the PSI Mr.Rajendra Kumar to act in accordance with the law.  The bench on going through the records said “Proceedings before the appropriate forum have been concluded. It is pivotal to note that the order of acquittal was passed by the court. If the second respondent had any grievance or was not satisfied with the order of acquittal of Lakshmikanth, the proper course would have been in a different Forum altogether.”  It added “Even the finding of the commission that the petitioner has not instructed the PSI in writing is wholly incorrect and untenable.”  Following which it held “Legal action was set in motion and the court has passed the judgment as per the law. Therefore, in my opinion, there is no dereliction of duty as alleged by the complainant. The commission has failed to have regard to relevant considerations and disregarded relevant matters. In my considered opinion, the imposition of penalty so far as the petitioner is concerned is unsustainable in law. Hence, the same is liable to be set aside.”  Accordingly it allowed the petition.

Setting aside a bail granted to a rape accused, the Supreme Court observed that the 'need of custodial trial' is not a relevant aspect while considering a bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. The relevant aspects which are required to be kept in mind while considering the bail application are seriousness of the offence alleged; material collected during the investigation; statement of the prosecutrix etc., the bench of Justices MR Shah and Hima Kohli observed. In this case, the allegations against the accused was that he had mixed some substance in the drinks that made the prosecuterix lose consciousness and thereafter, he committed the offence on intoxicating her and subjected her to the sexual act. Allowing his bail application under Section 439 CrPC, the High Court observed that this allegation is a matter of trial and that the accused is in custody from 11.02.2022 and there is no need of further custodial trial.  In appeal, the Apex Court bench noted that the High Court has not at all considered the seriousness of the allegations and the gravity of the offences alleged against the accused.  "the High Court has failed to appreciate the allegations in the FIR that immediately on the occurrence, when the prosecutrix/victim regained consciousness, she first went to the hospital and thereafter, tried to lodge the FIR but no complaint was taken. In a case like this, the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that there could have been some delay (though in the present case, it may not be said that there was any inordinate delay in lodging the FIR) as sometime could have been consumed for the victim/prosecutrix to get out of the shock. Even the said aspect is required to be considered at the time of the trial.", the court said. The bench set aside the bail order and directed the High Court to reconsider the application afresh. It observed: "Even the observation that there is no need of further custodial trial is also not relevant aspect while considering the bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. The same may have some relevance while considering the application for anticipatory bail."

The Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench has refused to interfere in the disciplinary authority's decision, which dismissed CRPF Constable-petitioner from service as he did not report for duty on completion of leave period.

The Rajasthan High Court, Jaipur Bench has refused to interfere in the disciplinary authority's decision, which dismissed CRPF Constable-petitioner from service as he did not report for duty on completion of leave period.  A division bench of Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice Sudesh Bansal, observed,  "In our view the petitioner has not made out any case for interference. We may recall, the petitioner was engaged as constable of CRPF which is a disciplined force. He remained unauthorisedly absent without sanctioned leave or communication to the department for about one year. This was a clear case of misconduct."  Essentially, the appellant-original petitioner was engaged as a constable-driver in CRPF. He was granted leave from 21.08.2013 to 19.09.2013. He, however. did not report for duty on completion of leave period. He remained unauthorisedly absent without sanction of leave from 20.09.2013 onwards, without any intimation to the department. The departmental enquiry was therefore initiated against him. He did not participate in the enquiry. Final order was passed by the disciplinary authority on 10.09.2014 imposing punishment of dismissal.  Later, the appellate authority converted the order of dismissal to removal from service. A writ petition challenging the said orders was dismissed by a Single Bench, following which the present appeal was filed.  The counsel for the appellant-original petitioner submitted that looking at the long clean service of the petitioner, extreme punishment of removal from service should not have been imposed. He submitted that the petitioner was suffering from illness on account of which he could not resume his duties. He lastly contended that none of the communications of the department reached to him because the petitioner was not living at his residence. He also placed reliance on multiple Supreme Court judgments.  Placing reliance on B.C.Chaturvedi v. Union of India [AIR 1996 SC 484], the court observed that the case of punishment essentially rests with the disciplinary authority. The Court would not interfere unless the punishment shocks the conscience of the Court.  After perusal of Section 10 and 11 of the Act, the court opined that the competent authority could impose a punishment of imprisonment for the act of remaining absent without leave, under Section 10 and the punishment of dismissal or removal from service can also be considered under section 11. The court observed that these punishments are thus within the competence of the said authority.  The court noted that the misconduct of not reporting for duty for over one year without sanctioned leave was established during the course of enquiry against the petitioner. The court added that the petitioner has not produced any evidence of his suffering from such illness which prevented him from resuming his duty and which prevented him from appearing in the departmental enquiry and any rate from communicating to the department his inability to appear.  The court also observed that all communications were made by the department at his residential address, despite which the petitioner did not appear before the disciplinary authority. The petitioner cannot complain that the enquiry was conducted ex-parte, added the court.  Adv. M.S. Raghav appeared for the appellant-original petitioner.

The Gauhati High Court has held that there is no claim on property of a deceased person by his children if the said property was not inherited by the deceased person during his lifetime. Mere living in the property does not imply that the property stood transferred to those who were the occupant of the said property.Justice Nelson Sailo observed,"Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma during his lifetime... The Gauhati High Court has held that there is no claim on property of a deceased person by his children if the said property was not inherited by the deceased person during his lifetime. Mere living in the property does not imply that the property stood transferred to those who were the occupant of the said property. Justice Nelson Sailo  observed, "Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma during his lifetime did not inherit the land and property...If such is the case, there cannot be any basis for the petitioners to make a claim for the said property on the strength of being the daughters of late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma." Brief Factual Background :  The petitioners are the granddaughters of one Shri K. Rochhinga (L) who was the original owner of the property in hand. The father of petitioners, i.e., Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma (L) was allowed to live in the property until he expired on 06.05.2014. The property continued to remain in the name of the petitioners' grandfather. Therefore, respondent no. 1 & 2 (brothers of petitioners' father) approached the Civil Judge with a Title Suit, claiming declaration to the said property and other properties left behind by late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma. During the pendency of this Title Suit, the matter was referred to the Lok Adalat and consequently, a settlement order was arrived at on 26.09.2015 by the parties concerned. The petitioners of the instant writ petition were aggrieved by this settlement order of the Lok Adalat as it did not leave any share for the petitioners on the property left behind by their late father.The respondents argued that a writ petition is not maintainable against a private person. Further, they argued that writ against the settlement order of a Lok Adalat is permissible only on limited grounds as decided by the Apex Court in State of Punjab & Anr. V. Jalour Singh & Ors. The High Court found that the grounds mentioned in Jalour Singh (supra) are not attracted in this case since the order of the Lok Adalat was passed after a mutual settlement between the parties, and was signed by the parties concerned. Thereby, the Lok Adalat neither exceed its jurisdiction nor did it exercised the powers not vested in it. "In the present case, it cannot be said that the Lok Adalat had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised the powers not vested in it, since an agreement/settlement was mutually arrived at and signed by the parties concerned. Therefore, I do not find this decision to be applicable to the case of the petitioners. " The High Court found no dispute to the fact that the petitioners were residing in the said property since the time their father was alive. Therefore, "they should be allowed to reside peacefully in the main house as long as they want to ", the Court noted. It further noted that even though the petitioners have tried to project that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 have committed fraud or mis-represented them in respect of the properties left behind by their late father, however, the fact remains that the petitioners were also given their share of the money left behind by the late father.  "The respondent Nos. 1 & 2 in their Title Suit also sought for a declaration of the properties left behind by late Shri. K. Vanlalmalsawma in their names. Therefore, it is not a case of fraud or misrepresentation as sought to be projected by the petitioners," it added. Case Name : Ms Olivia Laldinmawii Khiangte & 2 Ors. v. K. Vanlaltluanga & 3 Ors.

The Supreme Court has held that when payment of money and repayment of a portion of it is admitted by a party, then the onus to establish that there was full and final settlement of the dues is also on that party."A party who admits receipt of certain amount of money on a particular date and pleads discharge by way of a full and final settlement at a latter date, is the one on whom the... The Supreme Court has held that when payment of money and repayment of a portion of it is admitted by a party, then the onus to establish that there was full and final settlement of the dues is also on that party. "A party who admits receipt of certain amount of money on a particular date and pleads discharge by way of a full and final settlement at a latter date, is the one on whom the onus lies", the Court observed.   A Bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian allowed an appeal challenging the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had set aside the order and decree of the first appellate court in two money suits, initially dismissed by the trial court. It further imposed a cost of Rs. 50,000 on the respondents.   Factual Background  The Appellant filed two money suits against the respondents for recovery of Rs. 10,48,000 and Rs. 67,31,000 respectively. In the first instance, the appellant alleged that the respondents borrowed a sum of Rs. 10,50,000 and repaid only Rs. 5,00,000. The principal amount along with interest stood at Rs. 10,48,000. In the second suit, the appellant alleged that the respondent lured the appellant and her husband into his real estate business and got the signature of the appellant in some blank papers for ease in business transactions. Later, the appellant found out that an amount of Rs. 54,50,000 had been withdrawn from her account without her knowledge. In this regard, an FIR was lodged against the respondents under Section 420, 467, 468 and 471 read with Section 120-B of the IPC. However, the respondents were granted anticipatory bail upon furnishing a bank guarantee of Rs. 50,00,000. So, the principal amount along with 12 % interest stood at a sum of Rs. 67,31,000.  In the first suit, the respondents admitted the receipt of the money and took the plea that they had paid Rs. 5,00,000 on 07.08.2006 as full and final settlement. For the second suit, the defence taken by the respondents was that the money was received for business transactions, out of which Rs 30,00,000 was given to the respondents by the appellant and his son out of love and affection.  The trial court had dismissed both the suits. On appeal, the first appellate court reversed the order of the trial court which was eventually set aside by the High Court in the second appeal. The High Court had also directed the appellant to refund the money that the respondents had paid in the proceedings for grant of anticipatory bail.  Contentions raised by the parties  Advocate, Mr. Rajiv Bhalla, appearing on behalf of the appellant argued that the trial court and the High Court had erred to accept the respondents' plea of full and final settlement. Senior Advocate, Mr. Nidhesh Gupta contended that the failure to implead the appellant's son in the suit is fatal for her case. He averred that once it was established that the payments to the respondents were authorised, and also the fact that there was a settlement, the case of the appellant fell flat.  Analysis of the Supreme Court  The Court observed that the respondents admitted that they had received Rs. 10,50,000 from the appellant, but claimed that the full and final settlement was for an amount of Rs. 5,00,000. It opined that when the full and final settlement was of a lesser amount than the admitted principal amount received from the appellant, the burden to establish that there was a settlement was cast upon the respondents. It further noted that oral evidence of third party mediators would not suffice, especially when there is no written memorandum of compromise/settlement.  "There was also no written memorandum of compromise/settlement. When payment of a certain amount of money and the repayment of only a portion of the same are admitted, the party pleading that such a part repayment was in full and final settlement, has a huge burden cast upon him to show that there was a settlement. Oral evidence of the so called third party mediators, is not sufficient to establish full and final settlement, in cases of this nature, where all transactions have happened only through banking channels and the defendants claimed that there were business transactions."  The Court observed that with respect to the second suit, the defence of the respondents was that the money received by the appellant was with respect to an investment in real estate business. Out of this amount, Rs. 30,00,000 was a payment made by the appellant and her son to the respondents out of love and affection and an affidavit signed by the appellant's son to this effect was adduced as evidence. The Court opined that the onus was on the respondents to show that there were business transactions and the money was accounted for, which it had utterly failed to do.   "In a suit for recovery of money, a defendant admitting the receipt of money but pleading that the same was a gratuitous payment, is obliged to prove that it was a gratuitous payment."   Further, on perusal of the affidavit dated 08.03.2006, the Court found that there was a material contradiction, as it stated that there was no transaction between the appellant and the respondents, but the respondents on 07.08.2006, made a full and final settlement.

The Supreme Court observed that a Consumer Commission has no jurisdiction to condone the delay for filing opposite party's written version beyond the prescribed period of 15 days mentioned in the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in this case, the opposite party filed written statement (version) beyond the period of 45 days. The Commission refused to condone the delay by observing thus: "Time for filing the Written Version as provided under Section 13 (1) (a) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 now replaced by Section 38 (2) (a) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 which is in force since 20/24.07.2020 has expired. This Commission does not have the power to condone the delay beyond 30 + 15 days as provided in the statute. Right of Opposite Party No.2 to file the Written Version stands closed." Aggreived with this order, the opposite party approached the Apex Court by filing a Special Leave Petition (SLP). "It is not in dispute that the written statement was filed beyond the period of 45 days. The period of limitation to file is 30 days which can be condoned up to 15 days only. As observed and held by this Court in the case of New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd. (2020) 5 SCC 757, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond the prescribed period mentioned in the Statute.", the bench of Justices MR Shah and MM Sundresh observed while dismissing the SLP. In Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Private Limited, the Constitution Bench held that Consumer Protection Act 1986 did not empower the Consumer Forum to extend the time beyond the period of 45 days. The time period prescribed under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act is mandatory, and not directory, the court had held. It also observed that the timeline will start from the time that notice along with complaint is received and not just notice. Last year, in Dr. A Suresh Kumar vs. Amit Agarwal, the court held that this law declared by the Constitution Bench operates only prospectively.

The Rajasthan High Court has held that a writ petition filed in representative capacity without proper authorization or resolution is not maintainable.

The Rajasthan High Court has held that a writ petition filed in representative capacity without proper authorization or resolution is not maintainable.  A division bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani, observed, "We are of the firm view that the writ petition has been filed without proper authorization/resolution and hence, the same is not maintainable."  In furtherance, the court dismissed the writ petition purportedly filed on behalf of Income Tax Contingent Employees Union as not maintainable, in the absence of proper authorization.  The court relied on a similar issue dealt by the High Court in Income Tax Contingent Employees Union v. A.n. Jha, Finance Secretary [Writ Petition No.2893/2019], wherein writ petition filed by the petitioner Union through its so-called President was dismissed.  In the present case, a writ petition was filed in representative capacity on behalf of a Union posed as Income Tax Contingent Employees Union. The affidavit in support of the writ petition was also sworn by one Kamal Pal claiming to be the Member and an authorised person of the aforesaid Union.  Thereafter, an application was preferred by Advocate Sunil Bhandari, representing the respondents, seeking dismissal of the writ petition on the ground of it having been filed without proper authorization.  The court found that the minutes of the meeting referred to by petitioners does not bear signatures of any of the Members of the Union. The court further observed that no list of the Members of the Union has been annexed with the writ petition.  The court added that Jagdish Solanki, claiming to be President of the Union, has authorised Kamal Pal to file the matters on behalf of the Union in the courts. However, no resolution of the Union has been filed on record on the strength whereof, Shri Jagdish Solanki has been authorised to further authorise Shri Kamal Pal to file the Original Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal or the instant writ petition.  Appearing for the respondents, Adv. Sunil Bhandari contended that no list of the casual labour who are alleged to be Members of the Union, has been annexed with the writ petition. He further argued that no proper authorization/resolution passed by the so-called Union for the purpose of filing the Original Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal or the writ petition before this Court has been placed on record.  He submitted that this Court has held that such writ petitions are not maintainable for lack of proper authorization. In furtherance, he relied on the order dated 17.11.2011 passed in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.2893/2019 "Income Tax Contingent Employees Union & Anr. Vs. A.N. Jha & Anr." and the order dated 9.7.2019 passed in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.3798/2019 "Income Tax Contingent Employees Union Vs. Union of India & Ors."  Representing the petitioners, Adv. T.C. Gupta vehemently relied upon the document claiming that in the meeting dated 20.3.2015, the Union authorised him to file the cases on behalf of the Union. He further urged that in the meeting dated 11.4.2018, Shri Kamal Pal had been authorised to plead the matters on behalf of the Union. He also submitted that the writ petition has been presented and is being pursued under proper authorization.  Case Title: Income- Tax Contigent Employees Union and Anr. v.

The Supreme Court held that the onerous condition of payment of 50% of the amount awarded to file appeal against NCDRC order will not be applicable to the complaints filed prior to the commencement of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The consumer complaint, in this case, was filed before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission before the 2019 Act came into force. But the NCDRC allowed the complaint on 27.1.2021, whereas the 2019 Act came into force from 20.7.2020. NCDRC Can Direct Deposit Of Entire Or More Than 50% Of Amount Determined By SCDRC For Stay : Supreme Court  So the question before the Apex Court bench was whether the appeal before it would be governed under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 or under the erstwhile 1986 Act. This issue became relevant since, in terms of Section 67 of the 2019 Act, no appeal against the order of National Commission shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless the person has deposited fifty per cent of the amount required to be paid. Whereas, under the 1986 Act, the condition was that no appeal shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless the person who is required to pay the amount deposits fifty per cent of the amount or fifty thousand, whichever is less.  Before the Apex court, it was contended that the law which is applicable at the time of initiation of the lis would be applicable, and therefore the provisions of 1986 Act would govern the present appeal and not the provisions of 2019 Act. Opposing this, the respondent contended that the amendment is procedural in nature and thus always retrospective. In its judgment, the bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian refers to and discusses various judgments, including those by Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, to finally conclude thus: "34. In view of the binding precedents of the Constitution Bench judgments referred to above, we hold that onerous condition of payment of 50% of the amount awarded will not be applicable to the complaints filed prior to the commencement of the 2019 Act."

The Allahabad High Court has observed that if the order of taking cognizance has been passed on the first page of the charge-sheet in the hand writing not by filling up the proforma then the summoning order carried on the order-sheet on printed proforma won't be invalid. The bench of Justice Mohd. Aslam clarified that if after taking cognizance of the police charge sheet by way of a written order, summons is issued on the printed proforma, then it cannot be said that the cognizance order is a proforma order. The Court was dealing with a Section 482 CrPC plea filed by the applicants seeking to quash the cognizance order passed by the Additional Civil Judge (SD)/Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, J.P. Nagar. Essentially, the cognizance was taken against the applicants/accused on the basis of charge-sheet submitted by police and summons was issued to them for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and section ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act. It was their primary submisison that since cognizance was taken on the chargesheet and later on it was drawn on the printed proforma of the order sheet, therefore, it can be said that the cognizance was taken on printed proforma, which is impermissable in law. Discarding their submisison that it was a cognizance order passed on the proform, the Court observed thus: "...the order of taking cognizance was passed on the first page of the charge-sheet in the hand writing not by filling up the proforma and the summoning order carried on the order-sheet on printed proforma by itself cannot be said that the cognizance order was passed on printed proforma...In this case as the cognizance order was passed on the chargesheet and later on carried out on the order sheet, therefore, it cannot be said that the cognizance order was carried out on the printed proforma, therefore, it cannot be said that the order for taking cognizance was passed on printed proforma." The case in brief Complainant/Anushka aka Bharti Singh got married to one Amitesh Singh on 6 February 2017. Allegedly, in this marriage, her parents incurred an amount of Rs.20 lacs including household articles and a cheque of Rs.1,51,000/-. However, even after this, her husband, father-in-law, motherin-law, (Jeth), (Jethani) were not pleased with the dowry given in her marriage.  Immediately after the marriage, they started demanding Rs.10 lacs cash in dowry and her husband also demanded that Car which was given in her marriage and registered in her name be transferred in the name of her husband. The opposite party no.2/complainant tried to convince them, but they didn't not agree and started harassing her financially, mentally and physically and assaulting her due to non-fulfilment of the demand of dowry. Soon her husband left her and therefore, she also went to her paternal home. One day her in-laws came there and beat her up. A complaint was lodged at Mahila Police Station Amroha, however, no action was taken. Thereafter, she moved an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Amroha and on the order of the court, the first information report was lodged. Having perused the first information report, injury report and the statement of the informant and witnesses, the Court noted that prima-facie case punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and Section ¾ of Dowry Prohibition Act was made out against the applicants. Therefore, their 482 CrPC plea was dismissed. Case Title - Smt. Kiran Kunwar And 2 Others v. State of U.P. and Another [APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 15581 of 2019]

Referring to the Apex Court's ruling in the case of Rajnesh v. Neha and another, (2021) 2 SCC 324, the Allahabad High Court has observed that the maintenance has to be awarded from the date of application and not from the date of the order. The Bench of Justice Samit Gopal observed thus as it opined that the order of the revisional court in granting maintenance to a lady and her minor children from the date of the order was illegal. Essentially, the Court was hearing the revision plea filed in the year 2005 seeking modification of the judgment and order dated April 1, 2005, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Aligarh.  The revisional court had modified the order dated 31.8.2002 to the extent that Rs. 1000/- per month be given to the revisionist and Rs. 400/- per month be given to her minor children from the date of order.  In view of this, the Court observed that the view as taken by the revisional court of granting Rs.1000/- per month to the revisionist and Rs. 400/- to her minor children from the date of the order was illegal.  In this regard, the Court, at the outset, referred to the ruling of the Apex Court in the case of Rajnesh Vs. Neha and another, wherein it was held that the maintenance has to be awarded from the date of application. Further, in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Rajnesh, the present criminal revision was partly allowed and the judgement and order passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Aligarh was set aside, in so far as it issued a direction for payment of maintenance from the date of order.  The opposite party no. 2/Yogesh Gautam was directed to pay a sum of Rs.1000/- per month to the revisionist/wife and Rs. 400/- to her minor children, from the date of application.  The Court directed that the payment shall be done within a period of six months and the arrears of payment to be paid within six months in three equal instalment, the first instalment of which shall be paid within a period of one month and the remaining two instalment shall be paid within equally divided in the remaining time.  In related news, the Jharkhand High Court recently held that the claim for maintenance arises from the date of filing the application and not the date of judgment.  Justice Anubha Rawat Choudhary referred to the Supreme Court Decision in Rajnesh v. Neha & Anr. and modified the impugned order, directing payment of monthly allowance from the date of application.

Thereafter, the accused... The Supreme Court observed that an absconder/proclaimed offender is not entitled to relief of anticipatory bail. In this case, the Trial Court dismissed the  anticipatory bail application on the ground that as the accused is absconding and even the proceedings under section 82/83 Cr.PC have been issued, the accused is not entitled to the anticipatory bail. Thereafter, the accused approached the High Court which granted the anticipatory bail. In appeal , the state relied upon the judgment in case of State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Pradeep Sharma reported in (2014) 2 SCC 171,to contend that a person against whom the proclamation has been issued and the proceedings under sections 82-­83 of Cr.PC have been initiated, is not entitled to the benefit of anticipatory bail. The court noted that the High Court ignored the factum of initiation of proceedings under sections 82-­83 of Cr.PC by simply observing that "be that as it may". "In the case of State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Pradeep Sharma (Supra), it is observed and held by this court that if anyone is declared as an absconder/proclaimed offender in terms of section 82 of Cr.PC, he is not entitled to relief of anticipatory bail", the bench comprising Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna observed. The bench further observed that even in the case of a business transaction also there may be offences under the IPC more particularly sections 406, 420, 467, 468, etc. What is required to be considered is the nature of allegation and the accusation and not that the nature of accusation is arising out of a business transaction, the court observed while allowing the appeal. Case no. and Date: CrA 1209 OF 2021 | 21 October 2021 Coram: Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna    
The Supreme Court commuted death sentence of a murder accused taking into account his illegal solitary confinement for about ten years. BA Umesh alias Umesh Reddy, an ex-cop, was sentenced to death in a rape and murder case by a Sessions Court in Bengaluru upon being convicted in the year 2006. He was found guilty of rape and murder of a house wife. Later, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence awarded to him in year 2011. The mercy petition was rejected by the President of India and challenging the same he approached the Karnataka High Court. As the writ petition filed by him got dismissed, he approached the Apex Court. Before the Apex Court, it was contended that from 2006 till 2016, he was kept in solitary confinement in "Andheri Block" in violation of the judgment in Sunil Batra vs. Delhi Administration & Ors (1978) 4 SCC 494. He also relied on the decision in Ajay Kumar Pal vs Union of India 2015 (2) SCC 478 in which segregation of the concerned petitioner, from the day he was awarded death sentence till his mercy petition was disposed of, was taken to be in violation of the law laid down by this Court in Sunil Batra and the death sentence was commuted. Taking note of this contention and other relevant records produced before it, the court observed: "Having considered the entirety of matter, in our view, the impact of solitary confinement were obviously evident in the instant case, as would be clear from the letter given by the medical professional on 6.11.2011 and the communication emanating from the jail on 8.11.2011. The incarceration in solitary confinement thus did show ill effects on the well-being of the appellant. In the backdrop of these features of the matter, in our view, the appellant is entitled to have the death sentence imposed upon him to be commuted to death sentence to life. The court thus commuted the death sentence to sentence of life imprisonment with a rider that he shall undergo minimum sentence of 30 years. "If any application for remission is moved on his behalf, the same shall be considered on its own merits only after he has undergone actual sentence of 30 years. If no remission is granted, it goes without saying that as laid down by this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse vs. State of Maharashtra, the sentence of imprisonment for life shall mean till the remainder of his life", the court added.

The Karnataka High Court has observed that as per Rule 214 (2) (b)(ii) of the Karnataka Civil Services Rules, no enquiry can be initiated against a retired person in respect of an event which had taken place more than four years prior to institution of enquiry.  A single judge bench of Justice SG Pandit allowed the petition filed by Anil Kumar and T. Mallanna, former employees of Karnataka Housing Board, and quashed the Charge Memo as well as appointment of Enquiry Officer.  The bench noted that petitioners retired on 30.06.2018 and 31.08.2020 respectively on attaining the age of superannuation. The charge memo dated 21.06.2022 was issued subsequent to retirement of petitioners. The Charge is against an incident which had taken place in the year 2006.  Then referring to Rule 214 (2)(b)(ii) of the KCSR the bench said, "The above Rule which is applicable to the employees of KHB would not permit initiation of enquiry in respect of an event which took place more than 4 years before such institution in respect of a retired employee." The petitioners had contended that the charge Memo is barred under KCSR and it is thus liable to be set aside.  However, the government counsel opposed the petition by saying that initially enquiry was initiated against the petitioners while they were in service but they were exonerated of the Charges. Subsequently, on the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee, the present proceedings were initiated. Thus, there is a continuation of the cause of action.  The Court said, "In the case on hand, initiation of enquiry and issuance of Charge Memo dated 21.06.2022 (Annexure-C) is in respect of an event which took place more than 4 years before such institution against retired petitioners. Thus, the institution of enquiry under Charge Memo is barred by Rule 214 (2)(b)(ii) of KCSRs. Thus, the Charge Memo is not sustainable in law."  Case Title: ANIL KUMAR & ANR v.

The Supreme Court observed that interim victim compensation cannot be imposed as a condition for bail. "Victim compensation is simultaneous with the final view taken in respect of the alleged offence, i.e., whether it was so committed or not and, thus, there is no question of any imposition pre-finality of the matter pre-trial", the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Abhay S Oka observed. The bench was allowing an appeal filed against Jharkhand High Court order. The High Court while granting anticipatory bail to a person accused of offence under Section 498A IPC ordered that 'in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of four months from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on depositing a demand draft of Rs. 4,00,000/- as ad interim victim compensation drawn in favour of complainant'. Terming this as 'judicial misadventure;, the Apex court bench noted that recently in Dharmesh v. State of Gujarat (2021) 7 SCC 198, it was opined that it was clear from the plain reading of Section 357 that such compensation can only arise after the conclusion of trial albeit, of course, the same being a matter of discretion. "The High Court’s direction to the accused for deposit of compensation for the legal heirs of the deceased (victim), as a condition for the bail cannot be sustained and, thus, logically set aside. . The Court opined that the objective is clear that in cases of offences against body, compensation to the victim should be methodology for redemption. Similarly, to prevent unnecessary harassment, compensation has been provided where meaningless criminal proceedings had been started. Such a compensation can hardly be determined at the stage of grant of bail.", the bench observed while setting aside the condition imposed by the High Court.

Observing that he did not act in a cruel or unusual manner, the Bombay High Court recently reduced the sentence of a man who killed his wife for not cooking meat properly.  The court held that this was a case of sudden quarrel without any premeditation. Therefore, the court convicted him under section 304 Part I (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC and reduced his sentence to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.  "Admittedly, the accused had not prepared for the assault. When he saw that the deceased had not prepared the food, he abused and assaulted her. The weapon used in the present case is a lethal weapon like stick. In this view of the matter, we find that the appellant had knowledge that injuries could cause death of the deceased. There was an intention on the part of the accused to cause injuries. However, the accused had not taken undue advantage or has not acted in a cruel or unusual manner.…. the act of the accused would cover under exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, the case of the accused would cover under Section 304 Part-I of the Indian Penal Code."  Justice Rohit B Deo and Justice Urmila Joshi-Phalke of the Nagpur bench were dealing with a criminal appeal against the man's conviction under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC. He was originally sentenced to life imprisonment.   The court said that this incident is covered under the exception 4 of section 300 (murder) of the IPC which provides that culpable homicide would not be murder if it is committed without premeditation upon a sudden quarrel.  The court cited psychiatrist Sydeny Brandon's book 'Violence in Family' in which he wrote, "Statistically it is safer to be on streets after dark with a stranger than at home in the bosom of one's family, for it is there that accident, murder and violence are likely to occur".  The present case is one more example of such type of violence in the house, the court said.  The prosecution's case was that the accused, who drank habitually, used to beat his wife. A neighbour and relative of the appellant saw him quarrelling with his wife and assaulting her with kicks and fists because she did not cook meat properly and burnt it. Later, the said neighbour saw the appellant's wife lying dead and approached the police.  During the trial, four prosecution witnesses including the appellant's daughter turned hostile. The informant supported the prosecution's case only to some extent. The appellant was found guilty. Hence the present appeal.  The medical evidence showed several external injuries on the face and chest of the victim as well as internal injuries on the lungs, ribs, heart, pancreas and spleen. The cause of death was "Cardiogenic Shock" due to injury to vital organ.  The appellant denied the offence. His defence was that his wife was suffering from epilepsy. She had a stroke on the day of the incident and fell on the ground sustaining injuries.  The court noted the there is no eye-witness and the entire case of the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence. The court reiterated that circumstantial evidence should unerringly point towards the guilt of the accused.  The clothes of the accused were found to be stained with human blood. However, no opportunity was given to the accused to explain this. Therefore, the court ignored this evidence.  The court from the witness testimonies noted that the neighbours saw the deceased and the appellant together prior to her death. The appellant was seen abusing and assaulting his wife because she had not prepared the meat properly. Subsequently, she was found dead and the appellant did not offer any explanation. A stick was found at the spot of the incident. A witness also saw burnt utensils containing meat curry.  The defence of the accused that the disease fell on the ground due to epilepsy stroke was ruled out by the medical evidence, the court said.  The evidence sufficiently shows that the death was homicidal and was caused in the appellant's house due to his assault on her for not preparing the food properly, the court concluded.  The court noted that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation on the part of the appellant. The injuries were not on vital parts of the wife's body. The court said that the evidence does not show that the appellant acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Therefore, the court set aside the murder conviction and convicted him for culpable homicide.

The Madras High Court invalidated the reassessment procedures on the basis that the reopening of the income tax assessment was conducted by an officer without jurisdiction.The division bench of Justice R.

The Madras High Court invalidated the reassessment procedures on the basis that the reopening of the income tax assessment was conducted by an officer without jurisdiction. The division bench of Justice R. Mahadevan and Justice J.Sathya Narayana Prasad has observed that the ACIT Mumbai, who recorded the reasons for reopening the assessment, has no jurisdiction over the appellant, to issue a notice dated 28.03.2018. Though the files pertaining to the reassessment proceedings of the appellant were transferred, the ACIT Chennai has no authority to continue the reassessment proceedings. Hence, the notice issued by him was also held to be invalid.  The appellant was an assessee on the file of the ACIT at Chennai. For the assessment year 2011-2012, the assessee filed her return of income on 19.04.2012, admitting an income of Rs.11,60,000/-, which was processed by the Assessing Officer under Section 143 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.   After a period of five years, the assessee received a notice dated March 28, 2018 issued by the ACIT Mumbai under Section 148 purportedly to re-assess the income tax return submitted by her for the assessment year 2011-2012.   In response, the assessee submitted a reply dated 26.04.2018 stating that the ACIT Mumbai has no jurisdiction to issue a reassessment notice. Therefore, the assessee requested to drop the reassessment proceedings. Subsequently, the ACIT Mumbai transferred the files pertaining to the appellant to the ACIT Chennai.  The ACIT Chennai continued the reassessment proceedings by issuing a notice dated 12.12.2018 directing the appellant to appear and file a return of income along with supportive documents.   The assessee was aggrieved by the notices and filed the appeal.  The department contended that the appellant had received an amount towards her share in respect of the property in Mumbai from a developer within the jurisdiction of the ACIT Mumbai. Therefore, a notice under section 148 of the Act was issued by the ACIT Mumbai. When the appellant raised an issue of jurisdiction, the entire materials collected by the ACIT Mumbai were sent to the ACIT Chennai for continuing the reassessment proceedings. Accordingly, the ACIT Chennai seized of the reassessment proceedings within whose jurisdiction the appellant resides.  The single judge observed that the notice initially issued by the ACIT Mumbai against the appellant through improper, need not be set aside. The proceedings were subsequently transferred to the Income Tax Authorities at Chennai; the commencement of the proceedings by issuing a notice dated 14.12.2018 in no way prejudiced the appellant. The appellant was at liberty to file her objections and avail herself of an opportunity of hearing. The court dismissed the writ petition.  The appellant challenged the order of the single judge bench.  The appellant contended that the ACIT Mumbai lacked jurisdiction to begin reassessment proceedings by issuing the notice dated March 28, 2018.The ACIT Mumbai was aware that the appellant was not residing within the jurisdiction of the ACIT Mumbai. After a period of five years from the completion of the original assessment for the assessment year 2011-2012, the reassessment proceedings were initiated. It alleged that some of the income was not disclosed by the appellant truly and fully. However, there was no income omitted to be included by the appellant for assessment during the assessment year in question. Therefore, the reassessment proceedings ought not to have been initiated by the ACIT Mumbai against the appellant.  The court held that the notice issued by the ACIT Mumbai under section 148 as well as the consequential notice issued by the ACIT Chennai cannot be allowed to be sustained.   The court held that the single judge bench erred in directing the ACIT Chennai to continue the reassessment proceedings.   "In such circumstances, there is no requirement for this court to go into the other issue based on the factual matrix projected by the appellant, i.e., whether the appellant has disclosed fully and truly all the material particulars that are necessary for assessment for the relevant assessment year," the court said.

Observing that vehicular toll is a tax and not merely contractual debt between the collection company and the civic body, the Bombay High Court dismissed plea by Mumbai based MEP Infrastructure Developers Ltd. (MEPIDL) challenging recovery proceedings for its failure to pay toll collected by it to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). “MEPIDL was collecting and remitting toll. The question, therefore, is not whether MEPIDL was doing so under contract but what is it that it was collecting and remitting because it is this amount that is sought to be recovered. Toll is undoubtedly a tax. It is so defined. The statute so says. Even the Bye-laws make this abundantly clear. This completely answers the first aspect of the matter; and there is no question of limiting the recovery to a contractual debt”, the court held. A division bench of Justices G. S. Patel and S.G. Dige further held that once Tehsildar has directed a bank to freeze the accounts of a defaulter against whom recovery certificate is issued, the bank has no power to invite objections from the defaulter. “The bank has no authority in law to invite suggestions and objections from a defaulter against whom there is a Revenue Recovery Certificate. Once the Tahsildar has issued a notice to freeze the account, the bank must comply, and it is then for the defaulter to apply to a Court or an authority to have that account released from freezing”, the court held. MCD contracted out the task of toll tax collection to MEPIDL. Claiming that MEPIDL did not make the required remittances and a large amount is due, MCD terminated the contract. Delhi HC dismissed MEPIDL’s challenge to the termination. The MCD claimed that as of April 10, 2021, MEPIDL owed about 4000 crores which has since increased. It issued distress warrants to recover the amount. MEPIDL challenged one distress warrant before Delhi HC but no stay was granted. MEPIDL has no assets in Delhi. Hence, MCD requested the local authorities to issue notice of attachment of MEPIDL’s movable and immovable assets within the jurisdiction of the Bombay HC. The Kalyan Janata Sahakari Bank Ltd., instead of implementing Tehsildar’s notice to freeze MEPIDL’s account, issued it a show-cause notice. In rival writ petitions, MEPIDL challenged the distress warrants and attachment notices while MCD challenged the action of the Bank. The court granted MCD’s prayers. The court found the action of the bank “indefensible” and directed the bank to recall the show-cause notice. Court also restrained the bank from issuing any communication to MEPIDL that may cause it to remove its money from the account. Senior Advocate Venkatesh Dhond with Advocate Rashmin Khandekar for MEPIDL contended that MCD’s claim is not a tax but simply a contractual debt payable under the contract. Further, the distress warrant must be confined to property which is located in Delhi. The court said that toll is a tax as defined by the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (DMC Act) and Toll Tax Bye-Laws. Hence, there is no question of limiting the recovery to a contractual debt, the court held. Section 156(1) of the DMC Act provides the mode for recovery of tax in case of default via distress and sale of movable property or attachment and sale of immovable property of the defaulter. Section 157(1) provides that MCD may distrain any property of the defaulter described in this section in any place in Delhi subject to certain exceptions. The court said that section 157 is an empowering provision. It does not constrain section 156 which does not have any such geographical limitation. The court said that if MEPIDL’s submission is accepted, then it would mean that MCD can never engage a contractor who has no property in Delhi and if it does engage such a contractor, the contractor would be immune to recovery. The court termed this interpretation of Section 156 “absurd and untenable”. Section 455 of the DMC Act provides for recovery of “certain dues” as arrears of tax. The court said that it must be read with section 156. An arrear of tax can be recovered in the manner given in section 156 and there is no geographical limitation in section 455 either, the court concluded. The court noted that section 455 is a residuary provision applicable in any case not otherwise covered in the Act or Bye Laws. Thus, even if the claim were merely a contractual claim as contended by MEPIDL, it would still come under section 455 as a “certain due”, the court held. The court said that once the Tehsildar has received the Revenue Recovery Certificate, there is no need to satisfy himself and he must act on it. Section 3(3) of the Revenue Recovery Act does not provide for discretion of the Tehsildar, the court said. Hence, the court held that Tehsildar has not acted illegally. Merely because it is uncomfortable for MEPIDL is not a ground to interfere. Further, if this is a purely contractual dispute as claimed by MEPIDL, the remedy doesn’t lie in writ court, the court stated. The court said that MEPIDL is trying to stymie the recovery proceedings after failing to get any relief from Delhi HC. “The entire trajectory of this is to be deprecated. When a principle challenge against the termination fails and while an appeal is pending, one distress warrant is challenged in Delhi only to be allegedly later withdrawn and other distress warrants are now brought before this Court”, the court observed.

Referring to a Supreme Court's Judgment delivered in 2021, the Allahabad High Court has observed that fixing notional income at Rs.15,000/- per annum for a family's non-earning members is not just and reasonable. The Bench of Justice Dr. Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Ajai Tyagi was hearing an appeal filed by the parents of a 7-year-old deceased boy, seeking enhancement of quantum, against Motor Accident Claims Tribunal's order awarding Rs.1,80,000 as compensation with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum. The matter in brief  In March 2018, claimant Roop Lal was walking with his son and at that time, a truck, being driven very rashly and negligently by its driver, hit the son of the appellant from behind due to which he fell on the road and front wheel of the truck ran over him.  The 7-year-old boy sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. Thereafter, in the Motor Accident Claim, filed by the appellant/claimant, a sum of Rs.1,80,000 as compensation was awarded. Feeling aggrieved by the same, the father moved to High Court. The accident was not in dispute. The issue of negligence had been decided in favor of the appellants/claimant and the Insurance Company did not challenge the liability imposed on it by the Tribunal. The only issue left to be decided was the quantum of compensation. Court's observations At the outste, the Court referred to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Kurvan Ansari alias Kurvan Ali & Anr. v. Shyam Kishore Murmu & Anr. LL 2021 SC 655 wherein the Court had decided the controversy and settled the law in the case of the death of a child. "In this case, the Hon'ble Apex Court has stated that in spite of repeated directions, Scheduled-II of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is not yet amended. Therefore, fixing notional income of Rs.15,000/- per annum for non-earning members is not just and reasonable," the Court observed. It may further be noted that the Apex Court in the Kurvan Ansari case had further observed that in view of the judgments in the cases of Puttamma and others Vs. K.L. Narayana Reddy and another, 2014 (1) TAC 926 and Kishan Gopal and another v. Lala and others, 2013 (4) TAC 5, it is a fit case to increase the notional income by taking into account the inflation, devaluation of the rupees and cost of living. "With the aforesaid observations, the Hon'ble Apex Court took the notional income of the deceased at Rs.25,000/- per annum, hence we are of the considered view that notional income of the deceased must be assumed Rs.25,000/- per annum as he was non-earning member," the High Court finally held as it enhanced the compensation to Rs. 4,70,000 with interest at the rate of 7.5% from the date of filing of the claim petition till the amount is deposited. The respondent-Insurance Company has been directed to deposit the amount within a period of 08 weeks from today with interest at the rate of 7.5% from the date of filing of the claim petition till the amount is deposited.

There is no bar for someone who is pursuing higher studies, to start a business, the Supreme Court observed while upholding an eviction order passed on the ground of bonafide requirement/need. In this case, the landlord sought eviction of the tenant on two grounds: One, wilful default in payment of rent and two, bona fide requirement of the premises for the own use of the landlord. The applicable law was Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960.  The Rent Control Appellate Authority passed an eviction order. However, the said order was set aside by the Andhra Pradesh High Court observing that the eldest son of the Landlord was still pursuing studies and therefore the requirement of the land lord was not bona fide. "There is no bar for someone who is pursuing higher studies, to start a business. The High Court, for a moment did not realize that it was dealing with a revision, where its jurisdiction was limited", the bench of Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and V. Ramasubramanian observed. The court noted that the Appellate Authority had found that the landlord was carrying on business and that he had children for whom he wanted to set-up a business. Thus, the bench restored the eviction order passed by the Rent Control Authority and set aside the High Court order. However, it gave the tenant six months' time to vacate the property and handover the vacant possession.

The Supreme Court recently reiterated that unless there is a specific bar under the contract, it is always open for the Arbitrator to award pendente lite interest in view of Section 31(7)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. The Court also set aside orders passed by High Court, for having exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by setting aside a well-reasoned Arbitral Award. It has been further held that the Arbitral Tribunal is open to award pendente lite interest unless there is a specific bar under the contract.  The Bench comprising of Justice M.R. Shah and Justice M.M. Sundresh, while adjudicating an appeal filed in Indian Railway Construction Company Limited v M/s National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited, has affirmed the Award wherein the Arbitral Tribunal, after finding out that the Agreement has been terminated under wrong clause, determined the correct clause for termination and justified the termination. The Bench has also affirmed the grant of pendente lite interest by the Arbitral Tribunal without there being an express provision in the Agreement.  BACKGROUND FACTS In 1990, Indian Railway Construction Company Limited (“IRCON”) entered into an Agreement with M/s. National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited (“NBCC”) for construction of Railway Station cum Commercial Complex at Vashi, Navi Mumbai. The Clause 17.4 of the Agreement provided for termination of Agreement and forfeiture of security deposit, in case the work is not carried out by NBCC within stipulated timelines and given extensions. Further, Clause 60.1 empowered IRCON to rescind the Agreement in case the contractor (NBCC) abandons the contract.   NBCC failed to complete the construction work in time. Accordingly, IRCON terminated the Agreement on 21.02.1994 by invoking Clause 60.1 of the same and forfeited two security deposits of NBCC. NBCC referred the dispute to arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal passed an Award in 2011, rejecting NBCC’s claim for refund of two security deposits i.e. Claim No. 33 and 34. The Tribunal held that the termination was valid in view of Clause 17.4 of the Agreement and not Clause 60.1 as pleaded by IRCON. The Tribunal also considered the counter claim of IRCON and awarded 18% p.a. pendente lite interest on special advance given by IRCON to NBCC.   NBCC challenged the Award before the High Court and the Single Judge set aside the rejection of Claim No. 33 and 34 by the Arbitral Tribunal on 03.03.2017. The Single Judge concluded that once the Arbitral Tribunal found that the termination under Clause 60.1 was unjustified, it was not open for them to consider the termination under Clause 17.4, justifying forfeiture of the security deposits. The Single Judge further set aside the award of pendente lite interest on special advance, on the ground that the Agreement did not contain any clause for such interest.  Under appeal, on 14.08.2018 the Division Bench of the High Court affirmed the stand taken by Single Judge.  Aggrieved by the Order dated 14.08.2018, IRCON filed an appeal before the Supreme Court, contending that even if a wrong clause is mentioned in the Termination letter, the power to terminate the contract cannot be said to be illegal. SUPREME COURT VERDICT Substitution of correct clause of termination by Arbitral Tribunal  The Bench affirmed the determination done by Arbitral Tribunal with respect to the correct clause of termination and as to whether the Agreement could be rescinded by IRCON under Clause 60.1 or Clause 17.4. IRCON being satisfied that the NBCC would not be able to complete the work even with further extension, had rightly rescinded the Agreement and forfeited the security deposits. It was held that the Agreement could justifiably be terminated under both Clause 60.1 and Clause 17.4. Further, the Arbitral Tribunal’s finding regarding rescinding of the contract under Clause 17.4 has not been set aside by either the Single Judge and Division Bench of the High Court. Therefore, the findings on Clause 17.4 attained finality.  A well-reasoned Award cannot be set aside u/s 34 of Arbitration Act The Bench held as under: “At the cost of repetition it is observed that the learned Arbitral Tribunal on appreciation of entire evidence on record, had specifically observed that the contractor failed to complete the work even within the stipulated extended period of time and even abandoned the work and therefore, the IRCON was justified in rescinding the contract. The said finding as observed hereinabove has attained finality……….We are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge, therefore, exceeded in its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act quashing and setting aside the well­reasoned award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on rejecting Claim Nos.33 and 34, which the Division Bench of the High Court has wrongly affirmed.” The orders passed by Single Judge and Division Bench of High Court have been set aside by the Supreme Court, while observing that the Single Judge exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act by setting aside a well-reasoned Award passed by Arbitral Tribunal.

The Karnataka High Court, while dismissing the appeal of the department, held that payroll services by IBM Philippines are not fees for technical services (FTS), and the TDS is not liable to be deducted. The division bench of Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar and Justice T.G. Shivashankare Gowda has observed that the work has been outsourced to IBM Philippines. IBM Philippines was carrying out the work described in the agreement between IBM India and P&G India. Hence, IBM Philippines was not rendering any technical service, and therefore, the income in the hands of IBM Philippines is a business income. The respondent/assessee is a company engaged in the business of information technology services. IBM USA had entered into a global agreement with P&G USA to provide payroll-related services. In terms of a companion agreement, IBM India had entered into an agreement with P&G India. The services to be rendered by IBM India to P&G India were outsourced to IBM Philippines. In addition, IBM India had also outsourced certain human resource services to IBM Philippines for the project. The AO recorded that the assessee had made payments to IBM Business Services, Philippines, for payroll services without deducting tax at source. The AO concluded that, in respect of payments made towards FTS, TDS ought to have been deducted under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The assessee was treated as an "assessee in default" under Section 201. The CIT (A) confirmed the AO’s order. The assessee challenged the order before the ITAT. The ITAT has allowed the appeal, holding that the payments made by the assessee were not chargeable to tax under the India-Philippines DTAA and, hence, no tax was required to be deducted. The department contended that the service rendered by IBM Philippines falls under the category of managerial and consulting services. Data management is also one of the services rendered, and it would fall under the category of "technical services." The ITAT incorrectly interpreted IBM Philippines' services as being in the course of business, and the payment received is business profit in the hands of IBM Philippines.The ITAT has proceeded to hold that FTS is not defined under the DTAA. However, the definition of FTS cannot be applied in view of Section 90 of the Act. The ITAT has failed to consider that the services rendered by IBM Philippines are technical in nature as per Explanation 2 to Section 9(1)(vii), and therefore, the income is deemed to accrue in India under Section 5(2)(b) of the Act. The assessee contended that, in terms of the companion agreement, IBM India has entered into an agreement with P&G India, and IBM India has outsourced the services to be rendered by IBM Philippines. IBM Philippines was not rendering any technical service to IBM India. For the services rendered to P&G India on behalf of the assessee, the assessee paid the service charges to IBM Philippines. Therefore, it was "income earned" in the hands of IBM Philippines. As per Section 90(2), the provisions of the Act or DTAA, whichever is more beneficial to the assessee, have to be applied. The court has held that the payments received by IBM Philippines shall not be liable for TDS under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act. As a result, the assessee cannot be considered an "assessee in default."

The Allahabad High Court recently granted bail to an accused booked for committing an Aggravated Sexual Assault (punishable under Section 10 of the POCSO Act) upon a 8 year old girl as her parents refused to get her medically examined. The bench of Justice Sadhna Rani (Thakur) granted bail to accused Manoj Saxena taking into account the larger mandate of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the Apex Court's dictum in the case of Dataram Singh v. State of U.P. and another (2018) 2 SCC 22 The case in brief As per the FIR in the case, in the absence of other family members of the 8-year-old victim, the accused, a dish repairing technician, visited the victim's house and seeing the victim alone, started vulgar activities with her. The victim made hue and cry then that is how he ran away from the house.  In her statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.PC, the victim stated that when the accused came in her house, to repair the dish connection, he inserted his hand in her clothes and kissed her on the lips.  As per her statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., the victim alleged that the accused held her tightly and kissed her lips, inserted his hand into her panty, and also pressed her breast by inserting her hands therein.  The Accused was booked under Sections 376A, B, 354 I.P.C. & 9D/10 POCSO Act & 3(2)V SC/ST Act and thus, he moved to the Court seeking regular bail. It was argued on his behalf that there is a general allegation in the FIR and as per the statements of the victim recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C., no ingredient of Section 376 I.P.C is made out. Further, it was argued that the parents of the victim refused the medical examination of the victim and that no injury had been found on the person of the victim. It was further argued that the father of the victim is a policeman and this FIR is only a misuse of that power. In view of this, the Court granted him bail as it noted that the parents of the victim denied any medical examination of the victim. Case title - Manoj Saxena v.

The Supreme Court observed that Motor Accident Compensation exceeding the claimed amount can be awarded. In the matter of compensation, the amount actually due and payable is to be awarded despite the claimants having sought for a lesser amount and the claim petition being valued at a lesser value, the bench comprising Justices observed. In this case, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal had awarded a sum of Rs.4,99,000/- with 6% interest. In appeal, the High Court enhanced the amount to Rs. 17,83,600/-. However, the High Court, taking into consideration that the valuation made in the Appeal was only for Rs. 6,50,000/-  awarded the said sum a enhanced compensation.  The issue raised before the Apex Court was whether the High Court was justified in restricting the award of the enhanced amount to Rs. 6,50,000/-  though, the amount of compensation determined was Rs. 12,84,600/-? "The law is well settled that in the matter of compensation, the amount actually due and payable is to be awarded despite the claimants having sought for a lesser amount and the claim petition being valued at a lesser value. Our view, is fortified by the decision of this Court in the Case of Ramla and Others Versus National Insurance Company Limited and Others 2019 2 SCC 192", the bench of Justices AS Bopanna and PS Narasimha observed while allowing the appeal. The court held that the claimants are entitled to the enhanced compensation of Rs. 12,84,600/- with 6% interest. In Ramla, the Supreme Court had observed thus: There is no restriction that the Court cannot award compensation exceeding the claimed amount, since the function of the Tribunal or Court under Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is to award "just compensation". The Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial and welfare legislation. A " just compensation" is one which is reasonable on the basis of evidence produced on record. It cannot be said to have become time-barred. Further, there is no need for a new cause of action to claim an enhanced amount. The Courts are duty-bound to award just compensation.

The Delhi High Court has observed that in matrimonial cases where settlement has taken place, offence under sec. 377 of Indian Penal Code can be compromised and FIR can be quashed as parties have to move ahead in life.  Justice Talwant Singh thus concurred with the decision of a coordinate bench in Rifakat Ali & Ors v. State & Anr. decided on February 26, 2021 wherein the Court had quashed an FIR under sec. 377 of IPC on the ground that the parties had compromised the matter with each other only because it arose out of a matrimonial dispute.  "So, the view of the co-ordinate bench is that in matrimonial cases, where settlement has taken place, even the offence under Section 377 IPC can be compromised and FIR can be quashed as parties have to move ahead in life. I concur with the said view," the Court observed in a ruling dated September 6.  The Court thus quashed an FIR registered under sec. 406, 498A, 354, 377 and 34 of IPC filed by a wife at Police Station Crime Women Cell, Nanak Pura.  The husband had approached the High Court seeking quashing of the FIR on the ground that the wife had settled all her disputes amicably with the husband and in laws and that a settlement was arrived at between the parties in September last year.  As per the settlement agreement, it was agreed that the husband shall pay lump sum amount of Rs.74,00,000 to the wife as full and final settlement towards all claims, Stridhan, child maintenance and permanent alimony whereas the wife shall invest out of the aforesaid sum, Rs. 10 lakhs in the name of their minor child for his benefit till he attains the age of majority. It was also agreed that the custody and guardianship of the minor child shall remain with wife who shall be the sole custodian of the child. It was agreed that the husband may have a video call with the child for one hour on his birthday or may alternatively meet the child for one hour in the week.  "Keeping in view the fact that parties have settled all their disputes, hence the offence under Section 354 IPC is also allowed to be quashed to put an end to all bickerings between the parties and allow them to begin a new chapter of their lives," the Court said.  While quashing the FIR, the Bench said that the parties shall remain bound by the terms of the settlement and the undertakings given to the Court. The plea was accordingly disposed of.
